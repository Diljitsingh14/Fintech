India is getting much love from global investors eager for alternatives to China at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nation-building drive has led to investment of billions of dollars for constructing roads, airports, bridges and power facilities.Bloomberg’s calculations rely on the last closing share prices and the latest shareholding in Indian stocks disclosed by GQG for four mutual funds and two others. This may not capture the US investment firm’s entire India exposure since it has other funds whose portfolio details are not available.The valuation of GQG’s Adani investment has vaulted to $7 billion, validation for Jain who cut against the grain when he bought shares worth $1.9 billion in March in the shortseller-stung conglomerate and then topped up some. But he and his fund managers have also bought several less flashy stocks in India that have surged over 50% this year, beating the 15% rise in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.What’s In, What’s OutThe largest fund, GQG Partners Emerging Markets Equity Fund, bought JSW Energy Ltd., Patanjali Foods Ltd., Macrotech Developers Ltd., Max Healthcare Institute Ltd. and IDFC First Bank Ltd. for the first time between April and September this year. It added ITC Ltd. — the fund’s largest bet — and State Bank of India Ltd. among other stocks, filings show.It also exited its holdings in Reliance Industries Ltd., Infosys Ltd., Cipla Ltd. and Bajaj Finserv Ltd. All of these have underperformed against the Sensex in 2023.A representative for GQG declined to comment on an emailed query seeking comments on their India investment strategy.Jain, who was born in India but moved to the US in 1990 for his MBA, co-founded GQG Partners in 2016 and has built it into a $113 billion powerhouse since. Unlike many of his peers, Jain doesn’t have a account on X, formerly known as Twitter, makes rare TV appearances and has little penchant for driverless-car companies or hypersonic-missile manufacturers.Instead, he buys into industries with a decidedly 20th-century feel: energy, tobacco, banking. GQG’s India stocks portfolio also mirrors this.In a June interview with Bloomberg, Jain said his firm plans to buy more of India stocks and downplayed the corporate governance and political risks that were weighing down the Adani Group.South Florida’s Anti-Cathie Wood Quietly Builds a Stock BehemothA total of nine GQG funds, that includes mutual funds, collective investments and managed funds, had investments worth $14.5 billion in India as of October end, or about 20% of their total assets under management, according to a Bloomberg analysis of filings. However, portfolio details are available for only six funds that have seen India investments surge by 125% since last year.Out-Sized BetsJain, known to like safe, defensive stocks and then make out-sized bets on them, grabbed investor attention globally when he bought into four Adani Group stocks in March — weeks after the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate was accused of corporate malfeasance by short-seller Hindenburg Research. The market rout wiped off more than $150 billion off Adani Group’s market value at one point despite denying these allegations.GQG didn’t just buy into Adani’s besieged stocks, it doubled down, with Jain calling them “one of the best infrastructure assets” in India. He said in an April interview with Bloomberg that Hindenburg’s accusations might look messy “from a Western point of view” but they were perhaps less problematic in the Indian business context.Adani Group’s market value, driven largely by a spurt over the past two weeks, has increased by about $80 billion since GQG’s March purchase.That said, not all of GQG’s picks have been outperformers. Some, such as HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. that its EM fund added this year, have lagged the Sensex.The overall impact on the portfolio, though, has been limited, thanks to the outsized gains in some of its other holdings, including Adani. And it doesn’t look like Jain is in it for the short term.Modi’s Nation-Building Push Spurs $125 Billion Industrials RallyWhile GQG likes “private sector banks, IT and consumer staples,” Jain spotlighted infrastructure as the sector to watch in India in the June interview with Bloomberg. “We feel infrastructure is the new story and still under appreciated,” he said then."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/c-suites-are-more-diverse-but-ceo-door-is-still-blocked-11873141.html,"C-suites are more diverse, but CEO door is still blocked","December 08, 2023 11:18 AM IST","There are signs that the door is starting to crack open. A study has found 49% of the C-suites of Fortune 500 companies are now made up of women and people from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial backgrounds. But just 10% of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, while 12% are people from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial groups","For decades, the pinnacle of corporate America has been a notorious boys’ club. If you need proof, just note that, until recently, at any given time through history more male chief executive officers named John were running big companies than the total number of women holding down the same job.There are signs that the door is starting to crack open, however. A study from executive search firm Spencer Stuart out this morning found that nearly half (49 percent) of the C-suites of Fortune 500 companies are now made up of women and people from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial backgrounds.Champions of diversity in corporate America should take a moment to celebrate a real victory here — one that not all that long ago seemed far out of reach. But the big headline number, which on the surface suggests progress, also risks becoming a distraction from some troubling trends hidden within the data.To get to nearly half the C-suite, executives who are women or are Black, indigenous or other people of colour have in large part capitalised on the creation of what’s considered “new” C-suite jobs. Spencer Stuart found that taken together, these two groups make up 89 percent of all chief inclusion and diversity officers and 64 percent of all chief sustainability officers — titles that after a rapid rise now exist at more than half of Fortune 500 companies.These roles have provided a way into the C-suite for those who have long been excluded, but what they haven’t provided is a pathway to the top. While overseeing a company’s climate initiatives and diversity efforts is critically important in today’s world, corporate boards don’t view them as important enough to be a steppingstone to the CEO job. And that’s a title where progress has been woefully slow. Just 10 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are women, while 12 percent are people from historically underrepresented ethnic and racial groups.A separate study from Spencer Stuart from last year found that CEOs tend to ascend from four “last-mile” roles: chief operating officer or president, division CEO, chief financial officer and “leapfrog” leaders promoted from below the C-suite. That tracks with what we know about the ways boards value CEO candidates with operating expertise and experience running a profit-and-loss statement. These jobs, however, are not ones that historically tend to be held by female or BIPOC executives. Instead, they tend to dominate in areas like human resources, where women make up 70 percent of the Fortune 500 chief HR officers. At least so far, that hasn’t tended to translate into a CEO job. A few years ago, when executive search firm Korn Ferry interviewed nearly 60 women who were current or former CEOs, not one of them had started her career in HR.Corporate America and the boards that lead it clearly don’t value all C-suite roles equally. Chief diversity officers, for example, have found themselves particularly vulnerable to the latest bout of corporate layoffs, a sign that they are viewed as more dispensable than other top executives. A LinkedIn study reported on by Bloomberg earlier this year found that the chief diversity and inclusion role was the fastest-growing C-suite position in 2020 and 2021, but the only one of the top-growing jobs to reverse hiring trends between 2021 and 2022.There are two solutions. If companies are truly committed to a more diverse pool of CEO candidates, they need to be more intentional about where they place talent earlier in their careers so they’re better positioned for those “last-mile” roles. Granted, it’s fair to question how real that commitment is with the ways companies have gutted their DEI departments in the last year. But there may actually have been some progress here, with the number of female CFOs on the rise.The alternative is for companies to reimagine what the path to the CEO job might look like. Could there be a day when it’s the norm for a chief diversity and inclusion officer or a chief sustainability officer to ascend to the CEO job? Let’s not forget that these jobs were created in the first place to help companies address some of the biggest and most pressing issues of our time. At the very least, it might be a smart move for corporations to start considering it. Beth Kowitt is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

The facility will likely have about 20 assembly lines and employ 50,000 workers within two years, according to the people, who declined to be named discussing unannounced plans. The goal is for the site to be operational in 12 to 18 months.The plant would bolster Apple’s efforts to localize its supply chain and strengthen its partnership with Tata, which already has an iPhone factory it acquired from Wistron Corp. in the neighboring Karnataka state. Apple is diversifying its operations away from China by working with assembly and component manufacturing partners in India, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere.An Apple spokesman declined to comment, while a Tata representative didn’t respond to a request for comment.The Indian conglomerate has taken other steps to increase its business with Apple and expand beyond its traditional businesses that range from salt to software. It has accelerated hiring at its existing facility in Hosur, where it produces iPhone enclosures, or metal casings. Tata has also said it’ll launch 100 retail stores focused on Apple products. For its part, Apple has opened two stores in the nation and is planning three more.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s production-linked subsidies have spurred Apple’s key suppliers such as Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp. to ramp up in India. That helped Apple assemble more than $7 billion of iPhones in India in the previous fiscal year, increasing the country’s share of the device’s production to about 7%. The rest are assembled in China, which until a few years ago made all of them.The new plant is set to be mid-sized among iPhone factories globally. It would likely be bigger than the one Tata acquired from Wistron, which employs more than 10,000 people, and smaller than Foxconn’s biggest China facilities that employ hundreds of thousands.Apple and Tata could likely urge the government to award subsidies for the new factory as it’s expected to begin production just as previous state-backed financial incentives are set to expire."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/constitutional-or-not-wealth-taxes-are-bad-economics-11867501.html,"Constitutional or not, wealth taxes are bad economics","December 07, 2023 10:15 AM IST","Subjecting companies to an annual tax on their value would create an incentive to keep companies private, because the firm's value will be easier to manipulate. A tax on unrealised gains would probably lead to wealthy people keeping most of their wealth in privately owned assets. This reduces transparency and deprives others the chance to invest in growing companies","The US Supreme Court heard arguments on Tuesday over a dispute over a $14,279 tax bill — and the slightly more consequential question of what counts as income under the federal tax code, a definition the Biden administration would like to expand.The tax bill at the center of the case belongs to Charles and Kathleen Moore, from an investment they made in India almost two decades ago. Although they have never realised any gains, their investment has done well, and changes to tax law passed in 2017 required them to pay taxes on its increased value. The Moores argue that they have not received any income from their investment and therefore should not be subject to any tax.Whether the Moores’ return is income or an unrealised gain is a difficult legal question. But to an economist the argument is simple: Wealth taxes, which are part of President Joe Biden’s 2024 budget proposal, are terrible policy. Taxes are a fact of life, everyone must pay them, the wealthy more than the less wealthy. But not all taxes are equal, and it’s important how a tax works. Some taxes are harder to implement than others, and some create greater economic distortions. Based on both of these criteria, taxing wealth — including unrealised gains — is the worst way to tax.Taxing the wealth of centimillionaires, as Biden proposes, may sound harmless; these are after all very rich people (though not billionaires). But implementing this tax would be very difficult. Very rich people often get that way by starting businesses, and they have a lot of their wealth tied up in their companies. Often these companies are privately owned, and therefore very difficult to value objectively.Even for publicly traded assets, the implementation of the tax would not be straightforward. On what day is the tax liability assessed? What if the value of the asset goes down between then and the day the tax is due? Will the government owe the centimillionaires money in the year their assets lose value? The US currently taxes capital gains, where these questions don’t come up or have a clear answer.Wealth taxes are also bad for the economy overall. Even owners of successful firms might not have enough cash to pay the tax on the value of their companies in any given year, especially if the tax is as much as 20 percent on unrealised gains, and may need to dilute their ownership. That means owners would have less control of their businesses.Subjecting companies to an annual tax on their value would create an incentive to keep companies private, because the value of the firm will be easier to manipulate. In fact, a tax on unrealised gains would probably lead to wealthy people keeping most of their wealth in privately owned assets. This not only reduces transparency it deprives everyday Americans from the chance to invest in growing companies. Yes, the government could create exceptions — no tax on certain kinds of assets, for example, or in certain sectors — but that would just result in more distortions and less transparency.True, there is already an estate tax. But it is assessed only once in a lifetime — and it is subject to all sorts of tricks to keep the liability down. There is a reason wealth is not taxed. Other countries tried and found wealth taxes to be more trouble than they’re worth. It is too easy to cheat, and people end up moving their money around — out of the country or in hard-to-value assets such art, instead of in the local economy.To repeat: Yes, the US needs more tax revenue, and yes, very rich Americans could pay more. But there are better ways to raise the money than through a wealth tax. The government could tax the increase in the value of an estate when it is passed on. There could be more progressive consumption taxes on luxury goods.Taxing wealth is a bad idea, even for the wealthiest people. No matter what the court decides, politicians should perish the thought of taxing unrealised gains and focus on more sensible ways to raise revenue.Allison Schrager  is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Jain acquired Adani shares weeks after a shortseller report had battered the ports-to-power conglomerate and wiped out more $150 billion in market value.Flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. and two other group firms have more than doubled from the price GQG paid for them. The value of its investments in the Adani Group, initially about $1.9 billion with some more purchased along the way, has risen to more than $7 billion as of last week, according to the firm.“We remain excited about the fundamentals of each of these businesses,” Sudarshan Murthy, a portfolio manager at GQG, said in an interview this week, adding that the investment firm had been net buyers of Adani stocks this quarter.Murthy, who co-manages some of the GQG funds along with Jain, declined to comment on the profits made from investments in the Adani conglomerate.Jain’s investment — which came near the trough of the Adani stock meltdown — has been boosted by a rally in this week after the conglomerate’s green energy unit secured a $1.4 billion loan and a Bloomberg News report said US government found shortseller Hindenburg Research’s allegations irrelevant while advancing a $553 loan for Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.’s Sri Lanka project.That news is “a big deal,” Murthy said, commenting on the US government’s stance.Adani Group’s stocks also saw a relief rally in its shares late last month after India’s top court said it won’t take scathing media reports on the conglomerate as the “gospel truth” even as it reserved verdict on its probe into Hindenburg’s allegations.In recent months, the conglomerate has successfully refinanced a $3.5 billion loan as well as acquired a local cement maker, demonstrating its ability to bounce back after the Hindenburg broadside in January that accused the conglomerate of accounting fraud and stock price manipulation.The Adani Group, whose market value is still about $60 billion short of the pre-Hindenburg level, has strongly denied these allegations.Jain, who cut against the grain when he bought Adani shares in March, told Bloomberg in an April interview that these investments “could be multibaggers” over five years.GQG holds an equity stake in Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports, Adani Green Energy Ltd., Adani Power Ltd., Adani Energy Solutions Ltd. and Ambuja Cements Ltd."

That’s because the contractual documents of two Adani Green securities require several months advance notice. In one case, the deadline for a refinancing plan is on Friday.“We are coming close to timelines where we would like to see a concrete and definitive plan” Abhishek Dangra, a Singapore-based infrastructure analyst at S&P Global said.While there have been no suggestions Adani won’t meet the deadlines and the conglomerate even pre-paid debt this year, its finances are under scrutiny after Hindenburg’s allegations of malfeasance triggered a spike in its dollar bond yields. Adani relies on the global market for 80% of its debt raising, according to its chief financial officer. The group denied all of Hindenburg’s claims and called them “bogus.”The group and its bankers have begun exploratory talks about financing plans, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. The group is exploring multiple options for the Adani Green bonds due in 2024, such as refinancing them with new notes or taking out a loan, they said.The first note to come due in 2024 is one by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., while debt issued by Green matures on Sept. 8. That bond requires a roadmap be submitted nine months ahead of the date of maturity. That’s on Friday.The security sold by Green and its subsidiaries due on Dec. 10 mandates a finance plan be submitted to noteholders at least 12 months and one day in advance of the due date, according to the offering circular seen by Bloomberg. That deadline would be on Saturday.A spokesman for Adani did note respond when asked by Bloomberg about plans for the maturing bonds and whether investors had been informed of them. The representative also didn’t comment on the talks with bankers.While S&P doesn’t rate Adani Green, it does rate the December 2024 debt issued by its subsidiary companies under the Adani Green Restricted Group 1 umbrella. Dangra, the analyst, said the Ports business had enough cash on hand and a healthy cash flow so as to redeem its 2024 bond from its own funds.Group CFO Jugeshinder Singh already touched on the conglomerate’s objectives, saying at an event in Mumbai on Dec. 1 that Adani Green would be one of the firms issuing dollar bonds over the next year. The group will also infuse money to repay that unit’s bonds maturing in September and December next year, potentially in July to avoid a prepayment penalty, Singh said.He also told reporters on Friday that the Adani Green December bond “is the one we need to refinance.” When asked about the September bond, he said a refinancing plan had been announced in July, without elaborating.The Adani Ports debt will be redeemed “out of its cash,” he said.The company spokesman didn’t respond to Bloomberg’s request for clarifications on the CFO’s remarks, including details on the refinancing plan announced in July.Having been forced to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale as a result of allegations of fraud and malfeasance levied by Hindenburg Research in late January, Adani and his lieutenants have sought to burnish their image as reliable borrowers.They prepaid debt, held in-person meetings from Hong Kong to London to reassure investors, and spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying back the debt of units including Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd. and Adani Ports.Adani successfully refinanced the debt to purchase Ambuja Cements Ltd. and ACC Ltd., and it also won fresh equity capital from GQG Partners LLC.Just this week, Adani Green Energy raised a $1.4 billion loan for a renewable energy project in Gujarat. Its shares surged by a record 20% in a single day on the news.“The group has demonstrated access to equity funding,” Dangra said. “We have seen external lenders extending credit lines. We now have to see capital market access - that is the next step.”"

In 2021, JSW Cement, its cement arm, entered into definitive agreements to raise up to Rs. 1,500 crore from two global PE investors, Apollo Global Management Inc (through its managed funds) and Synergy Metals Investments Holding.Under the deal, compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS) were issued to the investors with the conversion of CCPS into common equity of the company linked to the company’s performance and valuation determined at the time of the initial public offering.Established in 2016, JSW Paints is a relatively recent entrant in the industry. The company is into both industrial and decorative paints, operating from two plants in Vasind, Maharashtra, and Vijayanagar, Karnataka. The Vasind facility boasts an annual installed capacity of 40,000 kilolitres, focusing on industrial paints, while the Vijayanagar unit is dedicated to decorative paints with a capacity of 90,000 kilolitres per annum.In July 2021, the BSE- and National Stock Exchange-listed JSW Steel infused Rs 750 crore into JSW Paints. The initial tranche of Rs 300 crore was allocated for a 7.5 percent stake in the issued and paid-up equity capital of JSW Paints and a 6.88 percent stake on a fully diluted basis. Subsequent tranches of Rs 250 crore in FY23 and Rs 200 crore in FY24 were planned to complete the investment."

But now that the local saver is getting entangled, expect an end to private funds’ freewheeling ways","There are plenty of high-performing private investment vehicles in India, but it’s the few that are being set up for dubious purposes that may bring harsher regulatory scrutiny to the country’s most rapidly expanding asset class.So far, the most egregious use of these so-called alternative investment funds has been by nonbank finance companies, several of whom have employed these bespoke structures for pure regulatory arbitrage.When it looked like their big-ticket borrowers, especially real-estate projects, were going to default, some financiers took recourse to new funds tailormade for them by Wall Street firms. Investors who pooled money were issued senior securities, earning them interest. The finance company also contributed, but in a smaller junior tranche that ranks lower down in the repayment pecking order and is the first to absorb any losses.The private funds then lent money to the same stressed borrowers who, in turn, repaid their original loans and avoided bankruptcy proceedings. Finance companies were happy, too, since any mark-to-market losses on the securities they now held would be far lower than the provisioning burden they would have had to bear in case of soured credit.This is how at least some shadow lenders in India have “evergreened” their loan books to avoid being on the radar of the Reserve Bank of India, their regulator. But the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the stock-market watchdog, has cottoned on to the sleight of hand. According to a Reuters report in October, the SEBI has detected at least a dozen cases involving $1.8 billion to $2.4 billion where alternative investment funds have been misused to sidestep other financial regulators including the RBI.The amounts involved may be small, but the problem with such shady practices is that they invariably lead to stiff regulation. And that could slow down the blistering growth of alternative funds, a broad category that includes venture capital, private equity, real estate funds, and private credit. A prominent Mumbai-based PE investor pointed out to me that it’s mostly the Wall Street firms that sponsored the cute structures. The same marquee buyout specialists will be the first to complain when, as a direct consequence, regulation in India takes a sterner turn. The lawyers who advised on these deals would wash their hands off.Currently, it’s international investors who dominate the alternative-asset landscape in the world’s most-loved emerging market. But a rising number of affluent Indians are also looking at them for returns superior to what they can get from public equity, debt and residential real estate. For a growing class of high-net-worth individuals, the minimum ticket size —  10 million rupees ($120,000) — is not a showstopper.However, the game will not stop with the rich. Domestic institutions’ participation will increase, too, once insurance and pension firms are given more leeway to invest in alternative assets. Since that will indirectly bring the regular Indian saver to the rich person’s playground, it’s one big reason why the SEBI can’t afford to ignore the dodgy structures. A global PE sponsor buying a riskier portion of a fund would be par for the course, but a local nonbank finance company that’s not the sponsor providing a loan-loss cushion to make its balance sheet look good? Or a big internationalretailer using a fund to get around New Delhi’s foreign direct investment limits? The regulators are losing their patience.The zeitgeist is in SEBI’s favor. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, under Chair Gary Gensler, came out with rules in August to tighten its grip on hedge funds and private equity. Their industry associations have sued the SEC, alleging that the agency has gone too far and that the new rules “would fundamentally change the way private funds are regulated in America.”Which is perhaps why the SEBI wants to act early. The alternative-asset industry in India has venture capital and hedge funds as its two bookends. The main body, however, consists of private equity and private credit. Whereas just a decade ago these two asset classes were a $200 million sideshow, now they command $83 billion, or more than four-fifths of the $100 billion committed by investors to private funds.If this past growth is any guide, it won’t take too long for the firepower to grow to a point where the industry can flex its lobbying muscles — both in New Delhi and Washington — to thwart any attempt to rein it in. Even now, it isn’t exactly easy for SEBI. A tussle between the regulator and the fund lobby has been playing out for more than a year, the Economic Timesreported in July.The stakes are increasing on both sides. Alternative funds will continue to be the fastest-growing segment of India’s investment landscape, CRISIL, an affiliate of S&P Global Inc, noted in a report last year. That growth has been made possible by light-touch regulation: As conduits of foreign capital into the country, the industry has enjoyed a lot of latitude. But now that the local saver is getting entangled, expect an end to private funds’ freewheeling ways. Global PE firms’ questionable deals have made that outcome inevitable.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication.  Credit: Bloomberg "

In June 2021, the company also underwent layoffs, affecting 200 employees.During the pandemic-hit FY21, the company witnessed a decline in revenues to Rs 74 crore due to the shutdown or restricted operations of multiplexes and live events.With the resurgence of people returning to theaters and a high demand for on-ground events, BookMyShow's revenue from operations soared 3.5 times to Rs 976 crore, compared to Rs 277 crore in FY22, as per financial statements from the Registrar of Companies.In the calendar year 2022, India's box office (BO) revenue reached Rs 10,637 crore, nearly matching the pre-Covid level of Rs 10,948 crore in 2019. The year 2023 is anticipated to be a record-breaking year for the BO, with estimated revenues touching Rs 12,000 crore.The majority of the company's income, constituting 66 percent of total operating revenue, came from ticket sales, amounting to Rs 648 crore in FY23—an increase of 2.85 times from Rs 227 crore in FY22.Income from live events also experienced significant growth, reaching Rs 237 crore in FY23, a substantial increase of 9.5 times.The company reported a total revenue of Rs 1026 crore in FY23, inclusive of income from advertising, marketing, streaming, and the sale of food and beverages.On the expense side, the major cost for the company was the commission paid to theatre owners, accounting for 31.3 percent of the total expenditure. The company's costs increased 2.4 times to Rs 295 crore from Rs 120 crore in FY22, with the total expenditure in FY23 standing at Rs 941 crore—an increase of 2.38 times from Rs 395 crore in FY22."

She noted that it would be great to see an idea to go from laboratory to market in less than a year.""Now, how do we do that? The way we do that is to really look at, you know, completely reforming our regulatory process,"" she stated.She also noted that the regulations currently depend a lot on iterative processes, trial and error, and of course, human subjectivity and interpretation of that data.""Just think about how you can actually turn it on its head if you use technology. The iterative process can be made much more predictable. By just using generative AI, data analytics to really come up with algorithms that allow you a greater probability of success, a greater predictability in how you're going to deliver on these products,"" she stated.Mazumdar-Shaw said regulators have been very slow adopters of technology in leveraging technology for product approvals.""..tech savvy regulators are very, very crucial to what we're trying to do. If you do not have technically skilled and technology aware regulatory reviewers, I don't think we can really deliver on this promise of accelerated approvals,"" she noted.Citing the example of the IT sector, Mazumdar-Shaw noted that the regulations governing the segment allows one to take an idea to the market in a very short period of time.""That's why investors are very excited because they're willing to back new ideas because either it works or it doesn't work...in our sector, it takes years, you know, sometimes even 10 years to take an idea to the market... And that makes it very difficult for investors to back these new ideas in biotech,"" she stated.She further said: ""I think technology can compress these timelines."""

It comes after years of American efforts to counter growing Chinese influence in the region as a result of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative to build infrastructure around the globe.The Adani Group has denied the allegations featured in the Hindenburg report, including stock-price manipulation.

Adani stocks have rallied of late, and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. has gained 7.4% so far this year.The Adani Group, which has attracted controversy for its giant Australia coal mine and for the billionaire’s perceived closeness with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has touted the DFC’s investment as a vote of confidence following the Hindenburg allegations.“We see this as a reaffirmation by the international community of our vision, our capabilities and our governance,” Karan Adani, the tycoon’s son and chief executive officer at Adani Ports, told reporters in Colombo when the deal was announced."

The steep climb led the government to mandate the addition of both renewable and thermal capacity to prevent blackouts.Billionaire Gautam Adani’s clean energy unit saw its installed capacity more than double in the past two years, with profits riding on the expansion. That helped win back investors’ confidence after the tycoon’s wider group faced allegations of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud by a U.S. short seller in January, charges the group has vehemently denied.India, which currently gets nearly 70% of its electricity from coal, is seeking to reduce its reliance on the fuel by reaching 500 gigawatt of clean capacity by 2030. The goal is being championed by the country’s business tycoons, including Adani, Mukesh Ambani and other state-run energy enterprises.The nation’s dependence on fossil fuels casts shadow over its ability to meet its carbon neutrality target by 2070.Adani Green plans to spend $4.5 billion and add 8 gigawatt of installed capacity over the two years through March 2025, eventually reaching 45 gigawatt by the end of this decade.To get to that target, merely maintaining the current installation pace won’t be enough, Singh said. “We need to up the ante and increase our pace of installation,” he said."

Over Pepe Jeans' expansion plans, Kapoor told PTI, ""We will add 100 odd stores in the next three years and in terms of a turnover, we are looking at a CAGR growth of 18 to 20 per cent.

But more importantly, Pepe Jeans grew almost 42 per cent, as compared to the pre-COVID numbers, he added.According to Kapoor, in the last two to three years, Pepe Jeans has become a consumer-centric company and is focusing on trends and the digital side of the business. ""We have a very clear focus in terms of direct-to-consumer sales. So whether it is through online or through stores, retail and e-commerce are going to be our biggest focus,"" he said.Kapoor said Pepe Jeans London is getting a ""bigger proportion"" of its growth coming from small tier II & III markets, amid rising disposable income, exposure to information related to trends for current brands helped by increasing internet penetration etc. ""Today the aspirations of these consumers (tier II & III) are similar to a consumer of a metro city.""These guys have similar sort of disposable incomes and are willing to buy. e-commerce as a platform has provided us an opportunity where we can reach out to consumers or even cities which are like one lakh sort of population. So, accessibility has also become easier,"" he added.Currently, the top eight cities contribute to around 58 per cent of the Pepe Jeans business and the rest 42 per cent comes from tier II and below markets.In the premium denim space, Pepe Jeans London is the second leading brand in the segment. The premium denim space is led by US-based jeans manufacturing brand Levi's. Pepe Jeans London also owns brands such as Hackett and Faonnable. It is also the licensed distributor for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in Spain and Portugal.The brand Pepe Jeans London has been present in India since 1988."

""This year we will grow by a good healthy margin... Our EBITDA would have improved dramatically from last year. We will be near break-even this year and next year is when we really will be able to show significant profits."" Founded in 2008, Practo connects doctors with patients and offers several ancillary services such as telemedicine.Income from diagnostic and consulting services formed 50 per cent of the total operating revenue. In the 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023), the Bengaluru-headquartered firm halved its losses to Rs 93.68 crore. Revenues grew 3 per cent year-on-year to Rs 194.53 crore and Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) improved 39 per cent.Income from diagnostic and consulting services formed 50 per cent of total operating revenue with the rest coming from subscription services, sale of software and maintenance offered to doctors and clinics. He said the company is looking at full-year profitability next fiscal, as it looks for sustainable growth, while delivering exceptional service through a full-stack model.Backed by China's Tencent and venture capital funds Peak XV Partners and Matrix Partners, it is also planning an offline presence in primary and secondary healthcare through Practo-branded clinics. ""I think that's something that we have cracked and now it's for us to continue to grow at a rapid pace,"" he said.Also on radar is a listing. ""Yes, we would like to go public. I can't give timelines but yes soon,"" he added. ""I do see the company going public soon, but I don't think there's any particular timeline for it. Two years, three years from now, we need to see.""Terming the domestic market as a priority for the company, he stated that Practo would go ""deeper into different geographies"" over the next few years.The company connects around 15 crore people annually with doctors in India with 6-7 top cities accounting for more than 50 per cent of the business.Having established itself in the big cities, the focus is now toexpand operations in Tier and Tier 3 cities and towns, Shashank stated.""We've made a lot of good progress and we've been number one with very large market share. Now we believe that the next phase is to create a more omni-channel approach where online and offline, you know, kind of go hand in hand,"" he noted.The advent of AI has really opened new possibilities in the healthcare segment to analyse a lot of data and to provide much better analysis, he said.""Even a 2 per cent improvement in quality means a life saved in healthcare. So, these are a couple of areas that you know, broadly we are really focusing on going forward,"" Shashank ND stated. He noted that the company is well capitalised and there were no immediate plans to raise funds.Practo, which has so far raised around USD 230 million in multiple funding rounds, is present in over countries, helping over 30 crore patients by connecting them with around 1.5 lakh verified doctor partners. Shashank said that the company would like to focus on strengthening its existing businesses while staying away from other verticals like diagnostics.""If you look at the private providers (segment) it is about USD 100 billion space in India. It's a very very large space. No doubt diagnostics and others have very good margins.. But I think the provider side itself is a very large space... So I think we're very comfortable staying on the provider side,"" he noted."

Catalytic dewaxing is used in base oil production. IOC owns and operates nine of the country's nearly two-dozen refineries. The total capacity under its operations is 70.1 million tonnes per annum.In its latest annual report, the firm says, ""By 2026, our approved projects will significantly increase our crude oil refining capacity from the current 70.05 million tonnes per annum to 87.9 million tonnes.""In August, the company had awarded a contract to McDermott International Ltd to provide a suite of services for further expansions of olefins and polymers production at Panipat refining and chemical complex.Designed to improve operational flexibility of the refinery to help meet domestic energy demand, the Panipat capacity expansion project would increase production of petrochemicals and value-added specialty products to elevate margins and derisk IOC's company wide exposure to its conventional fuel business via addition of new units at the integrated olefins and aromatics complex.IOC's phase-two naphtha cracker unit (NCU) expansion project is expected to increase the ethylene production capacity by around 20 per cent.Besides, owning 28 per cent of the nation's oil refining capacity, IOC also owns 36,792 out of 88,248 petrol pumps in the country. IOC said its board has also approved ""procurement and installation of 4,000 fast electric vehicle chargers at an estimated capital investment of Rs 919.78 crore.""The firm is investing heavily into alternate energy sources, as part of a broader transition the country is making in pivoting away from fossil-fuels. EV charging stations are one of them. India's domestic demand for chemicals and petrochemicals is slated to nearly triple from current levels by 2040."

We are talking to multiple Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and told them if you want to adopt it, we will help fast-track that journey,"" Phokela told PTI.""Our engineers can come and work with your engineers so that you don't have a steep learning curve. We have already made the investments. We already know technologies, we will just help you adopt,"" Phokela told PTI.He was responding to a query on if Ather is willing to share its expertise of its charging connector with other EV makers. In October this year, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) had approved Ather Energy's indigenously developed AC and DC combined charging connector as standard for light electric vehicles (LEVs) -- electric two- and three-wheelers, along with micro cars.""We are not looking to charge money for this... If I take a larger philosophical view on this one, we do not want to compete on the infrastructure. We want to collaborate on the charging side and compete on the vehicle side. We want to fast-track the harmonisation of charging infrastructure,"" Phokela said.He said Ather's charging connector has only been defined as a standard and there is no obligation for any OEM to adopt it.""It is a flexible decision to take and not a mandate. They will come on board only if there is compatibility,"" Phokela said. Underlining the significance of having a standardised charging connector, he said, ""What this allows the industry is that if you standardise the charging infrastructure, it harmonises the individual solutions that many other players have.""This augurs well for the industry because if the charging infrastructure can be harmonised, it provides an incentive for independent businesses to set up infrastructure, Phokela added.So far, in the absence of a harmonised standard, independent businesses who wanted to set up charging stations have been unsure as to for which EV maker the charging infrastructure must be set up. Now it also increases opportunities for chargepoint operators.From a customer's point of view, he said if more charging points are available, it addresses the range anxiety, as they can use their electric two-wheelers just like a conventional scooter. Besides, it helps the government identify as to whom incentives should be given for developing charging infrastructure instead of looking at individual OEMs, he added.Asked about Ather's plans for increasing the charging network, he said, ""We have about 1,600 charging locations. We have very strong plans for growth over the next few years. We hope to get about 2,500 charging stations by March 2024."" In the next fiscal, Phokela said the number could go up to about 5,000."

The interview is lightly edited for clarity:How has GIFT developed since the creation of the IFSCA?GIFT City started in 2007 as a completely greenfield experiment when PM Modi was the chief minister of the state of Gujarat. In 2020 the government created the IFSCA as a unified regulator. It has issued more than 30 regulations for industries including aircraft leasing, ship leasing. In the financial domain we have banks, funds, capital markets and insurance.The number of licensed/registered entities has grown to more than 550 in September 2023 versus 129 in the same month of 2020. We have more than 25 banks, up from 13 in 2020. We have two international stock exchanges offering 20-plus hours of trading in various product categories including index, stock, currency and commodity derivatives.What does it indicate for the debt market?Cumulative debt listing at GIFT IFSC stock exchanges was at $52.7 billion as on Sept. 30, 2023. Out of which $10.18 billion of debt listing was related to environment, social and governance bonds. We expect the GIFT IFSC bond market to gain traction as inflation and interest concerns abate.How will you simplify processes?The idea is to create a fairly level playing field for a global player to come here and to provide a fair amount of tax certainty, policy certainty, and also ease of doing business.  We are now in the process of launching a single window IT system, which will enable entities to obtain all (regulatory) clearances in a single window. This will likely be launched sometime in January.What are your plans for growth?One: Direct listing of the securities of unlisted Indian companies at the IFSC based exchanges. Two: Enable IFSC to become a Re-insurance hub. Three: Enabling bookkeeping, accounting, taxation and financial crime compliance services as finance services in the international financial center. Four: Single window IT System for registration and approval of entities in GIFT IFSC. Five: Permitting acquisition financing. Besides, there are others like entry for foreign universities that want to set up campuses, transition finance.We are in the process of rolling out a payment services regulation, enabling instant clearances for banks, which will reduce the friction for the financial ecosystem out here. It may take about six months or so.Then there are our plans for the pensions sector. There are millions of people in the Indian diaspora who are working abroad and many of them would like to save in dollars. This is an opportunity for us. A team is working on it and is likely to submit a report maybe by December after which we are likely to come out with a set of pension regulations wherein people can do their pension savings out of this place.What benefits do you see from direct listings? We see a lot of unlisted companies in India, typically startups, tech companies. They do not generally get those kind of valuations which they obtain in international marketplace. So we would expect them to come and list out of this place because there’ll be more traction for foreign players to come and buy stocks, which are denominated in foreign currencies. We expect the finance ministry to notify those regulations shortly.What are your two big challenges?Sudden surge in number of applications at the GIFT IFSC has outpaced the infrastructure development, but significant inventory is expected to be out in near future. IFSCA has dual role of regulator as well as developer. It is important for all stakeholders to maintain the coherent approach and deliver efficiently and fast. We expect to maintain the momentum.Will GIFT IFSC look at carbon credits?There are two committees, formed more than a month ago, which are looking at the voluntary carbon credit market because India is a large producer of carbon credits. So it exports a lot of carbon credits. So here is an opportunity for us to actually provide a international trading platform for carbon credits. So we are working on that. We expect that committee maybe in the next month or two to produce a report."

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. As Nifty reclaims the coveted 20,000 level today, investors seem to have everything in place and a place for more. Predictions of India’s benchmark equity index scaling higher levels have always been around and such instances warrant some more predictions. But we are not here to predict, we are here to crack the investment code that Berkshire Hathaway’s two gentlemen did effortlessly. We are here to pay respects to one of them and as we do, wonder what would have Charlie Munger said about Nifty?Munger was the formidable force or the brains behind Warren Buffett’s riches and his badge of ‘Oracle of Omaha’. As Buffett’s trusted partner and vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Munger has been the pivotal force that fetched the company its impeccable record of investments returns.Munger’s investment philosophy was simple: you fold when the stakes are against you or in other words, you cut your losses. But when you have an edge, you bet big. These big bets were the ones that not only compensated Berkshire for the losses it took on other not-so-smart bets, but also earned the company lip-smacking returns. His obituary by The Financial Times, free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers, reflects on Munger’s personality, his contribution and his style.According to Buffett, Munger expanded his investment strategy away from his former mentor Ben Graham’s. Graham is known as the father of value investing and fostered an investment strategy that looks for cheap companies to buy that will create value over time. “The cardinal error in Graham’s approach, Munger believed, was that he was trying to avoid the kind of pain he experienced in the Great Crash of 1929 by seeking out bargains. But it also meant that Graham was missing scores of wonderful companies that were trading at fair prices,” the FT piece says.What companies are wonderfully priced at Nifty Mount 20k and worth Munger’s big bet?While picking so-called multi-baggers is tricky, our research team provides the reasons why some firms look promising on the growth front. If you have conviction on India’s consumption growth, the Tata Group’s Trent Ltd’s strong earnings show and rapid network expansion support its growth ambitions. Craft Automation in the auto ancillary industry has multiple levers that would help its revenues in the coming quarters, Nitin Agrawal points out.Before we make investment decisions, it is pertinent to remember that Buffett and Munger’s success was also based on their capacity to wait, rather than buy and sell willy-nilly.But what are we waiting for? There are a list of factors to watch for as pointed out by Ridham Desai, managing director at Morgan Stanley in a comprehensive interview here with my colleague N Mahalakshmi. Desai believes that an earnings upside is not fully priced in by the markets and that earnings growth could exceed 20 percent annually over the next four years. Meanwhile, Desai lists six factors that investors must look for in the new year, one of which is the US Federal Reserve’s rate cuts.In fact, the source of optimistic sentiment that is driving Nifty up Mount 20k is growing expectation that the US Federal Reserve could soon explore rate cuts. Fed governor Christopher Waller indicated that rates could begin to fall if “inflation is really down”. If the Fed rate cuts are around the corner, that would mean the cost of capital globally could get cheap. It would also help dollar inflows into emerging markets such as India.Stock markets reflect the underlying economy, at least somewhat. India’s economic growth has been one of the factors keeping its equity investors happy. The second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be out this week and the number is likely to be robust. My colleague Manas Chakravarty gives the highlights of what to expect here.At any given point in time, equity investors have multiple areas to look at before making decisions and many a time, the sheer number of events can overwhelm.Here is a Munger gem that gives some clarity: “Part of [having uncommon sense] is being able to tune out folly, as opposed to recognising wisdom. If you bat away many things, you don't clutter yourself.”Investing insights from our research teamPCBL: Do the unrelated M&As dampen the investment argument?What else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Algo firms find Snowman hot, Man on the move, Big Papa’s dilemma, small fryCan green energy help NTPC realise its valuation potential?RBI sees risks in how banks treat deposits or retail customersChart of the Day: Index inclusion demolishes the rate differential argument for India’s bondsGujarat’s marketing acumen can be a template for other statesAI Global Regulations: What’s needed?China’s low-carbon success highlights cracks in its political systemCOP28: India must highlight perils of a one-size-fits-all strategy on phasing down fossil fuel useCOP28: Carbon capture at ultra-supercritical coal power plants can meet India’s developmental, green goalsCOP28: Come together for fair and balanced energy transitionThe Global South has lost faith in COP28Chinese are making a killing everywhere but in ChinaDigital cash will survive the crypto winterTelangana Elections 2023: Will KCR’s risky bet of tickets to nearly all his sitting MLAs pay off?Why RBI's credit risk weightage move could be a setback for PaytmMarketsEicher stock advances 14% in a month.

Our all-inclusive guide on how to start an LLC offers expert guidance and in-depth instructions.,"If you're looking to transform your enthusiasm into a profitable venture, starting an LLC is a widely acknowledged means to safeguard your individual assets and obtain the advantages of a structured business setup. However, where should you commence?This article will steer you through the procedure of how to open an LLC, right from selecting a name to completing formalities, allowing you to concentrate on expanding your enterprise with assurance. So, let's begin!>> Try Out ZenBusiness Now! >>How to Start an LLC in 7 Simple StepsA lot of small business proprietors choose to open an LLC (Limited Liability Company) due to the security it offers against liability. An LLC is a distinct legal entity from its proprietors or members, which means that the members aren't personally accountable for the business's debts. To set up how to start an LLC, you'll need to submit the appropriate documentation to the state where your business is situated. Each state has its own set of regulations and procedures, but there are some common steps you'll need to take, regardless of your location, to begin operating your LLC.The following are steps on how to get an LLCStep 1: Choose and Reserve a Name for Your LLCIn most states, it’s not permitted for two different business entities to open an LLC and share the same name, regardless of their location. This means that if you have a business called ""Joe's Donuts, LLC,"" you cannot have another business named ""Joe's Donuts, Inc."" Also, some states have limitations on specific words that businesses can use in their names, like the word ""bank."" It’s advisable to search online for existing business names in your state to check if your proposed LLC name is available before filing the necessary paperwork.Apart from adhering to state law regulations, it’s advisable to research to determine if other similar businesses in your locality are utilizing identical or comparable names. Opting for a unique name can help prevent confusion and legal claims related to trademark infringement. It may be worth checking if a domain name that aligns with your business name is available. In case you open an LLC, you have decided on an LLC name that’s available, but you don't plan to register your business documents immediately. You may want to reserve the name until you open an LLC. Most states allow you to reserve a name for a specific period by submitting a form and paying a reservation fee. The length of the reservation period, charges, and renewal policies vary from state to state.Step 2: Choose a Registered AgentIn almost all states, to open an LLC, one is required to designate a registered agent, also known as a statutory agent. This agent is responsible for receiving legal documents, such as lawsuits and subpoenas, on behalf of the LLC and forwarding them to the appropriate person within the organization. As per state laws, any state resident over 18 years of age, including a member or officer of the LLC, can serve as a registered agent. Alternatively, companies such as Northwest Registered Agent offer professional registered agent services at a cost.Step 3: File Organization Paperwork With the StateTo open an LLC varies from state to state and involves specific procedures. Typically, one needs to submit articles of organization that specify details like:The LLC's name and address The duration of its existence (unless it’s perpetual)The registered agent's name and addressThe intended purpose for forming the LLCThe signature of the person forming the LLC In certain states, the registered agent's signature may also be requiredWhen getting on how to start an LLC, the usual process is to submit the necessary paperwork to the secretary of state in the majority of states. However, a few states have an alternative agency responsible for managing business filings. While all states require a filing fee, the cost to open an LLC differs among states.Step 4: Prepare an LLC Operating AgreementThe LLC operating agreement outlines the guidelines for managing your LLC. It covers crucial details like the distribution of ownership interests and voting rights among members, the allocation of profits and losses, protocols for conducting meetings, governance of the business, member rights in case of death or departure, and the dissolution process in case of a business closure. All of these elements are essential for the smooth operation of the LLC.The state may not require the operating agreement to be filed, and it may not be mandatory by state laws. Nonetheless, entrepreneurs must utilize this document as it enables them to establish their obligations and rights and lessen potential conflicts.Step 5: Determine the Licenses NeededThe state may not require the operating agreement to be filed, and it may not be mandatory by state laws. Nonetheless, entrepreneurs must utilize this document as it enables them to establish their obligations and rights and lessen potential conflicts when they open an LLC.Step 6: Get an EINTo proceed to open an LLC, obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN), which serves as a Social Security Number for your business. The EIN is an exclusive identification number that’s vital for various business requirements, such as banking, taxation, and recruitment of employees.Step 7: Register to Do Business in Other States (Optional)If your LLC operates in multiple states, it may be necessary to register your business in those states. To register, you'll need to complete paperwork similar to what was done during the formation of your LLC. Additionally, a registered agent must be present in each state where your LLC is authorized to do business. LLCs are a popular business choice for small business owners due to their flexibility and ease of maintenance, but it’s crucial to properly fill out paperwork and establish an operating agreement to define member rights and responsibilities.>> Try Out ZenBusiness Now >>Important Steps to Follow After Forming an LLCFile Annual ReportsOkay, this step is usually applicable after you’ve been trading for a tax year, but it’s useful to know it now. An annual report, also known as a “statement of information”, provides your state with crucial details relating to your business, including any changes or information that occurred since your last filing period. This enables your state to inform you of any added legal requirements, such as licenses you might need to continue doing business.  A good piece of advice when one needs to open an LLC is to start a system that records all your business’s dealings. This way, you won’t have to spend days or weeks looking for necessary paperwork with a deadline looming ever closer.What Should You Include in Your Annual Report?Include your LLC name, office address, your registered agent’s information (if you’ve used one), and the LLC number that your secretary of state provided upon forming. Each state has its own LLC laws and regulations and varying requirements for inclusion in an annual report. When it comes to providing information about your business, certain key details should not be left out. These include your primary business addressThe names and addresses of your members and managers Any important identification numbers associated with your business (such as your state entity number)The purpose of your business A list of authorized signatoriesInformation regarding your registered agent, and instructions on how to file your annual reportIf you own an LLC, submit an annual report to the state, and this can be done through the state's website. It’s important to note that a fee is required to submit this report, and the amount varies depending on the state. For instance, Mississippi charges $50, while Massachusetts charges $500.What Happens if You Don’t File an Annual Report for Your LLC?Even though it may appear as a mere formality, submitting your yearly report within the deadline is crucial, as the repercussions of not doing so can be severe. In certain states, you may face late charges, fines, and levies, and in some instances, your Limited Liability Company may be dissolved.Open a Business Bank AccountEven though state and federal laws don't mandate LLC owners to have a distinct business account, it’s advisable to have one due to various compelling reasons.If you don’t open a business account, you may risk losing your limited liability protection as it separates your personal and business finances. It’s important to have a separate entity to increase the likelihood of maintaining your protection.Creating a distinct bank account for your LLC can enhance the image of your business by projecting a sense of reliability and expertise.It’s much simpler to have a clear understanding of your financial situation when you maintain separate accounts for your personal and business transactions. The feature also aids your accountant in determining which expenses are business-related and which ones are personal. This is particularly beneficial when preparing your tax return at the end of the year. Keeping track of your business expenses helps maintain a steady cash flow.Obtain the Required Business Licenses and PermitsWhile forming an LLC in many states does not require a business license, it’s essential to obtain one along with other permits to ensure that the LLC operates in compliance with state laws. The specific requirements for licenses and permits may differ depending on the state. To determine the necessary licenses and permits for your LLC in its registered state, you can visit the SBA website. The application process for licenses and permits can be completed online.License types:Health inspection certificationAlarm permitSales tax registrationWeights and measures registrationUnemployment and worker's compensation registrationGeneral business licenseProfessional/occupational licensesHow to Obtain Business Licenses and Permits?To begin, select the state where you plan to operate your business, followed by the city and county. Then, navigate to the Small Business Administration's website and locate the relevant information pertaining to the regulations of your area. It’s important to have your Employer Identification Number (EIN) on hand, which can be obtained through the Internal Revenue Service's website. In addition, you will need to obtain your business code, which can be found on various websites offering this service. Make sure to check if any permits are required in addition to the business license. Finally, be prepared to pay the filing fee, which can range from $50 to $500, using a credit card.>> Try Out ZenBusiness >>Learn More About Tax RequirementsWhen starting an LLC, it’s highly recommended to hire an experienced accountant who has knowledge and expertise in managing LLCs. Additionally, educate yourself about tax laws related to your business structure. The type of taxation you will face depends on how you choose to structure your business, such as opting for Sole Proprietorship (for single-member LLCs), Partnership (for multi-member LLCs), or selecting an S-Corp status. These decisions are crucial for the success of your LLC.The role of accountants isn’t limited to ensuring compliance with tax laws and timely filing of returns; they can also help save a considerable amount of money through legal tax reduction techniques, which a general accountant with limited experience may not know. However, it’s possible to minimize the accounting bill by organizing the debit and credit records effectively.LLC Tax Filing TipsTo begin with, it’s important to identify and make use of any applicable tax credits or deductions that your LLC is eligible for. Secondly, it’s crucial to be aware of and note down the deadlines for business taxes well in advance, which can be done by consulting a calendar. Additionally, you have the option of engaging the services of a certified tax professional or accountant to handle your tax filings. Finally, it’s imperative to conduct thorough research and gain a clear understanding of your state's tax regulations, as the specific forms required to complete your LLC taxes will vary based on three factors.If your LLC has either one or more members It’s important to consider corporate tax status options if you choose the pass-through option Additionally, if your LLC has staff members, this should also be considered Get Business InsuranceIf you own a business, having insurance can be useful in safeguarding you from unexpected incidents, such as harm caused by water or fire, damage to your property or inventory, lateness in meeting a deadline, or unauthorized access to your client's information. Additionally, it can also provide coverage for everyday hazards like accidents involving employees, injuries caused by slip-and-fall, and business disruptions due to supply chain issues.

Fees for LLCs can be as low as under $100 in certain states, making it a suitable option for individuals who wish to create an LLC without incurring significant expenses.Tax-related benefits: Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) have the advantage of being considered pass-through entities, which allows them to be included in personal tax filings while keeping business assets separate from personal finances. This is a popular choice among LLC owners who want to avoid being taxed twice. However, LLCs can also be classified as sole proprietorships, partnerships, C-corporations, or S-corporations for tax purposes.Liability shielding: The term LLC stands for Limited Liability Company, which means that it protects both the members and owners from any potential liability. This protection is achieved by properly identifying and safeguarding the business's assets, which prevents the members' personal assets from being at risk in case the company becomes involved in a legal dispute.Starting an LLC can be a straightforward process with the help of available companies to assist with paperwork and annual obligations, like submitting annual reports. It’s not a complicated task to learn.Types of LLCs to ConsiderIf you're planning to open an LLC, it's important to be aware of the various types of LLCs that exist. This knowledge is crucial in deciding which business model is best suited for your company and its intended operations. The available LLC structures include:Single-member LLC: When you open an LLC that’s run and possessed by one individual. Although it resembles a sole proprietorship, it offers more advantages in terms of tax and protection against liability.Multi-member LLC: When you open an LLC that have multiple members is typically categorized as either manager-managed or member-managed entities, L3C: The term ""low-profit liability companies"" refers to entities that serve as a connection between nonprofit and for-profit LLCs. These entities prioritize the business's mission over profit.Series LLC: Series LLCs are business structures that consist of several tiers, where the highest level LLC owns a range of lower-level LLCs that are separated without any limits. Each LLC in the series operates independently, and their assets are kept separate from each other. PLLC: This type of business formation, known as a specialized LLC, is restricted to licensed professionals only and does not apply to all types of businesses.Restricted LLC: LLCs that have restrictions mentioned in their articles of organization are exempted from taxation for the initial 10 years after their formation. Additionally, such LLCs aren’t allowed to distribute profits to their members. It’s mandatory to declare such restrictions in the articles of organization.Uncommon: Anonymous LLCAn LLC is deemed ""anonymous"" when its owner isn’t publicly identified by the state, though there’s no legal designation for this type of entity. While you open an LLC, it’s typically a matter of public record. Some individuals may want to keep their information private for various reasons.For example, a single-member LLC owner who operates a business from their home may not want that information to be publicly known. Currently, only a few states, including Delaware, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming, allow it to open anonymously.>> Try Out ZenBusiness >>How to Start an LLC – Frequently Asked Questions Should I Get an LLC for My Small Business?The most widely used type of business entity is the Limited Liability Company due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of establishment.

Alternatively, you may choose to engage the services of LLC providers such as Swyft Filing or ZenBusiness to establish your company.

The expenses can range from $50 to $500, and if you choose to work with a third-party formation company, they may charge an additional fee of $40 to $350 for their services to open an LLC.Is it Possible to Set Up an LLC for Free?Registration fees for LLC formation differ from state to state, but every state requires a fee to be paid to open an LLC. Despite some companies promoting ""free"" LLC formation, this simply means that they will complete the paperwork on your behalf without charging a fee. However, you will still be required to pay the state filing fee to open an LLC.Bottom Line on How to Start an LLCIt's common to feel anxious about creating an LLC business, but with the information provided in this post, you can take the necessary steps.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Latin America (LatAm) may be distant from India but strengthening trade links means the region’s influence over financial markets is rising. The region is resource rich and exports large quantities of industrial raw materials and agricultural commodities. Any disruption to production, exports or shipments rattle commodity markets and in turn their industrial buyers and eventually consumers.Another source of risk is economic instability. Countries in this region tend to overspend, warranting regular bailouts. Politicians offering to fix the broken system are voted into the government. But once in power these very politicians struggle to deliver on bitter reforms. The cycle seems to be repeating now.“With a strengthening dollar and rising interest rates, LatAm is undergoing what Asia suffered in the 1997 SE Asian currency crisis. Servicing (paying interest) and repayment of dollar loans are becoming a Herculean task for LatAm nations,” writes Vijay L Bhambwani in today’s edition of his column. Do Read.Pushed to the wall, politicians and executive resort to desperate measures to raise revenues, such as fire sale of mining materials or impose punitive taxes. This can pose risk to metal stocks, warns Bhambwani. Metal stocks have been one of the relatively better performing sectors on the NSE in the last six months thanks to stable profit margins and recovery in business volumes.And metals is not the only sector whose fortunes are intertwined to the developments in Latin America. UPL, the largest crop protection products company by revenue, derives 41 percent of its revenue from Latin America. After what has been the most turbulent year (2023) for global agrochemicals industry in recent past, the recovery hopes are pinned on Latin America.“Owing to the differences in region-wise cropping calendars, Latin America is probably the key region to monitor during H2 FY24, as it begins its cropping season with high inventories in its distribution channel,” explain analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. UPL’s revenue dropped by 18 percent in H1 FY24. The company posted a loss in the September 2023 quarter.While excess inventories and price erosion are undermining the revenue of agrochemicals producers, hot weather and potential change in crop patterns are clouding the demand outlook.What both instances show is that LatAm can have an influential role on corporate earnings and in financial markets, and investors would do well to keep a close tab on the region.Investing insights from our research teamLIC – Will the rising market tide lift this underperformer?Concor Q2FY24: Is it the right time to add the stock?Aptus Value: Is it a good time to add this high-growth housing finance player?TrackerPro Economic Tracker | Auto sale races ahead, air traffic flies higherWhat else are we reading? Uranium is flying high on war and climate changeChart of the Day: Luxury housing props up affordability indexGold: the consequences of war are shock and Au (republished from the FT)MCA seeks to shine light on hidden owners of companies Winds of change as Telangana readies for pollsThe Eastern Window | China is seeking European alliances independent of the USCOP28: China is a rich country.

That could be the death knell for the deal since there won’t be enough time to tie all the loose ends by the formal Dec. 21 deadline, the people said.Zee is insisting that its Chief Executive Officer Punit Goenka — also its founder’s son — will helm the new entity, as agreed in the pact signed in 2021, while Sony is wary of his appointment given a regulatory probe against Goenka, the people added. This has created an eleventh-hour tussle in the two-year-old merger plan that has already seen a fair share of drama and delays.A Zee representative, without commenting on the leadership issue, said in an emailed response that the company was “actively engaged” toward the timely completion of all prerequisites for the deal. Zee had already completed most of them and was in touch with Sony “on a regular basis,” he said. Sony’s representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, alleged in June that the Mumbai-based media house faked the recovery of loans to cover private financing deals by its founder, Subhash Chandra. Chandra and his son, Goenka, “abused their position” and siphoned off funds, Sebi said in an interim order.While Goenka got a reprieve from an appellate authority against the Sebi order — it had barred him from being an executive or director position in a listed company — Sony still views the ongoing probe as an overhanging corporate governance issue, the people said. Local newspaper Mint first reported this impasse.Who Blinks FirstThe last-lap tussle is pushing the merger to the brink of collapse unless one of the partners blinks. The Sony-Zee deal sought to create India’s biggest entertainment company with the financial muscle to challenge global powerhouses, including Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., as well as local conglomerates such as Reliance Industries Ltd.Sony will own a 50.86% stake in the merged entity and Goenka’s family will own 3.99% if the deal goes through, with public shareholders in possession of the remaining stake, according to the 2021 agreement. Sony is not considering an extension of the Dec. 21 deadline, the people said.To be sure, the proposed merger has received almost all regulatory approvals and can still be closed if the two sides expeditiously resolve their issues. They can also request India’s company court for extending the merger deadline.If closed, the transaction will help expand Sony’s media business in the world’s most populous country, with over 75 television channels and a market share of 37%, ahead of Disney-owned Star’s 24%, according to a note from brokerage firm Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.Consolidation is already heating up in the sector with Reliance, which tried to buy out Zee earlier, in advanced talks to buyout Walt Disney Co.’s India operations, Bloomberg News reported last month."

Reliance Industries Ltd., Europe’s top supplier of Indian diesel, draws more than third of its crude from Russia, the figures show.The surge in diesel imports from India also illustrates a fundamental shift in oil trading in the wake of the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine. A year ago, Russia was Europe’s top supplier of diesel, a fuel vital to the industrial and transport sectors. The European Union banned most seaborne imports of Russian crude in December and oil products in February.In response, Europe and the UK have sought diesel supplies from other markets. India is helping to fill a supply gap as European imports from the US, Turkey and Saudi Arabia slip in November. Arrivals of Saudi diesel are set to drop to about 94,000 barrels a day, the lowest since February 2020.The “availability of Saudi barrels has fallen sharply in October and November due to planned local refinery maintenance, boosting interest for Indian diesel,” said Eugene Lindell, head of refined products at industry consultant Facts Global Energy.Competitive EdgeAs the West shuns Russian oil, Moscow has found increased appetite for its crude in Asia. Indian refiners have been able to purchase Russian crude at a discount and sell the processed oil in markets, like Europe, where diesel is in high demand.“The 1.6-1.8 million barrels a day of Russian crude that Indian refiners buy creates a competitive edge that others do not have,” according to Viktor Katona, lead crude analyst at Kpler.The share of Indian diesel flows to Asia now accounts for about 19% of the country’s total exports of the fuel, compared with 33% last year, he said. Much of that volume has been diverted to Europe. In total, Europe’s imports of diesel and gasoil this month are set to rise to 935,000 barrels a day, a 5% increase from October, Kpler data show."

India's Ola Electric feels the strains of success,"November 28, 2023 08:40 AM IST","Bhavish Aggarwal's Ola Electric, which he likens to Tesla in the West, is zipping towards a stock-market listing after going from zero to 338,000 e-scooter sales in about two years.","Bhavish Aggarwal, India's answer to Elon Musk, is racing to roll out millions of electric scooters and speed his nation to a cleaner future. Some of his mechanics can't keep up, though.Aggarwal's Ola Electric, which he likens to Tesla in the West, is zipping towards a stock-market listing after going from zero to 338,000 e-scooter sales in about two years. The tech entrepreneur vows to banish the internal combustion engine (ICE) from India, where two-wheel vehicles rule the roads.We will ""end the ICE age"", the 38-year-old told Reuters ahead of the launch of new Ola e-scooters starting at about $1,000 on Aug. 15, Indian Independence day. He said the company, already valued at $5.4 billion, would quadruple its annual production capacity to 2 million e-scooters by early new year.Yet Ola's rapid ride faces a few potholes.Parts of the company's nationwide network of over 400 service hubs which maintain and repair its EVs are showing signs of strain after the surge in sales, according to Reuters visits to 35 centres in 10 states between July and October, plus interviews with 36 Ola service staff and 40 customers.Staff at more than half of those centres, mainly sites in the big metropolitan areas of Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, said they had significant backlogs, with demand outstripping their workforce or their supply of spare parts, and repair waiting times ranging from three days to two weeks.At an Ola workshop in Thane, among the biggest of the 14 centres in the Mumbai region, more than 100 e-scooters awaiting repairs were visible outside in a clearing, many parked in a muddy clearing gathering dust and littered with bird droppings.Devendra Ghuge, a Thane service manager, told Reuters in late October that the number of cases the centre dealt with had risen from 200-300 to roughly 1,000 a month over the previous four months, with waiting times stretching up to two weeks.In January, Ola founder and CEO Aggarwal had pledged that customers would be able to bring their vehicles into a hub and receive same-day service in most cases.In the August interview, he said customers were ""voting with their wallets every month"" by snapping up Ola EVs. But he acknowledged service capacity issues and said Ola was ""aggressively"" bolstering its service network by adding 100 new centres and hiring more technicians.""We have the highest number of products on the market ... and we do have a scale-up required in our service network,"" he said.An Ola spokesperson said the Reuters reporting didn't accurately capture the scale and quality of the company's robust and growing service operations.Ravi Bhatia of auto consulting firm JATO Dynamics said a good service network was critical in India, the world's biggest two-wheeler market. Indians are new to tech-packed EVs that can be more sensitive to bumps and bashes than many conventional scooters and motorbikes, he added.India can indeed pose tough driving conditions, and two-wheelers are used by hundreds of millions of people to navigate roads that are often congested and riddled with potholes.Ola needs ""to build the infrastructure for service accordingly, otherwise word-of-mouth will bite them,"" Bhatia said.'TESLA FOR WEST, OLA FOR REST'Aggarwal often declares, ""Tesla is for the West, Ola for the rest"", and he's a man in a hurry.He says all new scooters and motorbikes sold in India could be electric by the end of 2025, a goal way ahead of the government's target of 70% of new two-wheeler sales being EVs by 2030.Two years since Ola's first e-scooter rolled off the line, the startup has established itself as the leader in India's two-wheeler EV market, with about a third of sales by volume. It has attracted marquee investors including Japan's SoftBank and Singapore's Temasek and is gearing up for a $700 million Indian IPO.Industry data shows sales of e-scooters nearly tripled to over 700,000 in the year to March versus the previous year, thanks to Ola and also rivals like Hero Electric and TVS Motor.Yet those sales were still a fraction of the 5.2 million new scooters and 10.2 million motorbikes sold in India, where EV adoption significantly lags countries like the U.S. and China, and charging infrastructure is in its infancy.HOW TO RIDE E-SCOOTERSGhuge, the manager at Ola's Thane workshop, said reported service issues included battery drainages, software glitches and damaged wires. He put much of the service surge down to the fact Indians were inexperienced in driving e-scooters on the country's often poorly maintained roads, adding that many vehicles had been damaged after slipping on roads during monsoon season.""Electric vehicles are new to people so they aren't aware of how to ride the vehicle to maximise optimal output,"" he said.Customer Khubeb Koradia, 25, said the Thane centre took three weeks to fix software-related issues after his EV broke down in September. The workshop ""looked like a scooter graveyard"" he said, referring to the scores of vehicles parked outside.At the Ola centre in the city of Kochi, service manager Ronald Radhakrishnan told Reuters in August that its 17 staff were ""unable to handle demand for repairs"". Dozens of vehicles were parked outside the workshop, with some also in an area being used to park scooters across the road.'GONE THROUGH THE ROOF'Some customers have found it tough to book a repair slot.Koradia shared a video with Reuters showing his attempt to book a slot on Oct. 31 for an e-scooter overheating problem. Seven of the nearest eight service centres to him in Mumbai rejected his request for repairs with the same message: ""All slots for this location are full for the next few days.""Hundreds of other Ola customers have also complained online about repair times or difficulties in finding servicing slots, according to a review of social media posts.Aggarwal is bullish about his business, though, saying last month his sales had ""gone through the roof"" in India's festive season, with an e-scooter being sold every 10 seconds.During his Reuters interview, he dismissed much of the online outcry on service issues as ""mudslinging"" by rivals, without elaborating. ""A lot of what you hear and see need not actually be the truth,"" he said."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-drug-manufacturers-benefit-from-big-pharma-interest-beyond-china-11814731.html,Indian drug manufacturers benefit from Big Pharma interest beyond China,"November 27, 2023 11:55 AM IST",China has for nearly 20 years been the preferred location for a range of pharmaceutical research and manufacturing services due to the low cost and speed offered by contract drugmakers there.,"Drugmakers are seeking to limit their reliance on Chinese contractors who produce drugs used in clinical trials and early-stage manufacturing, a move that is benefiting rivals in India, according to interviews with 10 industry executives and experts.China has for nearly 20 years been the preferred location for a range of pharmaceutical research and manufacturing services due to the low cost and speed offered by contract drugmakers there.That relationship largely held firm despite a U.S.-China trade war under the Trump administration and supply chain havoc experienced by other industries during the COVID-19 pandemic. But increasing tensions with China have prompted more Western governments to recommend that companies ""de-risk"" supply chains from exposure to the Asian superpower.That is leading some biotech companies to consider using manufacturers in India to produce active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for clinical trials or other outsourced work.""Today you're probably not sending an RFP (request for proposal) to a Chinese company,"" said Tommy Erdei, global co-head of healthcare investment banking at Jefferies. ""It's like, 'I don't want to know, it doesn't matter if they can do it for cheaper, I'm not going to start putting my product into China'.""Dr Ashish Nimgaonkar, the founder of Glyscend Therapeutics, a U.S.-based biotech firm testing treatments for type 2 diabetes and obesity in early trials, agreed. ""All of the factors over the past several years have made China a less attractive option for us,"" he said.Nimgaonkar told Reuters that when Glyscend issues an RFP later in the development stage of the medicines it has in trials, Indian contract development and manufacturing organisations (CDMOs) would be preferred over Chinese ones.Four of India's largest CDMOs - Syngene, Aragen Life Sciences, Piramal Pharma Solutions, and Sai Life Sciences - told Reuters they have this year seen increased interest and requests from Western pharma companies, including major multinationals.Sai declined to comment on profit growth but said sales have grown 25%-30% in recent years. The other companies said they reported strong profit growth in the most recent quarter.Top executives at the firms said some customers want to add India as a second source, in addition to China, for manufacturing. Others are seeking to leave China and even making requests to originate supply chains in India.The full benefit for these Indian manufacturers will not be immediate, said Peter DeYoung, CEO of Piramal Pharma Solutions.It will take time for treatments in early development to make it to the market, when contracts would become more lucrative for outsourcing firms like his, he said.Chinese CDMOs are established makers of biologic drugs, which require a higher threshold of regulatory approval than conventional medicines, said Helen Chen, Greater China Managing Partner at L.E.K. Consulting in Shanghai.Hiring a new firm for complex work such as biologic manufacturing can take three to five years, she added. ""It's really not something that (companies) just pick up and move like shoes.""STRONG GROWTHIndia is seeking a bigger foothold in the pharma services sector to boost sales and reputation for its $42 billion pharmaceuticals industry.But concerns over lax oversight persist. Nimgaonkar said Indian CDMOs need to do more to ensure their reputation on quality standards matches Western and Chinese ones.In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned against using an eye drop made in India linked to the outbreak of a drug-resistant bacteria in the United States that caused one death.India-based research firm Mordor Intelligence estimates revenue from India's CDMO industry at $15.6 billion this year compared to $27.1 billion in China. But it estimates revenues from India's industry will grow, on average, at more than 11% annually over the next five years, compared to about 9.6% for China.The Indian CDMOs told Reuters that their facilities are routinely inspected by the FDA. An FDA spokesperson declined to comment.Piramal Pharma has this year received requests from clients for ""backward integration to India"", which means that even the most basic raw materials are sourced from the country instead of China, said DeYoung. Piramal buys about 15% of its raw materials from China but is trying to reduce that.Sai Life Sciences said it almost doubled manufacturing capacity since 2019 and is adding another 25% in the next year or so to meet demand.Ramesh Subramanian, chief commercial officer of Aragen, a privately-owned Indian firm that has grown from 2,500 to 4,500 employees in the past five years, said revenue growth of 21% last year was partly driven by new contracts with Western biotech firms. Aragen counts seven of the 10 biggest pharma companies as clients, he said, declining to name them.The shift is particularly evident in drug discovery work for conventional pharmaceuticals.""New biotechs are deciding to put eggs in both the Indian and China baskets from the start,"" Subramanian said."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/smoke-mirrors-and-a-chimera-of-promoter-guarantees-11777401.html,"Smoke, mirrors, and a chimera of promoter guarantees","November 21, 2023 05:44 PM IST","Promoter’s personal guarantee first arose as an additional security for industrial loans made by banks and institutions in response to syphoning off funds and falsification of accounts by promoters. But over the years, it became a joke and now banks are putting in place stringent recovery systems","It was a pleasant winter morning in Hyderabad, and a young banker at a development financial institution had just finished preparing the documentation for a loan.It was his first industrial loan, for the capacity expansion of a well-known pharmaceutical unit. He had gone to great lengths to ensure that his analysis of the project, its prospects, and the company's ability to repay were of the highest quality.His detailed appraisal, which included researching the product, its global markets and competition, identifying risks, and suggesting mitigation and security measures to better secure the loan, had earned him praise from his bosses.He had requested that the company and its promoters come by that day to go over and sign the documents, so that the loan could be disbursed, and the appointment was set for 11 am.By 10.45 am, the paperwork was ready, neatly stacked in the office conference room, ready for signing, with coffee/tea on hand. At 11 am, the promoter of the company, nattily dressed in white sports T-shirt and shorts, walked into the office.He was on his way to the club for a game of tennis when he stopped by to sign the loan documents. Without further ado, he signed the lengthy documents. The befuddled banker inquired whether he, his lawyers, or corporate secretarial staff would like to read the documentation first, given the stringent conditions, which included the promoters' personal guarantees.Promoter Teaches A Lesson About LoansThe promoter laughed, amused by the idea. He responded that the loan had only two components, the first of which was when the company pursued the lender for the loan. The second was when the lender pursued the company for repayment. The paperwork and legalese were irrelevant to the entire process. It was a lesson in lending realpolitik that the young banker would never forget.That story dates back to 1999. But the promoters' long-held faith in India's tortuous, manipulated, and failed loan recovery mechanisms was not misplaced. Generations of bankers have watched helplessly as companies and promoters made a mockery of contractual loan commitments, even as the fungibility of corporate and personal wealth, as well as poor law enforcement and adjudication, ensured that company promoters personally prospered, regardless of the health of the companies they managed, and often at their expense.That Steel Magnate Is Not AloneIn many cases, the two were inversely related.  Stories like a steel magnate from Kolkata lavishly spending €50 million on his daughter's wedding in Barcelona while his company defaulted on workers' EPFO dues are common. And personal guarantees have not been worth the paper they were written on.A recent decision by the Supreme Court of India, which dismissed over 200 petitions challenging the legality of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) provisions on personal guarantors, has upheld long-overdue accountability for contractual rights and the end use of public funds.The case also shows how India's command-and-control economy, which was implemented as government policy for decades, gradually warped the fundamental principles required to build a strong financial system based on transparency and trust.A Beast Called Promoter’s Personal GuaranteeThe promoter’s personal guarantee first arose as an additional security for industrial loans made by banks and institutions in response to widespread abuse of siphoning funds and falsifying accounts by promoters while running a company.It was then pithily observed that while there were many sick companies, it was hard to find financially sick promoters. However, instead of addressing the underlying issues of financial transparency and accountability, law enforcement, and timely adjudication, governments simply allowed banks and institutions under its control to seek personal guarantees from promoters.The hollowness of this fig-leaf response was enough to save the government's moral face. However, its pious-in-intention but rotten-in-practice patronage system ensured that the system remained unresponsive even as more meaningless documentation was added to loans with no hope of enforcement. And promoters continued to sign documents cheerfully, with no regard for repayment or accountability.The sham practice reached its apex when personal guarantees from a single promoter were obtained for loans worth nearly Rs 25,000 crore – without the bank or institution raising any concern about the promoters' ability to honour the personal guarantee.Crucial Questions ForgottenBanks forgot questions like these: Is that level of promoter net worth, or could legitimately be, attained without siphoning off funds from the company? And, if it believed funds could or would be siphoned off and had doubts about promoter intent, should it make the loan at all, and, if so, how did the personal guarantee add to the loan's security?This form-over-substance approach to lending has long plagued India's financial system, leading to the non- performing asset (NPA) banking crisis of the 2010s.The recent Supreme Court decision has also rekindled old debates. Promoters, as in the past, claim that this will have a ""chilling effect"" on the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship, stifling borrowings and capital investment growth. Others have argued that having the right principles as the foundation for building a strong financial system is more important.As India's financial markets mature and state-directed lending fades into obscurity, the latter argument gains weight and promise.  Money is a commodity that lenders must lend, based on their risk perception and underwriting skills. Any security provided must increase the lender's confidence in the loan's repayment. If promoter guarantees continue to be unenforceable in the system, they provide no additional comfort.In contrast, if they do become enforceable, they provide additional security that promoters can offer to lenders. Concerning the ""chilling effect,"" it is not as if there are no promoters in the Indian corporate ecosystem who are unable to borrow without providing a promoter guarantee. In fact, some companies are so creditworthy as to borrow at rates lower than sovereign debt on international markets. This argument is frequently advanced by those seeking to borrow more than the market's assessment of their ability to repay, in an effort to maintain the old system of crony banking and patronage, which results in the same old NPA crises cleaned up with public funds. Not any longer. Of course, there will be loan defaults in the future, but hopefully with transparency, accountability, and recovery rather than gaming the system.The Way OutConcerning legacy promoter guarantees, simply proceeding under the IBC would not suffice. Declaring personal bankruptcy after transferring all assets into family or benami accounts would be the simplest thing to do.Lenders must step up their efforts to follow the money trail, trace fund syphoning, and bring it before the courts. There is ample forensic expertise and intelligence available on the market. The more important question is whether they intend to do so. Lenders have traditionally prioritised new business over recoveries for obvious reasons.As a result, the expected rigour of recovery processes, whether internal or external, has been diluted.  Low recovery rates, however, not only cause lender losses, but they also distort market efficiencies and incentivise delinquent behaviour. In order for loan markets to be efficient, recovery markets must also improve their efficiency. Sending the right message through effective personal promoter guarantee enforcement would be a step in the right direction.Sandeep Hasurkar is an ex-investment banker and author of `Never Too Big To Fail: The Collapse of IL&FS’.

In the ongoing discourse, the predominant focus has revolved around simplifying the process of initiating a business.Considerable efforts have already been undertaken to improve the Ease of Doing Business (EODB) and streamline business establishment procedures. Though many still complain, things have been better than before. What has not been addressed squarely is the ease of running a business, or as some call it cost of running a business.The government's determination to revitalise the business environment in the country is evident from its robust political resolve and efforts to eliminate obstacles hindering business operations. This is evident through the recently introduced Jan Vishwas Bill, which aims to remove criminal penalties associated with 183 provisions found within 42 Central Acts.There is no doubt that the fundamental pillars of enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in business operations lie in reducing unwarranted delays, improving the formulation of laws, and enforcing accountability. However, we come across various cases in our States where guilty officers are not punished adequately by the enforcement system which includes both the bureaucracy and the judiciary. Judicial delays due to the adjournment pandemic are par for the course. Indeed, there is a governance deficit in many cases. Regrettably, India has claimed the unenviable top position in Asia for having the highest number of reported bribery cases.Furthermore, the absence of sufficient deterrence and/or accountability has a detrimental impact on businesses, impeding their effective and smooth operation. It doesn’t matter whether the enterprise could get over the starting problems when it is unable to navigate through the maze of inspectors, while the insensitive bureaucracy and judiciary only make it worse.The ReformsBut let's get real here — it's time for the next blitz of changes, and that means making sure those policymakers really step up their game and do an even better job of making it easier for enterprises to run a business by ensuring accountability and transparency. The next wave of reforms to remove structural bottlenecks must shift its attention towards creating an environment of swift inquiries and prosecution. Furthermore, by creating a bonus-malus provision for all supervisory ranks to ensure that they act against the negative, non-performing and corrupt officers and judges so that it becomes easier for businesses to operate and citizens to live. This is not to say that all enterprises work in an honest manner. Such entrepreneurs should be hauled up and denied all facilities so that they become examples for others to look down upon.The courts are of significant importance in this whole ecosystem. They should make sure that business-related cases are managed well and get resolved quickly. States should expedite fast track commercial courts and benches in high courts, which should not only help resolve commercial disputes speedily but also punish shady business operators. This will make the judiciary, bureaucracy and business more aware of their actions and responsibilities, and hopefully stop them from doing illegal things.The fundamental principles of accountability and deterrence must be instilled within unscrupulous bureaucrats and judges. This necessitates the implementation of punctual and ongoing performance assessments, as well as the establishment of robust oversight mechanisms. Furthermore, it is imperative to insulate bureaucrats and judges from political interference to enable them to operate with unwavering dedication and expertise, thereby fostering a business environment conducive to the nation's welfare.Leveraging TechTechnology can be a big deal as it streamlines business operations, acting as a bridge between service providers and users, reducing paperwork and bureaucratic delays. It also promotes cross-sector collaboration for knowledge sharing, accountability, and transparency.Prior to the enactment of any business-related laws, the government ought to engage in public consultations, providing clear reasons for regulations, and conducting Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs). The participation of industry and citizen stakeholders, particularly victims, is crucial to ensuring accountability and upholding the principles of the rule of law.Systemic corruption exists like termites in our administration and courts. Nothing moves without paying a fixed ‘fee’. Clearly, there is a need to curb this malafide system. Good examples exist, such as in the passport system. Efforts to do similarly for land building registration systems are being made in our states.We also need to sort out the problem of shutting down a business, especially when companies want to close voluntarily. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) revamped the process of liquidating companies, but it's not just bankruptcy; owners often shut solvent companies for personal, tech, or regulatory reasons. The Economic Survey (2020-21) and (2021-22) highlighted the lengthy process of voluntary liquidation in India.One very big problem that we have in India is judicial delays as well as bad orders. These have to be addressed by the judiciary to set its house in order. We have been discussing this forever, and the cows have already come home waiting for their chow.Progressive efforts to improve the business environment have been made, but it's vital to maintain checks and balances to support a strong manufacturing foundation and smooth business operations. Achieving this necessitates collaboration between authorities, judiciary and active stakeholder involvement, aligning with participatory development principles. This is an imperative if we wish to pursue the aspiration of becoming a $30 trillion economy by 2047.The writers work for CUTS International, a global public policy research and advocacy group.

She didn’t identify the Indian bank.Fraser touted Citigroup’s clients in 160 countries and jurisdictions and emphasized their dependence on trade and supply chains, noting that “geopolitical and macroeconomic shocks that we’ve had of late” have made it harder to source and move manufactured goods. Her New York-based bank recently helped finance an auto-parts plant in Guanajuato, Mexico, for a Korean firm, and is working with electric-vehicle makers to open factories and stores in Thailand, she said.“It should come as no surprise that Citi is a strong advocate for a world that continues to collaborate across borders and engage,” Fraser said. “True resilience, it comes from open markets, it comes from robust and diversified supply chains. So a decoupling of the world’s dominant economies is neither possible nor is it prudent.”This year’s APEC conference has been the focus of global attention, with Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping using the event for their first meeting in a year in a bid to ease US-China tensions that have threatened economic growth worldwide. Later Wednesday, Xi had dinner with US business leaders including Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook and BlackRock Inc.’s Larry Fink.A month ago, Fraser initiated the biggest restructuring of Citigroup in two decades as she seeks to simplify the firm and boost returns. The bank intends to cut back to eight layers from 13 as part of the work. Fraser has said Citigroup is doing away with as many co-heads as possible to ensure there are “single points of accountability” across the firm.With the moves, Citigroup is abandoning its two core operating units and instead focusing on five key businesses: trading, banking, services, wealth management and US consumer offerings. Fraser also is weighing whether to shutter the firm’s municipal-bond trading and origination business, which for decades was a powerhouse in the $4 trillion market for US state and local debt, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month, citing people familiar with the matter."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-seeks-to-restart-stalled-adani-coal-imports-probe-11759391.html,India seeks to restart stalled Adani coal imports probe,"November 17, 2023 09:48 AM IST",The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence since 2016 has been trying to procure transaction documents related to Adani's dealings from Singapore authorities.,"Indian investigators are seeking to restart a probe into Adani Group for alleged overvaluation of coal imports and have asked the Supreme Court to allow them to collect evidence from Singapore, a step they say the company thwarted for years, legal documents show.The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence since 2016 has been trying to procure transaction documents related to Adani's dealings from Singapore authorities. The agency suspects many of the group's coal shipments imported from Indonesian suppliers were first billed at higher prices on paper to its Singapore unit, Adani Global Pte, and then to its Indian arms.Adani Enterprises and its subsidiaries, led by billionaire Gautam Adani, have successfully mounted repeated legal challenges in India and Singapore to block the documents' release, court papers show. Adani has denied wrongdoing, saying that Indian authorities assessed its coal shipments before releasing them from ports.In an Oct. 9 legal filing, which Reuters is reporting for the first time, the revenue intelligence agency asked India's Supreme Court to quash a previous lower court order that allowed Adani to block authorities from collecting evidence from Singapore.The Indian officials dispute Adani's arguments that the agency did not follow ""due process"", saying in the filing it had approval to seek information from the Southeast Asian city-state under a mutual legal assistance treaty.""Permission for following this route was obtained from the Ministry of Finance as well as (the) Ministry of Home Affairs,"" the 25-page filing states, adding that the investigation ""is completely in compliance"".In a statement to Reuters, Adani Group said it had ""fully co-operated"" with the authorities by providing details and documents sought more than four years ago and that ""no deficiency or objection"" was communicated by investigators thereafter.The Indian revenue agency did not respond to Reuters' queries.The effort to revive the coal probe comes amid wider regulatory scrutiny of Adani since Hindenburg Research in January accused the tycoon and his conglomerate of improper use of tax havens and stock manipulation.Despite Adani's denials, the short seller's report triggered a $150 billion plunge in the group's stocks. India's Supreme Court is also overseeing the market regulator's probe of Hindenburg's allegations.Amid the fallout and ahead of India's 2024 election, political opponents have increased pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration, accusing it of favouritism toward Adani in government decisions.Modi and Adani, who both hail from Gujarat, have denied impropriety.The revenue agency began looking into Adani's imports as part of a broader investigation into 40 companies that started in 2014. Investigators alleged the companies importing Indonesian coal were overinvoicing deliveries by showing bills of shipments routed through intermediaries in Singapore and elsewhere.Indian authorities reviewed 1,300 shipments involving Adani and alleged in court filings that it ""grossly overstated"" or ""artificially inflated the import value of coal"" as compared with the export value from Indonesia, ""with the objective of siphoning off"" funds to tax havens and charging higher power prices in India.The sums involved may run into billions of rupees, according to the agency, which has not identified any Indonesian supplier.BATTLE IN SINGAPOREThe evidence India is seeking from Singapore authorities, which includes transaction documents from 20 of Adani's banks there, could help establish a financial trail in the case, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.If India's Supreme Court allows the agency's latest request, it would then need to seek an order from Singapore's Court of Appeal to release the material.The Singapore court declined requests from Reuters last month to inspect related case documents, saying in written responses that the files were sealed.But a Reuters review of hundreds of pages of Indian court filings and orders reveal a tussle between India and Adani that stretched from Mumbai to New Delhi to Singapore in recent years.In 2019, on Adani's challenge, the High Court of Mumbai cited procedural lapses in quashing the request by Indian investigators to collect evidence against Adani.Days later, the agency appealed to the Supreme Court, which put the Mumbai verdict on hold ""until further orders"", which the agency contended in a subsequent Supreme Court filing meant ""the investigation could be continued"".But the Singapore court in late 2020, after Adani's request, said the documents should not be released for now because India's top court had not reached a final decision, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter and a Reuters review of legal orders.In a statement to Reuters, the office of Singapore Attorney-General Lucien Wong said the Singapore court had not opined on the merits of Adani's appeals and the case was still pending.The stance adopted by Adani's companies in Singapore ""created impediments"" and the investigation ""remains stalled"", the revenue agency told India's Supreme Court in 2021 filings.The case was not heard for around two years, until the agency told the Supreme Court in July that it wanted to update judges about certain events in Singapore, without elaborating. It then lodged its October filing in a fresh bid to obtain evidence.The next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 6."

The standalone core operating margin of the company has increased by 8 per cent in the first half of this fiscal to Rs 285 crore from Rs 234.85 crore in the same period a year ago.PTC India Ltd, a government of India initiative, is the pioneer in starting a power market in India. The company has maintained its leadership position in power trading since its inception.The trading activities involve long-term trading of power generated from large power projects including renewables as well as short-term trading arising as a result of supply and demand mismatches."

He said the diversified grouping, which has interests in the automotive and tech businesses, looks at scale when looking at a new business and prefers not to be in a business at all if it cannot do anything on a large scale.With the renewables business, the capital was a ""problem"" because of the consumption of resources and also piling up of debt. Shah said the company has a clear plan for the business now, and will be aiming to grow the same going ahead.As per the group's website, the renewables business has a capacity of 1.55 GW. Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board had last year announced to buy a 30 per cent stake in Mahindra Susten Private Limited at an equity value of Rs 2,371 crore and also proposed to set up the Invit as part of the same transaction.Meanwhile, Shah said India has made its place of leadership well known on the world stage and pointed out that strong governance and vibrant capital markets are a necessity for every leadership nation."

Spokespeople from India’s heavy industries and commerce ministries did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.In 2021, the Austin-based EV manufacturer had sought duty cuts on import of electric vehicles. It was hoping to have the rates reduced to 40% from the current range of 70%-100% for its vehicles, depending on their import value.Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk is likely to meet Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal later this week to discuss the company’s plans to set up a factory in the South Asian nation. Goyal is in San Francisco to attend the ministerial engagements of Indo-Pacific Economic Framework and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.Tesla is seeking to break into one of the world’s most promising auto markets where the demand for electric vehicles is rising among the country’s burgeoning middle class. For India, Tesla’s investment would aid the government’s push to increase the share of manufacturing in the nation’s GDP while also creating jobs.India’s electric car market is currently at a nascent stage with EVs accounting for just 1.3% of the total passenger vehicles sold last year, according to BloombergNEF. The adoption of EVs in the country has been held back by the high cost of cars, a dearth of options and lack of charging stations.Opening up the EV segment could speed up the adoption of cleaner transport in a country that currently has the world’s most toxic air. The government launched a $3.1 billion incentive program in 2021 to boost local EV production.Separately, India is also considering reducing import taxes on some electric vehicles from the UK as part of negotiations with Britain over a free-trade deal."

The festive season which is coming in, should augur very well for us going forward in the future.

I think it will take another three-four quarters... before rural comes at par with urban"". However, he added that the urban market is also driven by new-age channels such as modern trade and e-commerce, which are contributing around 20-25 per cent of the FMCG business.""So they are growing much ahead. For the rural, which is mainly GT (general trade as Kirana), to grow at that percentage is very difficult because the rural market has a large base and for a large base to grow at that percentage is difficult. So urban, I think for some time it is going to drive the growth,"" he said. Rural has a major population and almost 70 per cent of the total consumer base is from those regions, Malhotra added.Pre-COVID, rural was growing ahead of urban, driving the growth in the FMCG sector, while urban was lagging behind, he added. ""Now, we are seeing gradual slow volume recovery happening in the rural market... if I look at the last quarter, we see rural growth of around 6.7 per cent urban growth overall 11.2 per cent.""So, while the gap between urban and rural is narrowing, the gap is still there. Rural is still lagging urban but I think in due course of time as we lap over the lower bases rural recovery will continue to happen,"" he said.Rural markets generally contribute around 35 per cent of the FMCG industry and had shown positive growth in consumption during the March quarter this year, after a gap of six straight quarters, according to a report from data analytics firm Nielsen IQ.Dabur as per its strategy is looking at both urban and rural markets, which are expanding with the launch of more premium products, as average disposable income in India is increasing.In the urban market, where expansion is driven by e-commerce, modern trade channels, and expansion of mini metro and class one town, it is focusing on premiumisation with large pack sizes, while in the rural, it is targeting the aspirational buyers with low units price packs, Malhotra added.""We get the best of both worlds,"" he said adding ""While in the rural areas, we go with the price points which are more accessible and the urban level we are premiumising.""Now, 85 per cent of the country's population is a consuming class, which includes the top and bottom of the pyramids. The aspirations between the urban and rural markets are becoming common with the growth of social media and smartphone availability.Moreover, it is also trying to introduce some new brands in the premium category and also to relate with the millennials."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-start-oil-production-from-5-billion-deep-water-project-this-month-11732581.html,ONGC to start oil production from $5 billion deep-water project this month,"November 13, 2023 11:13 AM IST","""We plan to start producing from the Cluster-2 project in KG-DWN-98/2 block this month and slowly ramp up,"" ONGC Director (Production) Pankaj Kumar told PTI here.","State-controlled Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will kick off oil production from its much-delayed flagship deepsea project in Krishna Godavari basin in Bay of Bengal this month, helping reverse years of decline in output, a senior company official said.""We plan to start producing from the Cluster-2 project in KG-DWN-98/2 block this month and slowly ramp up,"" ONGC Director (Production) Pankaj Kumar told PTI here.A floating production unit, called FPSO, which will be used to produce oil, is already in the block. After several missed deadlines, ONGC has told Shapoorji Pallonji Oil & Gas (SPOG) that its floating production, storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) Armada Sterling-V should prepare to receive the first oil this month.Oil production from Cluster-2 should have begun by November 2021, but was delayed because of the pandemic.Kumar said ONGC plans to start producing from 3 to 4 wells initially and slowly connect others. ""Initial production could be 8,000 to 9,000 barrels per day."" KG deepsea is treacherous terrain and ONGC is mindful of not repeating mistakes of neighbouring KG-D6 block of Reliance Industries.While gas production is not so complex in the area, sand and water ingress in wells may happen if oil valves are opened too fast. The trick is to drill more wells and produce at the optimal quantities, not rushing in to produce bigger volumes, an official explained.Kumar said ONGC will ship the first consignment of crude oil to subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).The crude will be tested and yields will determine its grade and pricing, he said.ONGC has hired Armada Sterling-V, owned 70 per cent by SPOG and 30 per cent by Malaysia's Bumi Armada, for producing oil from below seabed.The FPSO has been waiting to receive oil since January 2, 2023, after she was hooked up on December 27, 2022. ONGC previously set May 2023, as the first Cluster-2 oil deadline, extended to August 2023, September 2023, and finally, October 2023.""These are extremely complex reservoirs and we need to be sure about everything before we start production,"" Kumar said.The five M field wells, identified for the initial oil flow, sit in water depths of about 400 meters. Flexible hoses will connect the M field wells to the FPSO. Later, the A and P1 oilfield wells will be connected.In all, 13 wells yielding oil and oil with associated gas will eventually be connected to Armada Sterling-V. Peak oil of 45,000 barrels per day is expected sometime in 2024-25. At peak, a tanker will berth alongside FPSO every two weeks to transport oil to a refinery where it will be turned into fuels like petrol and diesel.Kumar said some 2 mmscmd of gas would also flow with oil but actual gas output will start in May 2024, when 7-8 mmscmd production is expected.For that to happen, contractor McDermott needs to install the much-delayed Control and Process Platform (CPP) with Living Quarters and Upstream Platform (LQUP), which Malaysia's Sapura ENergy is manufacturing.The giant structure is ready to sail from Malaysia and should be in Indian waters early next year. Gas production would start in the middle of 2024.The production estimates are, however, much lower than what was originally projected. When the project was conceived in April 2018, ONGC had said the estimated capital expenditure would be USD 5.07 billion and operational expenditure would be USD 5.12 billion over a field life of 16 years.Kumar said the company hopes to arrest the decline in crude oil production in the next fiscal, while natural gas output is likely to see a rise.ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block in the KG basin, has a number of discoveries that have been clubbed into clusters.It is situated offshore the Godavari river delta in the Bay of Bengal. It is located 35-km off the coast of Andhra Pradesh in water depths ranging from 300-3,200 metres. The discoveries in the block are divided into three clusters -- Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.The Cluster 2 field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years.Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life. But now the output estimate is lower - 45,000 bpd of oil and up to 2.5 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and around 9 mmscmd from Cluster 2B."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adani-plots-expansion-of-overseas-port-empire-after-us-funding-11730861.html,Adani plots expansion of overseas port empire after US funding,"November 13, 2023 09:55 AM IST",The announcement marked a welcome reprieve for India’s Adani Group following a damaging short-seller attack and a number of corporate fraud allegations leveled against it this year.,"Standing before Sri Lankan officials and US diplomats in a five-star hotel in Colombo last week, Karan Adani boasted that a newly inked $553 million US government financing deal toward a port terminal being developed by his family’s conglomerate was a “reaffirmation by the international community.”The announcement marked a welcome reprieve for India’s Adani Group following a damaging short-seller attack and a number of corporate fraud allegations leveled against it this year. It also signaled Washington’s endorsement for the port empire owned by Karan’s father and billionaire Gautam Adani — seen as a close ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi — that would help curb China’s maritime influence in the Indian ocean.Those waters account for more than one-third of the world’s bulk cargo traffic and two-thirds of oil shipments. Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management Co. in Mumbai, called Adani’s port ambitions a “strategic” play, assisting India to counter China’s own string of ports in its backyard, stretching from Sri Lanka to Pakistan.Now Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd., seen as the conglomerate’s crown jewel, is eyeing further “opportunities in our neighboring countries,” Karan Adani, the operator’s chief executive officer, told Bloomberg News in the Sri Lankan capital. Those include potential ventures in Bangladesh, as well as East African and Southeast Asian nations, including Tanzania and Vietnam, adding to its existing Sri Lanka and Israel developments, he said.In a world that’s “looking beyond China — it is indeed a Chinese-styled expansion by Adani,” said Sanjiv Bhasin, director at Mumbai-based IIFL Securities Ltd.‘Long Game’The US funding for the Adani-led West Container Terminal in Colombo via the Intentional Development Finance Corp. was a shot-in-the-arm after a torrid few years for the Adani Group’s overseas expansion efforts.The conglomerate pulled the plug on its plans to build a port in Myanmar following a military coup. Last year, Adani faced protests and political criticism in Sri Lanka, which characterized the firm’s port and energy proposals as opaque projects pushed onto the country by New Delhi. India’s main opposition party has said Modi uses the country’s diplomatic service to advance the tycoon’s interests — allegations the government and Adani deny.But while Adani Ports is India’s largest operator — with a collection of 14 domestic terminals that can handle 600 million metric tons of capacity — it remains a relative minnow overseas. It’ll need to scale up manifold before challenging China’s wide sphere of influence, which is built on investments in more than 90 ports outside its borders, 13 of which have majority Chinese ownership, according to the US Council on Foreign Relations.“Given that Beijing is so far out front, it’s hard for Adani or anyone else to hold a candle to China’s infrastructure investments anytime in the foreseeable future,” said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington. “But Adani and his companies are playing a long game. They’re looking to slowly but consistently build out new investments in South Asia and beyond.”India FocusGautam Adani has openly criticized China in the past, but the conglomerate’s focus is still firmly anchored at home, where the billionaire is seen to have nurtured a long-standing friendship with Modi, publicly tying his business plans to the government’s economic objectives.Adani Ports’ domestic business accounts for about 90% of the firm’s revenues, Karan Adani said, adding that “this will remain as we are expanding in India.” A new Adani transshipment terminal in the southern state of Kerala was inaugurated last month, aiming to grab a bigger slice of international cargo.“Trade is booming, we are just doing a catch up game,” he added. “We are always short of capacity and that is hurting Indian trade.”His comments follow Modi’s outline in September for an Indian-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, part of which may run through Adani’s port in Israel’s Haifa. They also hint that the group is looking to head into a new expansionary phrase after paring back some plans to reassure investors following Hindenburg Research’s January broadside.Despite the US government loan package and recent investment from the likes of TotalEnergies SE in Adani’s green energy business, it’s premature to say “the floodgates of international finance will open for the Adani Group” as increased scrutiny on the conglomerate’s business practices remain, said Samantha Custer, director of policy analysis at AidData at William & Mary’s Global Research Institute.In August, Adani Port’s auditor Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP resigned after it couldn’t determine if the business was fully compliant with local laws, flagging concerns over transactions between Adani Ports and three entities that Adani said were unrelated parties. The reasons for Deloitte’s resignation “were not convincing,” the chairman of the company’s audit committee said at the time.Read more: Adani Ports Names MSKA as Auditor After Deloitte ResignsWith global markets and financing conditions remaining tight, Adani Ports may also “face the challenge of raising funds to fuel expansion as the cost of the debt is going to be high,” said Bhasin at IIFL Securities.‘Reputational Risks’Shares in Adani Ports fell 1.5% on Thursday after it posted a 4% year-on-year rise in quarterly net income to 17.48 billion rupees ($210 million), missing average analyst estimates. But the firm’s “resilient growth capability is visible if a 4.55 billion-rupee accounting write-off from the adoption of a new tax regime is discarded,” Denise Wong, an analyst at Blomberg Intelligence, wrote.Sanford C. Bernstein analysts Nikhil Nigania and Anusha Madireddy in a report published on Friday also pointed to “strong” quarterly volume growth up 17% from the same quarter last year, with gross debt falling to 472 billion rupees from 498 billion rupees at the end of March. They said that actions taken to curb leverage in the wake of Hindenburg’s attack “could be a blessing in disguise.”“Adani’s businesses have proved to be quite resilient in the face of the fraud allegations, and Adani himself is somewhat of a Teflon man,” said Kugelman. “Many investors, recognizing the size and clout of Adani’s businesses, have swallowed the reputational risks associated with doing business with him. The US, based on its West Container Terminal investment, is no exception.”Even as New Delhi seeks to compete with Beijing in infrastructure-led development in South Asia and Africa, it will be a “tall order” for players like Adani to disrupt the status quo, Custer said. But there are signs that China is moving away from big bilateral infrastructure deals after many countries it financed became mired in debt.“We may be at a consequential inflection point,” said Custer. “If this trend continues, there may be a growing gap between the level of infrastructure projects that Beijing is willing to supply versus that which low-and middle-income countries demand, creating a window of opportunity for rival firms.”"

As part of the deal, regional affiliate FlyDubai could take on some orders for the smaller 787 Dreamliner earmarked for Emirates, the people said. Boeing and Emirates declined to comment.An accord with the biggest international airline would be a vital endorsement of Boeing’s newest and largest aircraft, which has struggled to pull in sales as it remains behind schedule for entry into service. Any additional purchase of the plane, which comes with novel folding wing tips, would add to a backlog of 115 777X that Emirates previously ordered.The state-owned carrier is among the largest operators of widebody aircraft, using its hub in Dubai as a global link between the US, Europe and Asia. With the Dubai Air Show kicking off on Monday, the event will provide a backdrop for major deals as carriers rush to replenish and upgrade their fleets.Sales of widebody aircraft have gained momentum back this year, after the market for narrowbodies recovered more quickly from the Covid-19 pandemic.Other operators likely to announce major commitments at the event include Turkish Airlines, which is close to an order for about 350 Airbus SE aircraft, including both narrow- and widebody jets, people close to the talks said earlier.Expanding its fleet with widebody aircraft like the 787 would mark a strategic shift for FlyDubai, which now relies on the Boeing 737 single-aisles for shorter routes around the Middle East, parts of Africa and as far as Malaysia, according to the carrier’s website.Emirates is also in negotiations with Airbus about an order for the European manufacturer’s flagship A350 aircraft. That purchase and the accord with Boeing are still under final negotiations, and terms of the deals and the timing of any announcements could change, the people cautioned.Airbus declined to comment on discussions with customers."

Asia Pacific passenger traffic increased 171 per cent over the same period in 2022, while capacity growth was slower by 130 per cent.As air travel recovered later in Asia than other regions, many Asian airlines could not resume services to Europe to use slots as required by the EU, he added.The loss of these slots affects connectivity between the two regions.International air transport exists under a shared framework of rules and norms at International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Pohl was “effectively seated” as the sole director of Byju’s Alpha because of the defaults, the judge said in a 41-page ruling.Lenders have been pushing hard for the repayment of the $1.2 billion loan amid the company’s mounting distress after a pandemic-era boom in online learning fizzled out. Byju’s had been working to sell assets and deal with the loan issue when government investigators searched company offices this year. The lender fight also has prompted some investors to write down their stakes in one of the world’s largest ed-tech companies.A lawyer for the lenders said earlier this year that Byju’s Alpha was intended to serve as a holding company to protect their rights in the case. The lenders weren’t seeking to take over the entire ed-tech company, Brock Czeschin, a lawyer for Red Tree and Silver Lake, said in a May court hearing.Bengaluru, India-based Byju’s didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The closely held company had said the lenders’ default arguments are bogus.“We are pleased the Delaware Chancery Court agrees that Byju’s has repeatedly defaulted on its loan obligations,” a spokesperson for the lender group said in a statement. “The lenders reserve all rights available to them.”The loan terms allowed lenders to take control of pledged Bjyu’s Alpha shares if a default triggered that right, Zurn said in her Nov. 2 ruling. When a company unit failed to get the Indian government’s backing as a loan guarantor, the lenders filed a notice of default in March, according to a transcript of the judge’s announcement of her decision.Pohl removed all of the company’s officers and took over as CEO after he was was appointed as sole director of Byju’s Alpha, according to the transcript. The suit over the loan was filed by Glas Trust Co., which serves as trustee for the lenders. The trust turned to Pohl to oversee Byju’s Alpha on behalf of the creditors.Byju’s complained that the ex-lawyer, whose received at least $375,000 for his role as the firm’s supreme leader, was reaping excessive fees. Zurn rejected that argument, saying Pohl’s $75,000-per-month pay was authorized by a “status-quo” order she entered in the case to protect Byju’s Alpha.The case is Glas Trust Company v. Ravindran, 2023-0488, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington)."

The Vodafone Idea Limited in its plea said the assessing officer ought to have passed the final order in the case within 30 days as mandated in the Act. Since the officer failed to pass the final order, it was entitled to a refund with interest, the company said.The company also said after it filed the petition in HC in June 2023 seeking refund of the amount, the assessing officer passed the final assessment order in August. The tax department claimed due to the ""Faceless Assessment Regime"" it had not received the DRP's directions.The high court, however, refused to accept this and said the DRP directions were always visible and accessible on the Income Tax Business Application (ITBA) portal. There was also no whisper of any explanation as to why the assessing officer remained inactive and silent for two long years in the case and swung into action only when he received information of the petition filed, it said.We have no hesitation in holding that the assessment order dated August 31, 2023 passed by the assessing officer two years after the DRP directions, is time barred and cannot be sustained, the bench said. Hence, the Vodafone Idea Limited was entitled to receive the refund together with interest, the HC said."

So, overall we expect the industry this year to be more or less flat or maybe grow by plus or minus two percent, depending on how the second last quarter goes,"" Madan said.Madan further added that he expects to see marginal growth of nearly two to three percent in the industry in the third and fourth quarters as well.""In the third quarter, we are looking at marginal growth maybe two to three percent again.

Overall, on a full-year basis, we expect the margin will be higher than Q2 definitely, in the range of 13 to 14 percent in this business,"" Madan said.Speaking about the demand trends in the construction segment, Madan said that the segment is displaying remarkable growth and will likely register 40 to 50 percent growth backed by the government's infrastructure spend.Also Read: Escorts Kubota shares rise 2% on decision to hike tractor prices from Sept 16""Construction equipment is showing good growth, looking at the government spending on the infrastructure space this year, the kind of capex government has earmarked is huge so we are seeing almost 40-50 percent sort of growth coming in the business now. The second half of the year normally is a good period for construction equipment. We think in H2 also demand will continue the same way, so the same momentum will continue,"" Madan said.Madan added that there's also some chance that changes in the emission norms might prompt 'pre-buying' in the last quarter of this year.""There's also the likelihood of some emission norm changes happening from April 1 in this segment. If that happens, there'll be some pre-buying also, which you can see happening in the last quarter of this year,"" Madan said.Talking about Escorts Kubota's railway business, Madan spoke about how a change in the pace of execution might not reflect the kind of growth the business has witnessed.""Looking at the first six months, I think we have already done more than Rs 500 crore of top line in this business. We expect similar numbers for the second half. The order book number might not show that sort of growth because the execution pace has now increased. We have seen more than 40-45 percent growth in this business, so definitely the pace of order execution has also increased,"" Madan said.Madan further added that the company will be able to execute the current order book over the next six to eight months."

Countries such as China, Japan and South Korea have proven it. India’s Gen Z will now have to dig deep to find the work ethic in its own cultural roots. That may be the only way forward","A recent interview with a widely respected corporate leader has sparked heated debate. A larger statement made on work culture and productivity has been taken out of context to focus solely on a suggestion of long work hours by the current generation for economic success and national growth. This has been criticised as being out of step with Generation Z's life aspirations or work-life balance. Much newsprint, prime time, and social media have since been devoted to various views on the subject.The 10,000 Hour RuleGeneration Z will, of course, make their own personal choices, which will determine the trajectory of their own future and that of the nation. But the wider relationship between time spent on a task and developing expertise has long been recognised. The ""10,000 hour"" rule, as articulated by author and thinker Malcolm Gladwell in his book ""Outliers,"" best summarises it. When discussing the Beatles, the most successful music band in history, he quotes John Lennon about the Beatles' early days performing at a Hamburg club. ""We had to play for eight hours. We got better and got more confidence. We couldn’t help it with all the experience of playing all night long. We had to try even harder, put our heart and soul into it .. in Liverpool, we’d only done one-hour sessions, and we just used to do our best numbers, the same ones, at everyone. In Hamburg, we had to play for eight hours, so really had to find a new way of playing”. Gladwell then quotes neurologist Daniel Levitin: ""The emerging picture from studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert in anything... in study after study of composers, basketball players, fiction writers, ice skaters, concert pianists, chess players, master criminals, and what have you, this number comes up again and again.""Gladwell recognises, however, that practice alone is insufficient. Talent and opportunity are also required. One must be in the right place at the right time. By a stroke of fortune, India's Generation Z is in the right place and at the right time. Does it have the perseverance and practice to seize the opportunity to make themselves and India an outperforming outlier in a bleak global scenario? Swami Vivekananda once advised a young generation to ""take up one idea."" Make that one idea your life; dream of it, think of it, and live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, and every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.” In management jargon, it's called self-actualization—becoming the best version of oneself. The big question, however, is: how does Generation Z choose to view its future? Is it the slavish drudgery of a mindless 70-hour work week or the endless possibilities and fulfilment of a smarter 10,000-hour mastery, expertise, and leadership?Culture And DevelopmentWhat is true for individuals and groups is also true for nations. Culture is now recognised as an important factor in the political, institutional, and economic development of nations. According to Daniel Moynihan, a prominent American sociologist, “the central conservative truth is that culture, not politics, determines a society's success. While the central liberal truth is that politics can both change and save a culture”.There is a growing recognition that the economic success of each civilization's nation-states is also based on their core shared cultural values. If the West's economic growth has been attributed in large part to what German sociologist and economist Max Weber referred to as ""the Protestant Ethic"" for the rise of capitalism, China and much of East Asia's more recent rise have been attributed to ""Confucian values"" such as thrift, hard work, and discipline.Politics shaping culture and mass mobilisation have also played an important role in nation-states and their economic development trajectory. The rise of Japan, South Korea, and China in the modern era bears testimony to this. All tapped into the resurgence of a latent but strong work ethic in their societies. India, too, attempted to realise this central liberal truth through exhortations for mass mobilisation and improving work ethic and productivity, like “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan” in the 1960s and the less successful “Garibi Hatao” in the 1970s. However, it soon entered an era when political capital became scarce, coalition governments survived on fractured arithmetic politics, and cynical electoral considerations were  paramount.Economic reforms in India began in 1991, but in an unfavourable political and cultural environment. As a result, reforms were shallow, and India was unable to fully capitalise on the opportunities of the time. India has elected a majority government at the Centre since 2014, allowing for political stability and a long-term view of India's development needs. During this time, the need for reviving and mobilising its culture's latent work ethic has become apparent, and tentative, if symbolic, steps toward the evolution of an all-inclusive cultural mobilisation have also occurred.However, it is also true that modern politics, whether socialist-secularism or religious-nationalism, has been unable to reconcile the long-term imperative of a unifying development narrative with the short-term incentives of political parties winning votes by pandering to multiple identities and interest groups.  The challenge of transformative mass mobilisation to address India's deep-rooted socio-cultural issues that impede its development remains. It is these challenges that Gen Z will have to face in the lead-up to the nation’s centenary celebrations in 2047. A national narrative for a unifying work ethic that draws upon India’s civilizational ethos would go a long way in crafting a new and inclusive mass mobilisation that would harness both conservative and liberal truths for the development of the country.Getting To A Strong Work EthicIt is a line of cultural thought that is supported by Landes in his analysis of socio-cultural characteristics that influence economic development ""You want high productivity? Then you should live to work and get happiness as a by-product. Not easy. The people who live to work are a small and fortunate elite. But it is an elite open to newcomers, self-selected, the kind of people who accentuate the positive. In this world, the optimists have it, not because they are always right but because they are positive. Even when wrong, they are positive, and that is the way of achievement, correction, improvement, and success. Educated, eyes-open optimism pays; pessimism can only offer the empty consolation of being right.”Or more simply, as Lord Krishna advised Arjuna in the Bhagvad Gita (Chapter 2, Verse 47), “Karmanye vadhikaraste Ma Phaleshu Kadachana, Ma Karmaphalaheturbhurma Te Sangostavakarmani”. You have the right to work only, but never to its fruits. Let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let your attachment be to inaction”.Harvard or the Bhagvad Gita, both pose a question for Gen Z to ponder. It is also not only about the hours put into a task but also how smartly and productively they are used. A strong work ethic and productivity are not a zero-sum game in a stagnant pond, but a rising tide that holds out the promise to lift all boats in the sea of personal, professional, and national development. Clearly, cultivating positive cultural attitudes for the future will matter more than we think it will.Sandeep Hasurkar is an ex-investment banker and author of `Never Too Big To Fail: The Collapse of IL&FS’.

The economy seems to be decoupled from what’s going on in the rest of the world.”The world’s largest alternative asset manager has been active in India, where it recently acquired a stake in two hospital chains. But it’s been relatively quiet when it comes to private equity deals in Japan in the past two years, despite broader foreign investor interest in the island nation.Blackstone would be open to do deals in Japan that are anywhere from $300 million to more than $2 billion, and in sectors like IT, healthcare and consumer, Baratta said. He added that it has transactions in the consumer and industrial sector in the pipeline.Baratta was in Tokyo to meet with Blackstone’s private equity executives across Asia, where they were discussing strategy and meeting with global investors who had flown in.The New York-based firm’s only two private equity portfolio companies in Japan are Ayumi Pharmaceutical Corp. and Alinamin Pharmaceutical Co., which was the former consumer healthcare unit of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. It bought the latter in a 242 billion ($1.6 billion) deal. Talks for Blackstone to join the buyout of Toshiba Corp. as an equity investor were stalled earlier this year.It’s been a difficult time for the private equity industry, as dealmaking has dried up with high interest rates, banks becoming more hesitant to lend, and volatile markets. Last month, Blackstone reported a 12% decline in quarterly profit available to shareholders.Still, Baratta said the company’s private equity pipeline is more robust right now than at any time since Blackstone pulled back on dealmaking in mid-2021, when inflation started becoming a concern. The firm finished raising an $11 billion Asia buyout fund in January 2022.Japan has been one of the last holdouts among developed economies when it comes to rock-bottom rates, although that might soon change after the central bank signaled last week that it was easing its grip on long-term yields. But Baratta said the Bank of Japan’s policy did not impact the firm’s decision making on investments.“The cost of financing doesn’t represent a large component of the return that we’re generating in private equity,” he said. “Japan is as interesting as it’s ever been, notwithstanding changes in BOJ policy that may portend higher interest rates.”The weak yen — which has fallen more than 20% against the dollar in the past two years on the interest rate differential between the US and Japan — does provide a potential allure for Blackstone. “It may make us feel generally better about investing in a moment in time versus not,” Baratta said."

It could copy Tata and head towards product assembly, a field ripe for further Indian investment as global brands seek to reduce reliance on China","A $125 million deal by Tata Group will one day become a case study for Indian industrial policy. The conglomerate has a high chance of success through buying its way into iPhone manufacturing, offering rival empires like mining group Vedanta Ltd a lesson on the better path toward industrial expansion.Wistron Corp, a Taipei-based maker of computers, servers and smartphones, is slowly exiting its business of assembling Apple Inc’s marquee product. Two years ago, it sold a Chinese unit that makes iPhones to Luxshare Precision Industry Co for 3.35 billion yuan ($457 million). On Oct. 27, it announced the sale of Wistron InfoComm Manufacturing (India) Private Ltd, known as WMMI, to Tata Electronics Private Ltd.Both sides had been in discussion for over a year, so this transaction was widely expected. Wistron’s annual report shows improving revenue and operating income at WMMI, yet a post-tax loss for the division. Although the global smartphone market is currently in a slump, Tata ought to be able to drag the business to break even within a few years. That’s the easy part.Tata faces stiff competition from Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp, both of which are expanding in India. There’s a reason Wistron struggled to make much headway into Apple’s supply chain. Both larger rivals are more adept at a broader array of steps involved in manufacturing, including the parts that go inside as well as assembly of partially completed electronics subsystems.Tata, at least, has already made the right start. By its own account, Tata Electronics is a “venture of the Tata group with expertise in manufacturing precision components.” This is the most lucrative aspect of electronics production, and is the backbone from which Foxconn started 30 years ago, with the Taipei-based company now assembling more than 70 percent of Apple’s iPhones. Buying a top-end factory from Wistron to move into assembly is an incremental step for Tata, not a completely fresh start, and augurs well for a successful future.Contrast that to Vedanta, where billionaire chief Anil Agarwal is hoping to pivot into semiconductors. A year ago, the company had bold plans to set up a fresh chip factory in Gujarat, and had named Foxconn as a partner. The numbers didn’t make sense back then, and the project is even less coherent now.Initial figures for around $20 billion of investment and 100,000 employees don’t accord with the semiconductor sector, which is capital intensive but uses very few staff. By contrast, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is the world’s largest dedicated chipmaker but had just 73,000 employees at the end of last year. Vedanta’s plan included the less technology-intensive business of chip testing as well as flat-panel displays, but in reality, the figures it publicised seem intended for government officials tasked with handing out subsidies than any realistic plan.Within a year, Foxconn withdrew its support — which wasn’t a great surprise since it offered a mere $119 million and only signed a memorandum of understanding days before Vedanta needed to submit its application for government grants.Vedanta’s decision to diversify away from resources and mining is not, in itself, a mistake. Taiwan’s Formosa Plastics Group made its way to becoming one of the world’s biggest memory-chip makers after founding Nanya Technology Corp in 1995. But that was after it leveraged a commanding position in plastics to become a key supplier of printed-circuit boards — made from fiberglass — while another division division started in PC sales before moving into computer assembly. Other electronics giants have come from more traditional backgrounds, including Nokia Oyj (pulp, rubber) and Nintendo Co (playing cards).Instead, Vedanta’s big mistake is to chase exciting, headline-grabbing businesses like chip fabrication without first mastering the basics. There are numerous business models it could choose: design and make its own chips, manufacture for external clients, or even wade into the capital-intensive memory sector. Each path offers stiff competition, and there’s nothing to suggest Vedanta has an edge in any of them. Even if it could carve out a niche, there’s another bigger problem: nationalism.Political pressure and national security concerns have spurred governments to fund new facilities from TSMC in Europe, the US and Japan. Tokyo is also spending money to found a local rival called Rapidus Corp and subsidise a new factory from Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and local investment group SBI Holdings Inc. Beijing, meanwhile, continues to put semiconductor independence at the forefront of government policy.Instead of diving into the increasingly chaotic chipmaking sector, Vedanta ought to slow down and make a start in more labour-intensive businesses like testing, packaging and assembly — akin to what US memory-chip leader Micron Technology Inc is planning for Gujarat. Or it could copy Tata and head in the direction of product assembly, a field ripe for further Indian investment as global brands seek to reduce reliance on China.Business diversification and revitalisation is the right direction for Indian business. But industrial policy needs to be based on what makes sense, not what makes headlines.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Except for tractors, which saw an 8 per cent decline, all categories exhibited commendable growth,"" Singhania said.Two-wheelers, three-wheelers, commercial vehicles, and passenger vehicles experienced increases of 22 per cent, 43 per cent, 9 per cent, and 7 per cent, respectively during Navratri, he added.Singhania further said the two-wheeler category during the Navratri period and throughout October saw several positive trends, buoyed by festive cheer and stronger rural demand. The passenger vehicles segment navigated a complex landscape, marked by both enthusiasm and caution, he said, adding, ""during Navratri, despite regional variability, the industry witnessed a surge in bookings"" buoyed by the introduction of new models, particularly SUVs and the availability of attractive consumer offers.""However, the impact of local elections and market saturation meant that the festive spirit didn't translate uniformly into sales across all regions,"" he added.The three-wheeler segment continued the uptick in demand during Navratri, largely driven by competitive finance options and a significant rise in e-Rickshaw interest, signalling a healthy move towards electrification, Singhania said.Throughout October, Singhania said, ""The anticipation for Diwali in November and the launch of new models generated a steady demand. The period overall saw a resilient PV market, supported by a stronger product line-up unlike last year, when stock availability was a major issue.""On the outlook, FADA said, ""The near-term outlook for the auto sector is a blend of highs and lows as we approach year-end.""Festivities along with harvest season, especially paddy, are expected to boost two-wheeler sales, with optimism fuelled by new schemes and a push towards electrification, despite supply concerns, it added.Commercial vehicle segment is looking at a strong November, with festive and construction activities enhancing demand, alongside anticipated financial schemes, FADA said.""However, the PV segment is navigating through a tricky phase. Festive days might spike bookings, yet the shadow of year-end discounts looms over immediate sales,"" FADA said.High inventory levels in PVs, at a critical 63-66 days range, demand urgent attention from OEMs, it said, adding, ""Without substantial interventions and if Diwali sales don't rise to the occasion, the weight of unsold stock could lead to significant dealer distress"".It could lead to industry-wide repercussions, FADA said, asserting ""Immediate and decisive action is imperative to counter the risk of a financial squeeze as the year closes."""

Those fines have been piling up since August 14.Meta said it has cooperated with regulators and pointed to its announced plans to give Europeans the opportunity to consent to data collection and, later this month, to offer an ad-free subscription service in Europe that will cost 9.99 euros (USD 10.59) a month for access to all its products. The latest decision unjustifiably ignores that careful and robust regulatory process, the company said in a statement following the European board’s action.Tobias Judin, head of the international section at the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, said Meta’s proposed steps likely won’t meet European legal standards. For instance, he said, consent would have to be freely given, which wouldn’t be the case if existing users had to choose between giving up their privacy rights or paying a financial penalty in the form of a subscription.""Meta’s business model is at odds with the law and users’ fundamental rights, and Meta will not back down willingly,"" Judin said via email. They continue with their unlawful activities to this very day, simply because breaking the law is so profitable."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/independent-directors-must-step-up-to-their-onerous-roles-or-step-back-11644791.html,Independent directors must step up to their onerous roles or step back,"November 01, 2023 05:36 PM IST","With the advent of shareholder and media activism, the Companies Act allowing class action suits, increasing oversight by regulators and action by enforcement agencies, the position of independent directors has become highly vulnerable to civil and criminal liability","Independent directors have onerous responsibilities stipulated in the Companies Act, the Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations, and the common law. They are expected to play strategic, advisory and overseeing roles through the boardroom processes and add value to the growth and prospects of a company while remaining conscious of the tenets of good governance.The omnibus Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013, requires independent directors to be objective, fair, knowledgeable, considerate, diligent, transparent and independent in judgement. Failure in any manner may invite civil and criminal liability. Independent directors are now even being held accountable for the lackadaisical approach of companies towards larger climate change concerns.In India, the role of independent directors has come under public and judicial scrutiny in cases related to Enron, Satyam Computer, IL&FS, Dewan Housing Finance and HDIL and have also led to reforms in the law.The Companies Act, which for the first time recognised the concept of an independent director, provides that independent directors shall be held liable not only for such omissions or commissions by a company that occurred with their knowledge and with their consent or connivance but also when they did not act in a bona fide or diligent manner or could have prevented them.Onus On ThemSchedule IV accordingly outlines the roles, duties and responsibilities of independent directors. Similar provisions are contained in Section 27 (2) of the SEBI Act and regulation 25 (5) of the SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015.The courts have since tested the liability of independent directors in various cases of corporate malfeasance, fraud or lapses. Independent directors thus have no immunity from being prosecuted or subjected to other legal proceedings. The onus is on them to prove that they acted in a bona fide manner and diligently and in the manner required.It is indeed frightening, but not unreasonable, to see the significant role they have in ensuring good governance in companies with a large number of stakeholders with varying and often conflicting interests. Independent directors have been empowered legally and otherwise to be able to play that role effectively.They need to be cognisant of their role and shareholder expectations and accordingly tune their mindset and approach.The position of an independent director is not part-time or pastime one or a post-retirement luxury. It requires professionalism just as any other profession, whether it is chartered accountancy, company secretary, legal or engineering.Their role, responsibility and liability remain the same whether or not they are remunerated adequately. Being an expert in a field or a person of eminence is good but not enough. They cannot rely only on the knowledge, experience or skill sets of other directors.At the same time, they need not be experts or knowledgeable in all aspects before or during their tenure as independent directors. All they need is the basic idea of the type of skills they require and they can build on them.For instance, they may not be chartered accountants to understand financial statements, but they should be aware of critical information such as related-party transactions, cooked profit, changes in accounting policies, and fair value measurements.They should develop an understanding of audit reports and know how to look for gaps in audit reports and notes to the accounts or greenwashing in a director’s report.Due DiligenceEnsuring that the appointment of auditors is fair and transparent and knowing the process followed for the purpose simply needs an appreciation of its criticality and developing a probing approach.Before accepting appointments as independent directors, they should get a good idea about the company, its promoters and directors, its ecosystem, and its risk profile. They should get at least a preliminary understanding of the industry or sector, the competition, the technology used, and the organisation’s structure and culture. These can be obtained from the company itself, in publicly available information or through their own contacts.The sources of information include documents filed with the Registrar of Companies, SEBI, the stock exchanges, publicly available annual reports, auditor’s reports, industry and market analyst reports, and civil or criminal cases from the newspapers.Acceptance merely on the basis of familiarity with the promoters, the lure of the position, the sitting fee or the general reputation of the company should be avoided. Carrying out a reasonable level of due diligence before acceptance will enable independent directors to have a clear perspective of their role consistent with the requirements of the Companies Act and SEBI regulations.Independent directors need to spend an average of 200 to 300 hours per company on preparation for meetings, participation in meetings, and follow-ups after meetings. Board meeting agendas often run up to 1,000 pages and are not structured to focus on important matters like strategy, sustainability, risk, and regulatory noncompliance.Developing an understanding of the agenda papers requires considerable pre-meeting diligence and mining of these papers to find critical issues and relevant information to enable meaningful participation in discussions and reaching an objective and fair judgment.Undertaking due diligence before a meeting is important, but that in itself is not enough. Developing a reasoned point of view and the soft skills for articulating them with the ability to patiently listen to the views of others will help in gaining respect and acceptability across board members.A clear understanding of the subject matter and its associated issues will also help in expressing a reasoned dissent when needed and recording that in the minutes of the meeting. No board member will appreciate the views of someone who talks only to attract attention.When an independent director is also the chairman of the board, there is the additional responsibility of conducting the meeting effectively by ensuring the quality of the agenda, the discussions are orderly and focussed, and making full use of the expertise of individual board members.With the advent of shareholder and media activism, the Companies Act allowing class action suits, increasing oversight by regulators and action by enforcement agencies, the position of independent directors has become highly vulnerable to civil and criminal liability.It has become necessary for them to act in a bona fide and diligent manner while playing their roles and performing their duties and responsibilities as laid down in the law. Such an approach will enable them to play the role expected of them effectively.Ashok Haldia is a Chartered Accountant. Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."

Goenka's resuming the office will help accelerate the stalled process, said Diviay Chadha, partner at the legal firm Singhania & Co.Also read: With their merger looming, here’s a look at how Zee, Sony fared on key parameters in FY23""A pre-condition for the merger was that Punit Goenka should be the managing director of the merged entity for five years. This scheme of amalgamation has also been approved by NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal). Thus, this order paves the way for the effective closure of the Zee-Sony merger,"" said advocate Ravi Prakash, associate partner at Corporate Professionals.While the merger of Zee and Sony was approved by the NCLT earlier in August this year, the quashing of the Sebi Order will likely assist the two entities to complete all formalities and close the transaction, said Smiti Tewari, partner at Khaitan Legal Associates.Also read: NCLT approves Zee-Sony merger, dismisses all objectionsThe markets regulator had on August 14 prevented Goenka from serving as a key managerial person (KMP) in Zee and its related entities resulting from the Zee-Sony merger or other means. ""With this development (the SAT order of October 30), Goenka is now eligible to assume the positions of chairman and managing director (CMD) as envisaged under the Zee-Sony merger scheme and approved by the NCLT order dated August 10, 2023. Further, he can also take up the role of director or any other key managerial position,"" said Manmeet Kaur, partner at Karanjawala & Co.Also read: Zee row: SAT sets aside Sebi bar on Punit Goenka from holding key managerial slotsSebi investigationTewari said that as far as the Sebi investigation is concerned, the SAT order is unlikely to have a real impact as what has been quashed by the tribunal is an interim order of Sebi and not the entire investigation which is still on. ""As a matter of procedure, Sebi can challenge the SAT order before the Supreme Court,"" she pointed out.The markets watchdog will further intensify its efforts to carry out a much more thorough and robust investigation into the matter, indicated Rajesh Begur, managing partner at Begur & Partners.SAT has clarified that its order will not come in the way of the broader investigation that Sebi is undertaking, experts pointed out.Zee-Sony mergerIn the scenario where Sebi gives a go-ahead in favour of Goenka, without going to the Supreme Court, analysts expect the Zee and Sony merger to complete by November.This would mean that the listing of the merged company will happen towards the first week of January 2024, said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president, Elara Capital.Also read: Sony says Zee merger to be delayed by a few months""Further, with Punit Goenka coming on Board, there will be no need for any changes in the term sheet, or any Board or shareholder approval will be required for change in CEO. This means that business will be as usual for ZEE and lesser transition time will be needed with little change in senior management,"" he said.However, he mentioned that there are bleak chances of Sony allowing Goenka to continue as CEO of the merged entity, unless the Sebi investigation is resolved. ""In case of Sebi going to the Supreme Court, there may be a delay in the merger too if Goenka waits for the outcome of the investigation. In case of Sony not waiting, then merger is likely to go through as usual and the merged company will get listed by January 2024,"" he said.He said that Zee and Sony as a merged entity could potentially command a market share of 53 percent in the TV and streaming business in India."

On Monday, the shares closed 12.7% higher on hopes the talks will bear fruit.Sources had told Reuters on Sunday that Siemens Energy was weighing measures to boost its balance sheet, including further asset sales, following a recent deal to sell its Trench high voltage component division to Triton.With input from Reuters."

Israel-Hamas war to have no long-term impact on Indian business, CEOs sayA big majority of CEOs (86.67 percent) of Indian firms see no long-term impact from the war between Israel and Hamas on their operations or sales, even as they view volatile crude oil prices and geopolitical instability as significant concerns, according to a dipstick survey of 15 chief executives. As many as 60 percent do not see an immediate rise in costs.Why it’s important: More than the war in Israel and Gaza, it is the potential jump in crude oil prices that Indian business sees as a threat as energy costs would rise. Financing costs are also rising on increased yields on US treasury bonds, which is another concern.#2. Younger generation and new geographies lead rise in investor accounts in IndiaThe growth in investor accounts in recent times is being driven by increased participation of the younger generation and there are account additions from new areas. In the past 30 months, 12.7 million accounts have been opened by those between 18 and 20 years old and 17.7 million by individuals in the 20-30 age group, whereas 36.8 million accounts were initiated by those between 30 and 40 years old, BSE data show.Why it’s important: The proliferation of user-friendly investing apps is propelling the participation of young people, including college students, in trading and investing. As direct investors, many of them may not be fully aware of market risks and the regulator may need to step up its awareness programs.#3. Malaysian Gentari and Singapore’s GIC to invest $1.75 billion in AM Green AmmoniaGentari Sdn Bhd and GIC Holdings will invest $1.75 billion in AM Green Ammonia Holdings owned by Greenko Group founders Mahesh Kolli and Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty. A unit of Malaysia’s Petronas, Gentari, will invest $1.5 billion for 30 percent, valuing the company at $5 billion. The founders will hold the balance along with Singaporean wealth fund GIC, which will invest $250 million.Why it’s important: The transaction could mark one of the world’s largest energy transition deals. Investors are rushing into the green energy space as the hydrocarbon business sees increased disruptions.#4. Adani Group invests close to $1 billion in Navi Mumbai International AirportThe Adani Group has invested close to $1 billion in Navi Mumbai international airport to start operations by December next year. Of the Rs 8,625 crore ($991 million) invested in the Navi Mumbai airport so far, Adani made an equity infusion of Rs 1,710 crore. It has also raised Rs 2,900 crore in term loans from a consortium of banks, while an additional Rs 3,655 crore equity came from Cidco. Adani and Cidco will invest an additional Rs 1,511 crore as the project moves ahead.Why it’s important: After the Adani Group faced a market rout earlier this year due to an adverse report by short-seller Hindenburg Research, there were concerns that the Navi Mumbai airport, envisaged in 1999 and taken over by Adani in 2017, would face further delays. The fresh commitments would allay those fears.#5. Headcount at top software firms falls for the first time in 25 yearsNine of India’s top 10 software services firms, employing more than 2 million people, have seen their workforce shrink in the six months to September 30, a situation seen for the first time in more than 25 years as clients in the US and Europe cut spending amid rising economic and geopolitical risks. The current fiscal may mark the first instance of IT firms ending the year with fewer employees than at the beginning.Why it’s important: IT companies have been the largest generators of formal employment in India for decades. That dream run seems to be ending even as the country faces a deepening jobs crisis.#6. Highway authority’s infrastructure trust to raise Rs 9,000 crore after DiwaliThe National Highways Infra Trust sponsored by the National Highways Authority of India plans to raise Rs 9,000 crore after Diwali through a mix of debt and equity. The infrastructure investment trust’s third round of fundraising, involving the monetization of six 250km highway stretches, will be conducted in phases, targeting domestic and global investors.Why it’s important: The highways authority has so far raised around Rs 11,000 crore through this route. The new announcement shows that asset monetization remains a focal point for the authority.#7. Young working class, reforms make India an attractive investment destinationThe government’s progressive and reformer mindset should bring considerable overseas funds into India, Hindustan Unilever’s managing director Rohit Jawa has said. “The Indian economy is unstoppable because of the sheer demographics of a billion people of working age,” Jawa said. “At this point of time in geopolitics, India is sweetly positioned. So, that does mean there will be considerable foreign investment coming in.”Why it’s important: The Indian economy is a demonstrated growth outlier amid sputtering expansion elsewhere in the world due to geopolitical uncertainties. Corporate enthusiasm might not be misplaced.#8. India fastest growing office for cyber security firm Palo Alto NetworksIn the last five years, India has been the fastest-growing office of US-based Palo Alto Networks, according to chief executive Nikesh Arora. The cybersecurity provider has emerged as a dark horse, with its stock rallying 72 percent so far this year, and as much as 288 percent in the past five years. It topped its achievements by breaking into the S&P 500 Index in June.Why it’s important: As the world goes increasingly online, cyberattacks have gone from the hobbyist’s realm to a professional concern. Stakes are rising for cybersecurity and Palo Alto is capitalizing on that.#9. Government may ask state-owned firms to cough up higher dividendsThe government may demand higher dividend payouts from state-run companies should it miss revenue targets outlined in the national budget. It may also seek special dividends from state-run oil companies, which have reported bumper profits because of soaring crude prices.Why it’s important: Despite resilient economic growth, policymakers fear that tax collections could be sluggish and asset sales would certainly be lower than expected. Dividends from public-sector firms could bridge any potential shortfall.#10. India’s largest luxury mall by Reliance Industries opens doors on November 1India is about to gain a new luxury shopping destination as Reliance Industries unveils the country’s largest luxury shopping venue, Jio World Plaza, on November 1 at Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex. The mall will host luxury brands such as Bvlgari, Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Valentino, Manish Malhotra, Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla, and Pottery Barn, among others.Why it’s important: India’s consumer market at the upper end is growing much faster than the middle and lower ends. Disposable income of the well-off is rising and luxury brands want a share of that."

In contrast, a long-term vision focusing on growth, scalability, and well-being of the work focus will repay itself manifold","In today's fast-paced business landscape, the allure of instant gratification and quick success can be enticing for enterprises. The pursuit of immediate results often leads to the adoption of extremist choices to expedite organisational goals.However, this short-sighted focus can result in the wastage of valuable management bandwidth when organisations fail to persist with projects and strategies that require time to manifest outcomes aligned with long-term objectives.The consequences of this fixation on instant gratification are profound and can ultimately wear organisations down. High levels of burnout, attrition, erosion of culture, and a loss of purpose are common by-products, and these issues significantly impact organisational performance.This article serves as a guide on how to resist the allure of instant success and instead focus on investments that foster growth, scale, perpetual success, and employee well-being. It underscores the importance of balancing short-term pressures from stock markets and financial investors with the long-term vision set by Boards and Leadership. These arguments are reinforced by relevant data that highlight the negative consequences of prioritising short-term gains over long-term sustainability.Temptation And Pitfalls Of Instant Success Instant gratification may promise a quick route to success, but it often comes at a steep cost:High Burnout Rates: Research, including studies by the American Psychological Association, consistently demonstrates that organisations fixated on instant success tend to experience higher levels of employee burnout. The relentless pursuit of immediate results places undue stress on employees. Excessive stress and anxiety trigger cortisol release, impairing memory, focus, and decision-making, reducing productivity.Elevated Attrition Rates: Data from the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) suggests that organisations that continually shift their focus in pursuit of instant success face higher attrition rates. Employees are more likely to leave when they perceive their work environment as inconsistent and short-sighted.Erosion of Organisational Culture: The Corporate Culture and Performance report from Harvard Business Review underscores that an excessive emphasis on immediate gratification can corrode an organisation's culture. This leads to a decline in employee morale, engagement, and a loss of a shared sense of purpose.Impact On Organisational PerformanceDecreased Employee Engagement: Research conducted by Towers Watson reveals that organisations prioritising instant success and immediate rewards report significantly lower levels of employee engagement. Engaged employees are integral to the performance of high-achieving organisations.Suppression of Innovation: The pursuit of instant success can stifle innovation within an organisation. Data from a study by Accenture Strategy indicates that organisations emphasising long-term strategies tend to foster more innovative environments.Diminished Long-term Profitability: Research published in the Journal of Financial Economics as well as one done by McKinsey indicates that companies focused on short-term gains and extremist strategies tend to underperform their peers over the long term.Balancing Short-Term And Long-Term Goals""The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now."" - Chinese ProverbThis proverb aptly illustrates the principle of taking action today to reap rewards tomorrow. Boards and Leadership must understand that long-term investments are the seeds for future prosperity.""Perseverance is not a long race; it is many short races one after the other."" - Walter ElliotWalter Elliot's quote underscores that sustained success requires a series of strategic actions. Boards and Leadership must grasp that achieving organisational goals is not a single sprint but a marathon of well-planned, methodical steps.A Call To Action For Boards And LeadershipCultivate a Long-term Vision: Boards and Leadership must nurture a clear, inspiring long-term vision for the organisation that goes beyond immediate achievements. This vision should emphasise growth, scalability, and the well-being of the workforce as key components of success. Apple and Tesla are probably the best examples.Prioritise Employee Well-being: The well-being of employees should be at the core of organisational strategy. Support programs, flexible work arrangements, and a healthy work-life balance are essential for reducing burnout and attrition. Based on AON’s National Wellbeing survey post Covid 85% or organisations surveyed reported mental resilience had a direct impact on their financial performance.Promote a Positive Culture: Boards and Leadership should cultivate a robust, inclusive organisational culture that fosters teamwork, innovation, and a shared sense of purpose. Employees should feel proud to be part of the organisation and motivated to contribute to its long-term success.Invest in Continuous Learning: Developing leadership capabilities and providing ongoing training are essential for building a strong leadership pipeline. Leaders should be equipped with the skills and knowledge required to navigate complex challenges and make informed, strategic decisions for the long-term benefit of the organisation.The pursuit of instant gratification and extremist choices may offer fleeting moments of satisfaction, but the ultimate cost is high. Boards and Leadership must acknowledge that unwavering focus on immediate results can come at the expense of employee well-being, culture erosion, and long-term profitability.Sustainable growth, scalability, perpetual success, and employee well-being should be the guiding principles for every decision. As you guide your organisation into the future, remember that long-term success necessitates a thoughtful balance between the next quarter and the next quarter century.The data and insights provided offer a compelling argument for prioritising the well-being of your workforce and the long-term health of your organisation. This path leads not just to success but to enduring prosperity and purpose, despite the pressures from shareholders and external stakeholders.Rituparna Chakraborty is Co-founder, TeamLease, and Independent Director.

The company is catering to the domestic market through institutional business, sales to other oil companies and through its own retail chain. Natural exports markets are in the Middle East, Africa and South-East Asia - the markets which have a consistent appetite for Nayara's products throughout the year.Commercially, it is unviable to cater to the seasonal requirements of EU markets (winter grade diesel). ""Nayara's diesel does not meet the winter specification requirements of the EU market, we see no commercial opportunity in this market,"" it said. Domestic sales made up for 69 per cent of the volumes during January-September 2023 and exports the remaining 31 per cent.Out of the total 4.57 million tonne exports, diesel shipments stood at about 2.44 million tonne which is roughly 53 per cent of all exports for the same period. The company said geographical proximity governs its exports markets. ""Africa, Southeast Asia and the Middle East continue to remain the company's primary export markets contributing to about 82 per cent of the total exports of petroleum products.""Between January-September 2023, Nayara supplied no gasoil and gasoline to Europe. ""Our primary focus for gasoline remains ensuring consistent supply to domestic markets through our retail outlets, and oil companies,"" Nayara said adding gasoline export sales were flat at 0.9 million tonne in January-September 2023 when compared with the year-ago period.Gasoil percentage export sales in the European Union has been less than 3 per cent of total gasoil exports during the last 5 years, it said adding Nayara supplied no diesel to Europe this year. Also, ""no gasoline has been exported to Europe,"" it said.The company is primarily focused on catering to the domestic market through institutional business, sales to other oil companies and through its own retail chain. India structurally, is long on diesel and the surplus is to be exported after satisfying domestic demand.Nayara is the fastest growing private retail network with the addition of around 500 retail outlets every year. Nayara network is fully automated (98 per cent of outlets) for enhanced controls and standards.Prasad Panicker, Chairman and Head of Refinery, Nayara Energy, said, ""As an Indian company, Nayara is in India and for India. We are highly committed and driven to fuel the nation's growing demand for energy. As a major downstream player, delivering about 8 per cent of India's refining output, Nayara Energy is contributing significantly towards India's energy security.""""We believe in being a strong partner to India's energy needs and will continue to serve the country's consumption demands. In the near future, we will also start to contribute towards India's growing demand in the field of petrochemicals,"" he added."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/the-problem-with-attacking-chinas-green-subsidies-is-that-they-dont-exist-11609491.html,The problem with attacking China’s green subsidies is that they don’t exist,"October 27, 2023 10:57 AM IST",The low cost of Chinese-made green tech isn’t due to anything that WTO would consider a subsidy. It’s manufacturers are encouraged to invest on a scale that the world can't compete against. But China's rigid state-owned companies and off-the-books financing give ample fodder for trade partners justifying protectionist restrictions,"As the US slams a backdoor entry for Chinese-made solar panels and the European Union examines trade restrictions on electric vehicles and wind turbines, there’s one point on which most people agree: China’s clean-energy products are cheaper because the sector is being grossly subsidised.One problem with that theory: There’s no evidence that such subsidies exist. The low cost of Chinese-made green tech isn’t due to anything that the World Trade Organization would consider a subsidy. It’s largely a result of the fact that the country’s vast size, along with the environmental targets the WTO’s rules were written to protect, encourage manufacturers to invest on a scale that puts the rest of the world to shame.Subsidy accusations get thrown around so freely because they’re a useful bogeyman in trade discussions. Our own industrial support is usually pervasive and popular, though. Few but the most extreme libertarians would object to the $18 billion in government funds that the US provided to help develop a vaccine against Covid-19. European governments have spent €651 billion ($695 billion) since late 2021 shielding consumers from rising electricity prices. Subsidies for fossil fuels last year amounted to $7 trillion, or about 7.1 percent of global economic product, according to the International Monetary Fund.The ubiquity of subsidies means there’s a high bar to considering them anti-competitive at the WTO. It’s not enough to point to the availability of cheaper land, energy, finance or labour and label it a subsidy: Governments must be shown to be favouring specific industries. Glance through the WTO’s databases for evidence of successful actions against China’s low-carbon technology, and you’ll come up short. Of more than 50 disputes since it joined in 2001, there have been cases involving steel tubes, barley, wine, auto parts and rare earths, among many other products. Just one has related specifically to renewables, a case about wind equipment that’s been dormant since 2011.That’s not stopped cases being brought at the national and regional level, where circumstantial evidence is sufficient. The US has levied duties of 40 percent or more on Chinese-made panels since 2012, based on claims that its manufacturers were unable to match Chinese competitors because of dumping at below-market prices. That argument looked dubious at the time, and seems even more so in hindsight, considering the way solar prices globally plummeted during the period. Similarly, pressure to open cases is increasing in the EU just as a new anti-subsidy law passed last year enters into force and gives officials fresh powers.The danger is that these spurious cases will wind up hindering the path to net-zero. Many of China’s trading partners have framed trade barriers locking out its green-power equipment as an energy-security necessity, essential for protecting domestic manufacturers against rapacious undercutting by Beijing’s government-industrial complex. In practice they may simply be raising the amount they’ll have to spend on renewable equipment, while coddling uncompetitive local businesses that haven’t invested sufficiently in the energy transition.The current shape of subsidy policies is a mess, as Jennifer Hillman and Inu Manak of the Council of Foreign Relations argued in a paper last month. Trade-distorting activity is almost impossible to investigate or police, and countries have largely given up on obligations to report their subsidies to the WTO. We also make no effort to distinguish between support most governments recognize as beneficial when handed to domestic producers — such as ones to lower the price of food and early-stage clean technology — and ones that funnel tax dollars to bloated incumbents. Fossil fuel subsidies, meanwhile, exist in a legal gray area, and have long been immune from the scrutiny given to renewable equipment.China does itself few favours. The dominance of sclerotic state-owned companies and prevalence of off-the-books financing give ample fodder for trade partners looking to justify protectionist restrictions. The sheer scale of the Chinese economy means that other nations tend to view supply-demand mismatches in conspiratorial terms — such as when steel-mill investments ran ahead of output in the years up to 2015, sparking years of complaints and tariffs. The opacity of the Chinese economy allows other nations to cite its competitive advantages as unfair practices.Still, the subsidy-rich Inflation Reduction Act in the US and the EU’s REPowerEU plan both suggest that the world is moving in China’s direction of using the public purse to advance clean energy goals.That’s welcome. Subsidies are just another word for the state using its fiscal might to provide goods that the private sector won’t fund on its own. What’s needed isn’t a blanket ban, but a policy acknowledged by all WTO members that more honestly distinguishes between good and bad uses of such spending. Using state funds to accelerate the energy transition should be no more controversial than paying for other social goods, such as health, education and public security.That would imply not an arms race on tariffs, but instead a policy of mutual disarmament. Some $1.8 trillion will be invested in clean energy and infrastructure this year, the International Energy Agency said this week. To make sure it’s spent wisely, China’s trade partners need to remove the dubious duties and investigations that threaten to stymie the transition, spend on building up their own capacities, and unleash the vast potential at their fingertips.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Regulator proposes new high-risk mutual funds for deep-pocketed investorsThe Securities and Exchange Board of India has sought inputs from the Association of Mutual Funds in India on a proposed new mutual fund category targeted at wealthy investors with high-risk appetite. The proposed category will have relaxed investment norms than typical mutual funds to help affluent investors generate high returns.Why it’s important: Wealthy investors with elevated risk appetite currently go through portfolio managers with a minimum of Rs 50 lakh. The new category of fund houses may have a lower entry threshold.#3. Foreign investors on edge as 10-day window for higher disclosures approachesForeign portfolio investors are apprehensive of the 10-day disclosure window provided for submitting details of beneficial owners in the case of fresh breaches of investment thresholds. A week before the additional disclosure regulations for overseas investors kick in, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has released the standard operating procedure for such custodians.Why it’s important: Although the market regulator has provided clarity on exemptions and formats for granular details, industry players continue to fret over higher disclosures but will have to comply.#4. India’s plans to invest in Rosneft project in Vostok stalled as Us consultants stay offIndia’s plans to invest in a massive Rosneft project in Vostok have stalled as American consultants who conduct third-party studies and due diligence stay off the sanctions-hit Russian Federation. A consortium of state-run firms has completed the technical evaluation of 30 out of 52 license areas of the Vostok project. India is also looking to invest in Russia’s LNG project by purchasing a stake from Novatek.Why it’s important: The absence of expert studies and due diligence by American consultancies is seen as a setback for India’s investment plans. The proposed transactions in Russian projects are important for the country as it is the world’s third-largest oil buyer.#5. Ola Electric raises Rs 3,200 crore to build cell making factory and expand EV businessOla Electric has raised Rs 3,200 crore through an equity fundraise led by existing investor Temasek and project debt from State Bank of India to build a cell manufacturing factory and expand its electric two-wheeler business. The latest fund raising raises the valuation of the firm to around $5 billion.Why it’s important: The fresh funds will provide Ola an additional buffer and a longer runway before its proposed initial public offering. It is now well-positioned to take advantage of the rapid expansion of India’s electric two-wheeler market.#6. Adani looks to raise $4 billion to build low-cost green hydrogen factoriesThe Adani Group is seeking to raise $4 billion to help develop manufacturing plants that would produce low-cost green hydrogen. Adani New Industries, a unit of flagship Adani Enterprises, will take the lead raising the money from domestic and international banks and is in early stage talks with several lenders.Why it’s important: Indian billionaires like Adani and Ambani are betting heavily on green hydrogen after the India government announced ambitious plans to bolster the country energy transiton.#7. Unilever to slash product prices in India, leading to tougher competition to sell soapsUnilever will cut product prices in India in a few categories, such as soaps and laundry, to pass on benefits of lower commodity prices, boost volumes and compete with local entrants. The maker of Lux soap and Surf Excel detergent said the Indian market is seeing a gradual recovery, led by urban areas, but the rural market has remained subdued.Why it’s important: The proposed price cuts by a dominant players will force rivals to follow suit. This could impact margins in the short term although volumes may rebound.#8. Titan to launch high-end retail stores with minimum ticket price of Rs 10 lakhTitan Company is set to launch an invitation only retail store, which will sell luxury jewelry with a minimum ticket size of Rs 10 lakh. It has taken 17,000 sq ft space in New Delhi’s South Extension market for the luxury store.

Titan has seen double-digit growth in ticket sizes, indicating strong demand at higher price points.#9. More than 500 eateries in national capital unable to sell liquor as licenses are delayedMore than 500 bars, restaurants and pubs in the national capital are unable to serve alcohol, the National Restaurant Association of India has estimated. This is because their applications for an excise license are at various stages of pendency with multiple government departments. The delay is at other stages before the applications reach the excise department.Why it’s important: The delay in securing liquor licenses during the peak fest season is bound to hurt the hospitality sector that has seen a modest rebound from the pandemic blues.#10. Rising preference for healthy foods in India post pandemic shows up in inbound shipmentsIndia’s rising preference for healthy foods is showing up in its imports, with a surge in inbound shipments of avocado, dry fruits, buckwheat, and olives, even as those of ice-creams, cakes and confectionery, and salad dressings are declining. There is also more demand for and higher imports of fruits and vegetables, amid a general sway towards natural immunity boosters since the pandemic.Why it’s important: The upper-middle segment of the Indian market, who has the largest number of health-conscious consumers, are driving the shift in imports. It’s only a matter of time till local industry senses an opportunity and produces these goods within the country."

Gautam Adani has said in the past that 75% of the group’s forecast capital expenditure will be in green businesses and his companies plan to invest $20 billion over the next decade in renewables, green component manufacturing and related infrastructure.Tycoons like Adani and his rival Mukesh Ambani are betting on green hydrogen as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to establish India’s leadership in the transition toward cleaner technology.“Green hydrogen holds a strong promise for India’s future energy self-reliance,” Adani’s website states. “It is not too difficult to imagine a scenario where green hydrogen at a price of less than $1/kg — coupled with the projected reduction in the cost of combined cycle hydrogen turbines and fuel cells — will not only allow the country to make a transition from fossil fuels, but also free India from the debilitating financial burden of energy imports.”Adani New Industries will conduct the fresh capital raising independent of Total, the people said. One of the first projects that the money will be put toward is a 1 million metric tons per annum green hydrogen facility being built in Gujarat, they said. Production from that plant is expected to start in 2027.A successful project finance close would demonstrate the ports-to-power conglomerate is winning back the support of lenders after corporate fraud allegations levied in late January by Hindenburg Research. While Adani Group strongly denied the accusations, its bonds and shares plunged and most are yet to reach their prior peaks. A court-mandated probe by India’s market regulator is underway to assess if the conglomerate violated any local securities laws."

He said the demand for automobiles, especially higher segment cars, has surged in India post Covid.""After Covid, the market recovery is very strong (in India) in comparison to other countries so we believe demand itself is very strong in India,"" the company executive said. Bengaluru-based Toyota Kirloskar Motor, a joint venture between Toyota Motor Company and Kirloskar Group, operates two plants with a total production capacity of 3.42 lakh units per annum.With enhanced demand leading to long waiting periods on certain products, the automaker is now looking to set up a third plant in India. Miyazaki said it is a good sign for the automaker that the car market in India has started to witness a gradual increase in acceptance of bigger cars.When asked if the Indian car market moving from small cars to higher segments makes the market more attractive for Toyota, he said, ""With the strength of higher segments going up in the Indian market, it tells us it is now Toyota's time.""TKM has seen a robust increase in demand for its models this year.During April-September period, its sales grew 35 per cent to 1,23,939 units from 91,843 units in the same period of last year.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/adani-auditor-ey-faces-accounting-regulator-inquiry-11599381.html,Adani auditor EY faces accounting regulator inquiry,"October 26, 2023 06:58 AM IST","The regulator has requested files and communications related to its audits on some of the companies controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani going as far back as 2014, the people said.","One of the Adani Group’s longtime auditors is being scrutinized by India’s accounting regulator, according to people familiar with the matter.The National Financial Reporting Authority, or NFRA, has in recent weeks started an inquiry into one of the member firms of EY in India, S.R. Batliboi, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential information. The regulator has requested files and communications related to its audits on some of the companies controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani going as far back as 2014, the people said.It’s unclear how long NFRA’s inquiry may take or what repercussions, if any, may be faced by the auditor and Adani’s companies. Representatives for NFRA didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment. A representative for EY and S.R. Batliboi declined to comment.The scrutiny of S.R. Batliboi — statutory auditor of five listed Adani companies that produce about half of the group’s revenues — underscores the lingering questions around accounting and disclosures by the sprawling conglomerate that faced a brutal short seller attack in January. Adani Group, which has forcefully denied Hindenburg’s allegations of corporate malfeasance, is also under a court-mandated probe by India’s markets regulator.“We strongly reject any suggestion that Adani Group and its businesses have not acted as per the regulations and accounting standards of the jurisdictions in which we operate,” an Adani spokesperson said in a statement. “The Adani Group has always conducted its business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is confident about its practices, governance and disclosures.”Besides being the current auditors for Adani Power Ltd., Adani Green Energy Ltd., the consumer goods firm Adani Wilmar Ltd. and the two cement makers the tycoon acquired from Holcim Ltd. last year, S.R. Batliboi also signed off on the books of Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone Ltd., the conglomerate’s crown jewel, for a decade leading to 2017.Indian law prohibits foreign accounting firms from registering as auditors in the country. That’s why Big Four firms including EY operate through independently run affiliates.Hindenburg raised questions over Adani’s accounting and audits in a January report that erased more than $150 billion in market value at one point from the conglomerate’s listed companies.The group said in a Jan. 29 rebuttal that its firms are audited by “duly certified and qualified” professionals.But months later, changes followed. Adani Total Gas Ltd. on May 2 announced the appointment of Walker Chandiok & Co LLP as its new statutory auditor. It replaced Shah Dhandharia & Co., a longtime auditor of several Adani companies, which Hindenburg had said was simply too small to handle such big assignments. Shah Dhandharia said it resigned because of “pre-occupation.”Shied AwayLater that month, Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP raised concerns over insufficient disclosures around Adani Ports’s transactions with some entities, before resigning in August.Some auditors, wary of the conglomerate’s aggressive and debt-fueled expansion, have in recent years shied from taking on the group’s companies as clients, Bloomberg News reported in June.S.R. Batliboi’s longest-running current Adani Group assignment is with Adani Power, where it has flagged several accounting matters, particularly over the valuation of a massive loss-making plant, for five years starting 2018. Each year, while the company acknowledged the auditor’s concerns, it went ahead with its own valuation of the plant. Such a long-running disagreement is unusual, Bloomberg News reported in March.NFRA, which was formed in 2018 to oversee India’s auditors, has emerged as an aggressive enforcer of both laws and professional standards governing the accounting industry. The agency can issue fines, and debar both audit firms and individual auditors for as long as a decade. Over the past five years, it has debarred more than 40 people.S.R. Batliboi previously brushed with NFRA in the wake of an accounting scandal at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., an infrastructure developer, in 2018.Last year, the regulator said that S.R. Batliboi, which had audited the books of IL&FS, had failed to comply with basic audit requirements, and been unqualified for that role because EY simultaneously had provided non-audit services to the company."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/it-slowdown-a-playbook-for-the-class-of-2024-11594261.html,IT Slowdown: A playbook for the class of 2024,"October 25, 2023 01:00 PM IST",Net new hiring in Indian IT firms may continue to fall but the demand for technology talent is still high in a range of sectors and companies. Here's what the engineering batch of 2024 should do,"Most reputable engineering institutions have had it easy for long. With a sprinkling of large IT services companies hiring in bulk, the majority of students in every batch managed to secure placements within the first few weeks of campus recruitment. More importantly, the promise of global exposure and cutting-edge work in these companies lured waves of students from across disciplines of study – civil, mechanical, metallurgy, plastics and ceramics, biotechnology, printing, geology, and so on. For placement officers, the real effort to place students was limited to a small cohort of students. It was a buyer’s market.Now, with continued weakness in discretionary spending, dipping attrition, surging employee utilisation, and growing adoption of automation and AI to drive up productivity, net new hiring across large IT companies has been in a free fall. This has led to headlines screaming about massive dips in headcount, record lows in net staff addition, and mounting uncertainty for fresh graduates. It’s clearly a seller’s market today.What does this mean for engineering graduates of the class of 2024? How can they bloom amidst the gloom? As someone who has watched this industry evolve from both sides – industry and academia, I am tempted to make a few suggestions.Mine Market Intelligence On Who’s Hiring, Who’s Not Despite some large IT recruiters going slow, all hell has not broken loose. Many others – mid-sized companies, product and platform companies, Global Captive Centres (GCCs), born-digital companies, startups and IT departments of Indian corporations – are continuing to hire, some in large numbers. It’s important to get granular intelligence on who’s hiring and who’s not.While GCCs of financial services companies continue to lead the way in hiring, companies across manufacturing, defence, pharma, biotech, medical devices, media and entertainment, and Internet sectors – transitioning from inception to growth – are driving more broad-based hiring.It is estimated that the more than 1,500 GCCs in India will hire over 300,000 professionals this year, a sizeable share of them from campuses. A quick company and sub-industry analysis of the GCCs listed in the recent NASSCOM-ZINNOV report can help figure out the nuances in hiring.Go Beyond Traditional Technology Software And Services In recent years, companies in newer industries – such as energy, semiconductors, aviation, defence and medical devices – have made a beeline for Indian talent in core technology R&D, design, development and manufacturing.A good example is Hitachi Energy that recently established its largest global technology and innovation centre in India and plans to hire over 2,500 energy technologists in areas of grid automation, transformers and grid integration. This is a huge opportunity for students pursuing electrical, electronics, energy, environment and related engineering disciplines.There are many similar opportunities for students of electronics and communication, biotechnology, biomedical, chemical, civil, architecture, mechanical, production, instrumentation, and related disciplines, looking to build careers in areas as diverse as electric vehicles (EV), 5G, edge computing, industrial IoT, additive manufacturing, 3D printing, robotics, genomics, smart devices and implantables, to name a few.Opportunities In IT Departments Of Indian CompaniesWith digital becoming the underlying strategic imperative for differentiation and growth, every company wants to “own” these capabilities – rather than “lease” them – to drive innovation in their business, operating and financial models.Many large, mid-sized and small Indian companies are investing heavily in their in-house IT departments, creating significant opportunities in all areas of digital – mobile development, analytics, IoT, cybersecurity, virtual reality, and the like.These companies can provide students with opportunities to work closely with all aspects of the business, co-locating and co-innovating with different functions.Get Certified In High-Growth Technology Areas With cloud becoming the de facto technology infrastructure and human experience becoming central to any device or application, we have seen a proliferation of as-a-service platforms. Despite the not-so-benign economic environment, companies such as Salesforce, ServiceNow, Adobe, Workday, among others, are growing at a rapid clip. Badges and certifications in these platforms are passports to well-paying first jobs.It is important to note that there is still an acute shortage of qualified talent in high-growth areas such as cybersecurity, data science and ESG/sustainability. Different research reports put the shortage of these critical skills in the range of a few millions. Cybersecurity certifications from the likes of ISACA, GSEC, ISC and GIAC, for example, can be a great career booster.Further, with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, opportunities for data science professionals are likely to explode. With massive need for data consent managers, data processors, data fiduciaries and privacy specialists, every company, irrespective of its size, will need skilled professionals to navigate the complexities of data governance and ensure compliance with newer regulations.It's All About Technology, Stupid! Despite all the uncertainty in the air, one thing is certain – this pullback in campus hiring will only be a short-term phenomenon. Every industry in the world is becoming more technology-intensive and not less.As such, once global economies get back to their buoyant ways, the combined hiring of companies of all hues is bound to be much higher than historical numbers. The reason is simple.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/ozempic-is-spoiling-the-food-industrys-bottomless-brunch-11572181.html,Ozempic is spoiling the food industry’s bottomless brunch,"October 20, 2023 03:51 PM IST",Investors fear the rise of weight-loss drugs eating into their profits. But companies from Nestle to PepsiCo aren’t panicking yet,"Jimmy Kimmel propelled weight-loss drugs into our popularconsciousness in March, when he quipped at the Oscars: “Everybody looks so great. When I look around this room I can’t help but wonder: Is Ozempic right for me?”It’s hard to say. But Novo Nordisk A/S’s GLP-1 Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, as well as other appetite-suppressing medications, don’t look so right for the global food industry. Earlier this month, the head of Walmart Inc’s US operation, John Furner, told Bloomberg News that people taking them were eating less. “We do see a slight pullback in overall basket,” he said. “Just less units, slightly less calories.”It wasn’t just Walmart investors who balked at the comments. Food manufacturers’ stocks tumbled. PepsiCo Inc, Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc, The Hershey Co and Kellanova — the company behind Pringles and Cheez-It — are all still trading below their year-to-date averages. Shares in Nestle SA, the world’s biggest food company, are at their lowest level in two and a half years, reflecting the weakest sales growth it’s seen for almost three years.But the knee-jerk reaction to Furner’s comment was overdone. Investors are overestimating the scale of adoption of weight-loss drugs as well as how consumers might change their eating habits. Most importantly, they’re discounting how food companies might adapt. They could reformulate products and restructure portfolios, reducing their exposure to junk food and offering healthier alternatives.Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that by 2035, about 7 percent of the US population, or 24 million people, could be treated with anti-obesity medication, amounting to a 1.3 percent reduction in calories consumed. The impact on sugary drinks, baked goods and salty snacks could be more extreme, with a 2.5 percent to 3 percent fall in consumption compared with a scenario of  no widespread use of the drugs.This looks like a treacherous headwind for the packaged-food industry, which is already struggling to lift the volume of goods sold. But it does not tell the whole story.There are still questions about just how widespread these treatments will be. American insurance companies are already battling to deny coverage of the drugs because of their high costs, and the US Congress is debatingwhether Medicare should cover them. Without insurance coverage, it’s unlikely most people would be able to shell out some $1,300 a month for Wegovy or even $900 a month for Ozempic. Analysts at Bernstein suggest only 20 percent-30 percent of people are able to stick with the regimen a year after starting them. (Most of the fear is concentrated in the US right now, but Wegovy was recently introduced in the UK — at a fraction of the US cost — and is also available in Norway, Denmark and Germany.)Consuming fewer calories doesn’t necessarily mean buying less either. A recent panel organized by Bernstein analysts found that those taking the drugs had a desire to eat more healthily. Yet it’s possible they actually spend more from adding pricier fresh food to their baskets. Jennifer Bartashus, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, points out that these health concerns aren’t new either. Companies such as Nestle, Mondelez and Hershey have been looking to make their products healthier for some time, reducing sugar and producing smaller, low-calorie packs, for example.Foods giants so far seem unfazed. Despite its size, Nestle is less at risk than many rivals because it has been cutting back on mainstream groceries, having sold its US confectionery business to Ferrero SpA in 2018. However, about 15 percent of its sales could be affected by lower demand due to weight-loss drugs since it still sells frozen food in the US, confectionery in other parts of the world and some ice cream, although the bulk of its exposure to this category is through a joint venture. Chief Executive Officer Mark Schneider said on Thursday that it was not seeing any effect on sales so far. This echoes comments from PepsiCo, which said the impact was “negligible.”Meanwhile, Ozempic and its ilk could even bring some opportunities. If people taking them still want to indulge, they may eat a smaller amount of chocolate, for example, but trade up to a more expensive product. This would benefit Nestle and Mondelez, which have been moving their portfolios more upmarket. Mondelez has been on a buying frenzy over the last five years, snapping up companies from premium cookie brand Tate’s Bake Shop to minimally processed, high-quality snack company Hu. And Nestle recently acquired a majority stake in Grupo CRM, a premium chocolate-maker in Brazil. About 35 percent of the Swiss company’s sales are in premium categories — three times what they were a decade ago.Some foods may get a boost from widespread adoption of the drugs by health-conscious consumers. One of the challenges of rapid weight loss is maintaining muscle mass. Eating enough healthy protein is crucial. Analysts at Barclays point out that this could benefit French food company Danone SA, whose portfolio of enhanced protein yoghurts and yogurt drinks currently generates sales of about €500 million ($527 million). This could easily double, they predict. Nestle also sells protein supplements through its Health Science arm and is working on other products to complement the weight-loss treatments.Snacking has been one of the fastest-growing categories in food, though, so a switch away from certain items could be a drag and lead to lots of disposals. With slower growth, these business could be appetising to private equity groups, more interested in cash generation than sales expansion. Similarly, there could be a dash by the manufacturers for healthier brands, sparking a wave of pricey M&A.Of course there are bigger risks, such as Wegovy uptake growing faster than expected. Already, users sometimes lose their appetite for alcohol. Indigestion and nausea, side effects from the treatments, could impact demand for coffee too. And what about our obese pets — will they eventually be put on Ozempic? The latter two scenarios would be far more worrying for Nestle: Together, pet food and coffee account for about 45 percent of sales.Fortunately, right now that sounds far-fetched. Although these drugs are a legitimate long-term concern, the food companies have enough going for them to help investors lose some of the weight of their worries.Andrea Felsted is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering consumer goods and the retail industry. Leticia Miranda is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering consumer goods and the retail industry. Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.Credit: Bloomberg "

Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google’s parent Alphabet, announced that his company’s first made-in-India Pixel devices will be rolled out in early 2024. Google’s decision to make its smartphones in the country follows the start of its Chromebook production in India earlier this month in partnership with HP.Why it’s important: The latest decision by Google will provide a significant boost to India’s ambitions to emerge as a global electronics manufacturing hub. It will become the latest global phonemaker after Apple and Samsung to build its flagship devices in the country.#2. Government will not restrict imports of computer hardware productsThe Indian government has announced it will not restrict import of laptops and other IT hardware products, while unveiling a new contactless import authorization system. It had earlier said it was planning to bring several IT hardware products under the restricted label as part of attempts to ensure a trusted supply chain and reduce import dependence on China. Now, import permits will be issued in an online format and the process will require less than 10 minutes to complete. Importers will be allowed to apply for multiple authorizations and receive custom clearances.Why it’s important: The latest development lays to rest apprehensions that India could be going back to the license raj. Major makers of computer hardware will be relived.#3. High-frequency indicators show rise in economic momentum, says Reserve BankIndia’s high-frequency indicators are pointing to a broad-based increase in momentum although surging yields and rising crude oil prices have emerged as immediate risks to global growth, according to an article in Reserve Bank of India’s October bulletin. Deleveraging and higher capacity utilization have enabled capital-heavy industries to gain traction, the article said.Why it’s important: The Reserve Bank’s monetary policy actions and continued disinflationary stance of withdrawing accommodation seem to be yielding results, but it is too early to declare victory.#4. Consumer goods firms report robust urban sales growth in September quarterIndia’s packaged consumer goods companies have reported robust urban growth in the September quarter, marked particularly by consumer preferences for premium products although demand in rural markets remained subdued. Earnings of Hindustan Unilever underscored the resilience of urban markets despite lingering effects of the pandemic. Similarly, Nestle India has reported double-digit growth. ITC has reported robust growth as well.Why it’s important: In what would bring smiles to FMCG boardrooms, urban markets are showing a marked demand for premium products where margins are higher. Rural demand remains subdued though.#5. Byju’s in initial talks with Bain and KKR to ssell controlling stake in AakashByju Raveendran, CEO of Byju’s, has held exploratory talks with Bain Capital and KKR, among others, to discuss the sale of a controlling stake in Aakash Educational Services. Some private equity firms such as Carlyle are open to backing Aakash Chaudhry, former CEO and part of the family that founded Aakash, to buy back the company.Why it’s important: The development marks an interesting twist to the proposed sale of Aakash by Byju’s to raise money to retire part of its debt. India’s most valuable unicorn seems to be juggling multiple balls to grapple with a repayment crisis.#6. India’s agricultural output likely to grow by over 3 percent in 2023-24Farm output is expected to grow by more than 3 percent in the current financial year despite initial concerns about the adverse impact of an erratic monsoon, government think tank NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand has said. A 3 percent increase in farm output would mean a moderation from the 3.5 percent growth in gross value added in 2022-23 and the 4 percent growth seen in the year before.Why it’s important: It is now certain that the uneven southwest monsoon and the El Nino weather pattern will scrimp India’s farm output. Food prices might soften a bit after the harvest comes in.#7. Government must notify treaty benefits for overseas companies to avail lower taxThe Supreme Court has said the lower 5 percent withholding tax on dividend income of companies was not available to all Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries just on the most favored nation basis. A bench led by Justice Ravindra Bhatt held that international treaty practices are not enforceable in India unless the government notifies them.Why it’s important: The ruling is likely to have wide ramifications for industry and could result in millions of dollars of additional tax revenue for the government.#8. Adani Group set to refinance $3.5 billion debt taken to buy Ambuja-ACCThe Adani Group is set to sign a definitive agreement to refinance $3.5 billion in loans taken for 2022’s acquisition of ACC and Ambuja Cement. At least 18 global banks have agreed to join the consortium led by Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered to refinance the debt. As part of new terms, the promoter Adani family will prepay around $300 million.Why it’s important: The debt had helped fund the biggest M&A in India’s cement industry. The latest agreement will be the largest refinancing exercise across Asia Pacific in the current financial year.#9. SoftBank to slash stake in Zomato, plans full exits from food-delivery platformSoftBank fund SVF Growth Singapore will sell at least 1.1 percent stake in food-delivery and restaurant-discovery firm Zomato for around Rs 1,020 crore this week, even as the Japanese venture capitalist plans a full exit from the food delivery business. Over the past one year, Zomato’s stock price has risen by 80 percent to Rs 111.65 from Rs 62.05.Why it’s important: SoftBank’s decision to sell stake in Zomato follows the platform’s dramatic rise in market price over the past one year.#10. Female participation in blue-collar jobs increasing across manufacturing sectorIndia’s current female blue-collar workforce participation is at 8 percent, or one in 12, a significant rise from less than 2 per cent a couple of decades ago, according to Deloitte’s Blue Collar Workforce Trends Report 2023. The life sciences, automotive, and engineering design are sectors that are leading in gender diversity ratio on account of their high degree of automation, skilled talent requirement and premium pay. The study covered 104 organizations and more than 300 factories.Why it’s important: Women’s participation in India’s workforce has been worrying low for quite some time. Although it seems to be increasing in the manufacturing sector, a lot more ground needs to be covered."

The deal will comprise three tenors: 6-month, 18-month and 3-year, as Bloomberg News had previously reported.An Adani Group representative didn’t immediately respond to an email outside of business hours in India.The financing comes after months of negotiations with banks and follows allegations of fraud by US shortseller Hindenburg Research that caused the company’s bonds and shares to plunge earlier in the year. Adani has strongly denied those claims.The group’s flagship firm already raised 12.5 billion rupees ($151 million) by issuing local-currency bonds in July, as the company sought to put the Hindenburg claims behind it."

Each has a 13.3-inch screen for inflight entertainment, including live news and sport broadcasts, and a polished wood cocktail table.Passenger traffic between India and the United Arab Emirates stood at 4.7 million people in the quarter through June.Emirates first launched its premium economy offering in August 2022. It’s already available on flights to London, Sydney, Auckland, Christchurch, Melbourne, Singapore, Los Angeles, New York, Houston and San Francisco.The service will also be deployed on Sao Paulo and Tokyo flights before the end of 2023, the airline said Thursday."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/breastfeeding-at-workplace-remains-taboo-despite-growing-narrative-around-inclusion-11563311.html,Breastfeeding at workplace remains taboo despite growing narrative around inclusion,"October 19, 2023 03:50 PM IST","While regulation in India specifically governing lactating mothers aims at indirect facilitation through crèche services, the West often focuses on direct breastfeeding or pumping facilities, law experts say.","DevOps engineer Mudita Chauhan* has to travel to her home to breastfeed her baby on a daily basis. It's not that her workplace doesn't provide a crèche facility. But the poor infrastructure and sheer discomfort makes it almost impossible for Chauhan to visit it daily.However, when Chauhan and a few colleagues facing a similar situation requested their human resources business partner (HRBP) for the establishment of a lactation room at the workplace, the reply never came.The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act of 2017 mandates that every establishment with 50 or more employees should provide a crèche facility within a prescribed distance. This indirectly facilitates breastfeeding mothers to ensure their infants receive adequate nourishment. The act also permits women to visit the crèche four times daily, which includes her interval for rest.But Western countries, like the US under the Fair Labor Standards Act, require employers to provide reasonable break time and a private non-bathroom space for nursing mothers to express breast milk for a year after the child’s birth, according to Sonal Alagh, partner at Alagh & Kapoor Law Offices.The key takeaway is that while India’s law aims at indirect facilitation through crèche services, the West often focuses on direct breastfeeding or pumping facilities.The challengesSetting up breastfeeding rooms in the workplace in India can be a challenging endeavour for many companies due to various social, cultural and logistical factors. While there has been some progress in recent years in recognising the importance of supporting working mothers, numerous hurdles persist.A 2023 Avtar & Seramount BCWI-MICI study of 350 Indian companies found that 86 percent of them provide pumping rooms but only 30 percent offer lactation support programmes—resource and referral support via lactation consultants and agencies for guidance on the breastfeeding journey.A pumping room is primarily for expressing breast milk using a pump, while a breastfeeding room is designed for direct breastfeeding but can also accommodate pumping if necessary. The challengesWhile citing a 2018 Medela study that stated only 33 percent of companies offer a designated nursing room for women to express breast milk, HR firm KelpHR said this number is still reflective of the current number of companies that offer breastfeeding facilities/rooms at the workplace.Setting up a breastfeeding room requires financial investment and sufficient space. Smaller or financially constrained companies may find it challenging to allocate resources for this purpose.“It has to be a room with a comfortable seating facility for one or two breastfeeding mothers at a time, and a refrigerator to store the breast milk. That is the basic minimum organisations can do and this is doable even in the smallest of companies,” said Smita Shetty Kapoor, CEO and co-founder of KelpHR, adding that in the event that the firm doesn’t have any employees who are pregnant/breastfeeding, the room can be used as a multipurpose room.However, post-Covid implications have their play in this matter. With remote and hybrid working models becoming a norm, many employees themselves have opted for a crèche facility closer to their residence than one at the office. As a result, many organisations that had crèche facilities in their offices have wound them down.“But not having a crèche does not negate breastfeeding. However, now with the number of offices with crèches dwindling, breastfeeding support is also negligible,” said Sonica Aron, founder and managing partner of HR consultancy Marching Sheep.Cultural issueIndia has a conservative cultural background, and breastfeeding in public or at the workplace is often seen as taboo. Some employees and employers may still hold traditional views, making it difficult for women to openly discuss their needs for a breastfeeding room.The workplace culture plays a significant role in supporting breastfeeding mothers. An unsupportive or judgemental work environment can discourage women from utilising the breastfeeding room or expressing milk during work hours.Without a proper space to express milk, working mothers may have to take breaks in less-than-ideal locations or times, disrupting their work. This can lead to reduced productivity and efficiency, creating a lose-lose situation for both the employee and the employer. Cultural issueSaundarya Rajesh, founder-president of Avtar Group, a diversity solutions firm, said it is important for organisations to activate forums/channels through which such needs can be raised. This may include employee resource groups (ERGs) or women’s networks/councils.“Women leaders have a crucial role to play in this. They can ensure that spotlight on the need for support is communicated at the leadership level, which will work towards normalising support around breastfeeding,” she said.Know your rightsMothers who are unable to breastfeed or express milk at work may face the difficult decision of either leaving their jobs or taking extended leaves of absence. This can result in talent loss for companies and increased absenteeism.However, industry experts say women should have to know their rights and ask for it. For instance, the breastfeeding facilities at the workplace mandated under the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act.Moreover, employees have to determine which state laws and provisions apply to the workplace as different states in India may have additional rules and regulations related to breastfeeding facilities.As a start, employees must collect information about the company's policies and practices regarding breastfeeding facilities, if available. This can include reviewing the employee handbook, speaking with HR, or consulting with colleagues who may have faced similar situations.More important is to put the request in writing.“Formalise your request by drafting a well-structured letter addressed to your employer. Outline your lactation plan, including the frequency and duration of breastfeeding breaks required. Specify any facilities or accommodations you need, such as a private lactation room with proper amenities,” KelpHR’s Kapoor said.Working mothers must brainstorm with their colleagues and offer potential solutions that make it easier for the company to comply with the request. For example, suggest the use of an existing room that can be converted into a breastfeeding room with minimal cost.“If your employer is unresponsive or unwilling to provide the necessary facilities, you may seek assistance from labour authorities or relevant government departments responsible for enforcing labour laws,” said Kritika Seth, founding partner at Victoriam Legalis."

More importantly, LIC is trading at a 33% discount to the issue price and 27% to the listing price, cancelling out any possibility of a follow on public issue, for now.The government is now likely to come out with a longer/extended exemption for the Corporation from MPS norms, beyond the five years given by SEBI, keeping the market regulator's guidelines in context. The extension of exemption is likely to fall under SCRA rules (Securities Contract Regulation Act), which empowers government to exempt CPSEs from MPS for a specified period.Earlier this year, the government had amended the SCRA rules, which gives it the right to tweak public float timelines for CPSEs , without a SEBI nod."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/financial-institutions-will-pay-a-heavy-price-for-ignoring-risks-11545721.html,Financial institutions will pay a heavy price for ignoring risks,"October 17, 2023 11:57 AM IST","The relentless push for innovation has given rise to complex systems and interconnected networks, making them susceptible to cyberattacks and data breaches. When a non-bank tele-caller knows more about your bank transaction than you do, it is a stark reminder that the walls of consumer privacy and data security are crumbling","The business of finance is simply pricing the risks. But then, financial institutions often find themselves navigating treacherous waters, seemingly blind to the lurking risks; especially with newer and emerging risks. While they may pay lip service to risk management, especially with regulatory nudge and market optics, many institutions still fail to invest in the full expertise and proactive measures required to safeguard their operations. This is evident from multiple incidents in the Indian scenario that have prompted financial regulators like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to step in and caution the entities or even ask them not to onboard newer customers. Be it technology or digital-based regulatory concerns that the RBI had at the HDFC Bank or the Bank of Baroda, or many other entities it regulates, it underscores the need for a more proactive and vigilant stance on digital risks. A partial risk solution is actually no solution.In an era dominated by emerging technologies, the risks have taken on new dimensions. The advent of cyber advancements, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and fintech innovations has brought unprecedented opportunities but also vulnerabilities. These technologies have created a dynamic environment where risks can materialise at lightning speed, catching even the most venerable institutions off guard. Be it identity theft, phishing, know-your-customer (KYC) challenges, cyberattacks or ransomware, risks abound.Hurts Consumers, Investors Believing that risks are reserved for others is the most perilous risk of all. It's a dangerous cocktail of negligence and arrogance. Financial institutions especially the banks, once regarded as bastions of trust, seem increasingly willing to cut corners when it comes to risk mitigation. The allure of immediate profits often blinds them to the reality that, in today's interconnected world, the domino effect of a single misstep can be devastating. The true cost of this recklessness is borne not by the institutions themselves, but by the consumers and investors who place their faith and finances in their hands. When the inevitable disaster strikes, it's the ordinary individuals who bear the brunt of the fallout. Savings disappear, investments crumble and the very foundations of trust erode. The excuses of ""unforeseeable events"" or ""unprecedented circumstances"" no longer hold water in a world where information flows at the speed of light.Despite the proliferation of newer and more complex risks in the financial sector, coupled with repeated calls from financial regulators for enhanced risk management, it remains an unfortunate reality that financial institutions often remain inert until a painful lesson is learned. This reactive approach to risk mitigation, where substantive changes are only spurred by the tangible consequences of a risk event, underscores a systemic complacency that can have dire repercussions. The financial regulators have to step up penal actions on their regulated entities, by punishing them with high penalties and stopping them from doing business until those identified risks have been plugged.The reluctance to proactively invest in preventive risk management and resilience measures until an industry peer or the institution itself faces severe consequences is a risky gamble that the banking sector can ill afford in today's rapidly evolving financial landscape. A more prudent and forward-thinking approach, guided by a commitment to pre-emptive risk management, is not just a regulatory mandate but a strategic imperative for financial institutions to thrive in an increasingly uncertain world.Constant Vigilance Required In an era where technology has the power to both empower and endanger, financial institutions must embrace a culture of constant vigilance. They must stay ahead of emerging risks, adapt swiftly to changing landscapes, and uphold the trust that underpins their existence. In the age of digital transformation, financial institutions face a myriad of tech-based risks. The relentless push for innovation has given rise to complex systems and interconnected networks, making them susceptible to cyberattacks and data breaches. When a non-bank tele-caller knows more about your bank transaction than you do, it is a stark reminder that the walls of consumer privacy and data security are crumbling.Emerging technologies introduce a new layer of risks. While innovations like blockchain and artificial intelligence hold great promise, they also bring unknown vulnerabilities. Smart contracts, for instance, can inadvertently encode flaws that lead to substantial losses, while AI algorithms can make biased or erroneous decisions that impact financial stability.Banks, in their quest to fortify their defences against ever-evolving cyber threats, require risk management expertise that transcends theoretical knowledge. To effectively counteract the relentless innovation of bad actors, financial institutions must engage experts who have not only studied the intricacies of risk but have also delved into the minds of those who create these risks in the first place. By embracing practitioners who can simulate the tactics and strategies of the most sophisticated hackers, banks gain a unique advantage. To stop a cyberattack, it's essential to think like the best hacker ever. Only by understanding the mindset and methodologies of adversaries can banks hope to develop robust, pre-emptive strategies that safeguard their digital assets and, more importantly, the trust of their clients.Despite the remarkable strides in technology, human risks remain a persistent and underestimated challenge. Behind every line of code and every transaction, there are humans making decisions. Behavioural biases, insider threats and human errors can still lead to catastrophic outcomes. Overlooking the human factor in risk management can prove costly, as the allure of shortcuts and lapses in judgment can undermine even the most advanced technological defences.In the end, the choice is clear. Financial institutions can either rise to the occasion or risk becoming relics of an era when trust was abundant and risks were ignored.Srinath Sridharan is author, policy researcher and corporate advisor.

Chawla expects to see a gradual recovery in Zee and Sun TV's advertising revenue, as FMCG companies have started ramping up spending, while new-age companies remain under pressure","The drop in ad spends by categories such as edtech, fintech, foodtech and e-commerce is posing a challenge for the broadcast industry, which saw its revenues for the September quarter hit by the weak ad environment.Zee’s advertising revenue in the September quarter of FY24 is estimated to grow sequentially on a weak base in Q1 FY24, but will decline on a year-on-year basis (YoY) basis, said Pulkit Chawla, analyst, Emkay Global Financial Services.Zee Entertainment’s ad revenues are expected to be at Rs 977.1 crore in Q2 FY24 versus its reported ad revenue of Rs 940.9 crore. The company had reported Rs 1,012.8 crore in ad revenues in Q2 FY23.Chawla expects Sun TV to report a small uptick of 2 percent YoY in its advertising revenue. The broadcaster is expected to record Rs 351.4 crore in ad revenues in Q2 FY24 as compared to Rs 344.5 crore in Q2 FY23 and Rs 341.1 crore in Q1 FY24.“There will be sustained pressure on growth, particularly in advertising revenues, which are expected to remain flat, said Abhishek Jain, Head of Research, Arihant Capital.Some respiteThe second half of FY24 is expected to bring some respite, thanks to the onset of the festive season and the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Chawla expects to see a gradual recovery in Zee’s and Sun TV's advertising revenue, as FMCG companies have started ramping up spending, while new-age companies remain under pressure.The ongoing ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2023 is expected to increase advertising expenditure during the festive season by 12-15 percent from last year. The cricket tournament is estimated to record over Rs 1,000 crore in ad spends on TV.“While Zee Entertainment’s performance is likely to be impacted by continued weakness in the ad environment, the windfall from (the film) Gadar 2, which is co-produced by Zee Studios, should aid performance in Q2 FY24,” said Jinesh Joshi – Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher.Gadar 2, which released in theatres on August 11, has recorded worldwide collections of over Rs 690 crore.“For Sun TV, the absence of Indian Premier League revenue is likely to drag total revenue quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), which will partly be offset by revenue from Jailer,” said an Elara Capital note. The film earned around Rs 650 crore.Sun TV Network owns SunRisers Hyderabad and the cricket franchise contributes to company's overall revenues earned through central pool revenue of the league. SRH had accounted for 7 percent of the company's total revenue in FY23. In the June quarter of FY24, the company reported 10.38 percent increase in revenue including revenue from IPL franchise.Subscription revenueSome uptick in subscription revenue on a sequential basis is expected for the two broadcasters as the September quarter had the full impact of New Tariff Order 3.0 (NTO 3.0). Zee’s subscription revenue is expected to be at Rs 869.9 crore in Q2 FY24 versus Rs 821.9 crore in Q2 FY23 and Rs 907.5 crore in Q1 FY24.Sun TV is estimated to report subscription revenues of Rs 446.7 crore in Q2 FY24 versus Rs 421 crore in Q2 FY23 and Rs 461 crore in Q1 FY24.Zee’s total revenue is expected to come in at Rs 2,197 crore in Q2 FY24, up by 8 percent on a YOY basis and 11 percent on a QoQ basis.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/cxo-median-compensation-rise-slows-to-12-in-fy23-ntpc-records-highest-growth-report-11540201.html,CXO median compensation rise slows to 12% in FY23; NTPC records highest growth: Report,"October 16, 2023 02:13 PM IST","The upper echelons fared better than the lower ranks, though, with the average employee pay rise coming in at just 7-8 percent, showed a study.","Reflecting the challenges the Indian economy has faced due to global headwinds, FY23 saw an increase of 12.5 percent in median executive compensation compared to 24 percent in FY22 at India’s top 30 listed companies by market capitalisation for the last three years., shows data put together exclusively for Moneycontrol by consulting firm CIEL HR.However, further estimations indicate that the average employee salary experienced grew just 7-8 percent in FY23 and 8-9 percent during FY22. CXOs include the president, CEO, managing director, CFO, COO, CHRO, etc.Median compensation refers to the middle value of all compensation packages within a specific group or organisation. It is the point at which half of the employees' compensation packages falls below that value and half fall above it. In other words, it is the middle point when all compensation figures are arranged in ascending/descending order.Median compensation is often used as a measure of central tendency in salary data because it is less sensitive to extremely high or low outliers compared to the mean (average) compensation. It provides a more representative picture of what a typical employee earns within a particular company or industry. Median salaries of CXOs in the top 30 listed Indian companies by market capitalisationCIEL studied the CXO compensation of the top 30 listed companies by market capitalisation for the last three years. This list includes companies like Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Life Insurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India (SBI), JSW Steel, Asian Paints, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and Avenue Supermarts, among others, and comprises companies across industry sectors.“FY22 saw an increase over 2021 in terms of CXO compensation, reflecting the recovery our economy showed from the early shocks of Covid-19 in FY21. But the slump in executive compensation FY23 showed the challenges our economy has faced due to the global headwinds,” Aditya Narayan Mishra, MD and CEO of CIEL HR, told Moneycontrol.He said the tapering off in median CEO compensation growth by 12 percent is largely attributable to the variable component of executive salaries being closely tied to company performance. The prevailing economic slowdown and a reduced number of projects have, in turn, led to an overall decrease in executive compensation hikes.Simultaneously, Mishra said that recognising the need for fairness in these challenging times, leaders have prioritised increasing employee compensation to boost morale, ensure retention and underscore their commitment to equity and employee satisfaction, thereby balancing the economic challenges faced by the organisation.NTPC tops growth, JSW lagsIn the study, two public sector undertakings bucked the trend. NTPC recorded the highest growth in terms of median salaries for CXOs at 34 percent in FY23 and 24 percent in FY22, followed by Coal India at 18 percent in FY23, reversing a decrease in salaries by 15 percent in FY22.Among private companies, IT major TCS registered the highest growth of 7 percent in FY23 followed by Reliance Industries at 6 percent.JSW Steel and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) were at the other end of the spectrum, with median pay actually falling by 49 percent and 12 percent, respectively.However, JSW still offers the highest median salaries to its CXOs, more than Rs 24.70 crore per annum. In FY22, the median salaries of CXOs at JSW grew by 77 percent and at L&T by 96 percent.“Historically, executives in these organisations (JSW and L&T) have enjoyed substantial compensation compared to their counterparts, positioning these companies at the forefront of offering competitive salaries. However, the recent economic slowdown has impacted their compensation, particularly in terms of bonuses and variable pay, reflecting the broader economic challenges faced by these industries,” Mishra said. Top 5 companies offering the highest median salaries to CXOsDespite the slower growth in FY23, the median CXO salary for the top five by pay offered stood at over Rs 24.37 crore.In absolute terms NTPC, Power Grid Corporation of India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Coal India and SBI—all from the public sector—featured among the companies offering the lowest median salaries to their CXOs, at Rs 80 lakh per annum.However, it's important to note that there are exceptions, and compensation in some PSUs can still be relatively competitive. Additionally, the compensation landscape in India can change over time, and some PSUs have made efforts to align their compensation practices more closely with those of the private sector to attract and retain top talent.

They can also be used to power household appliances if a customer wants to do so,"" one of the company officials told PTI.""It's a whole ecosystem. We have battery and solar power. Customers will basically have to store this energy in batteries which are swappable,"" he said.A user can ideally have more than one battery and swap it when required.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/spotlight-still-on-vedanta-3-billion-debt-despite-spinoff-plan-11479501.html,Spotlight still on Vedanta $3 billion debt despite spinoff plan,"October 05, 2023 07:10 AM IST",A streamlined structure could also help Agarwal sell unprofitable or low-growth assets — something the billionaire has long avoided.,"Billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources Ltd. is on a quest for cash. The junk-rated mining conglomerate has approached investors to restructure about $3 billion worth of bonds due in 2024 and 2025, while splitting its sprawling group to unlock better value for individual businesses. But debt investors aren’t convinced, and the group’s dollar bonds are tumbling.What is the plan for overhauling the group?Indian unit Vedanta Ltd. last week approved a plan to separate its business into six listed companies: aluminum, oil and gas, power, steel and ferrous, base metals and an incubator for new businesses including semiconductors. The reorganization is meant to give investors direct exposure to a business of their choice and improve the value of the group’s component parts.A streamlined structure could also help Agarwal sell unprofitable or low-growth assets — something the billionaire has long avoided.Vedanta expects to complete the transaction by the financial year ending March 2025.What’s the state of Vedanta’s finances?The conglomerate has bond repayments of $3.2 billion coming up over the next two years. About $2 billion of notes are to be redeemed in 2024 —  half of which is due as early as January — and another $1.2 billion in 2025, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Company representatives have proposed to pay back a portion in cash, with the remainder of the principal deferred for three years from the original due date. The plan has met with some opposition.In order to pay back bonds, Vedanta Resources also started talks with lenders such as Cerberus Capital Management LP for a private loan of $1 billion. But the proposal to split up Vedanta Ltd. has complicated the effort.Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings have already downgraded Vedanta Resources deeper into junk.What’s Agarwal saying?The Vedanta Chairman told CNBC-TV18 on Tuesday that the group had lined up money for repayment of the 2024 bonds and that an announcement was due soon. If the terms were favorable, Vedanta would refinance the debt, he said. “But we are also looking at whether we can pay from our side.”What’s the market saying?While equity investors gave the demerger plan a thumbs up, Vedanta’s dollar bonds have tumbled. Of the four notes, three are trading below the 80 cents-on-the-dollar mark typically considered distressed.The split off doesn’t immediately address Vedanta’s maturing overseas bonds. The group has yet to provide details on how exactly its debt will be spread under the new structure, or how shares currently being used as collateral will be treated. Vedanta Resources has pledged virtually all of its majority holdings in both Vedanta Ltd. and Hindustan Zinc Ltd., according to exchange data.“The consolidated debt across all its proposed entities will still remain the same,” according to CreditSights analysts led by Lakshmanan R. “We remain concerned that the precarious debt situation at Vedanta Resources is still unaddressed.”How did the company become such a big player?Agarwal, who was raised in the Indian state of Bihar, took over his father’s business making aluminum conductors in the 1970s, and then branched into trading scrap metal.He built Vedanta Ltd. through a series of ambitious acquisitions: In 2001, Agarwal bought a controlling stake in then government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. and he followed that up with the purchase of another state-run firm, Hindustan Zinc. He successfully bid for iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd. in 2007 and for Cairn India. Vedanta Resources also owns copper and zinc operations in Africa.The company was the first in India to list in London back in 2003, before Agarwal took it private 15 years later when his now known Vedanta Inc. bought out minority investors as part of efforts to streamline the group’s structure. Agarwal has renamed Volcan Investments Ltd. to Vedanta Inc.It is this acquisition spree that led the conglomerate’s debt to balloon. Vedanta Resources’ total debt stood at $6.4 billion at the end of June.Will the demerger go through?The plan, which hinges on multiple government and regulatory approvals, is “far from a done deal,” Standard Chartered’s Head of Asia Corporate Credit Research Bharat Shettigar wrote in a note.Vedanta Ltd. will follow the rules as prescribed by the corporate and tax laws while it allocates debt to demerged businesses, Ajay Agarwal, president for finance, said in an investor conference call last week. The firm will consult the lenders during the process, he said.What are the next milestones?An implementation timeline indicates that lenders will weigh in on the plan late this financial year, with a filing to the National Company Law Tribunal envisioned by the end of 2023. The NCLT order is due to be received in July, with the listing of the new subsidiaries in September.As for payments, Vedanta Resources’ 2026 bond has an interest due on Oct. 23, according to Bloomberg-compiled data."

Serum, India’s most valuable unlisted company, already supplies vaccines to 170 nations, including Covid shots sold in Europe and the US.While company officials toyed with the idea of going public during the pandemic, when it needed $2 billion to boost production to 4 billion doses a year, there are no plans to do so at the moment, Poonawalla said. The company financed its 2020 expansion for the production of Covid vaccines by taking advances, including from the Indian government and philanthropists like Bill Gates, he said.Going public “does hinder your decision making,” Poonawalla said. “I would probably have been chastised for charging $3 per shot as a CEO where there was clearly money on the table to charge higher prices.”The process did come with setbacks. Serum struggled to meet demand and its obligations as the pandemic raged and a factory fire slashed production. In April 2021, the Indian government banned Covid vaccine exports to prioritize the local population. The ban wasn’t lifted until November 2021.The company could change its approach to take on debt or add partners if a further expansion is required that it can’t finance internally, Poonawalla said.Containing CostsCurrently, Serum spends $150 million to $250 million a year on improving production and conducting research, out of its $850 million to $900 million in annual revenue, he said. It costs $50 million to $100 million over a handful of years to develop a new vaccine, with a price tag exceeding $200 million once clinical trials and manufacturing are included, he said.The fiscally conservative approach gives Serum the ability to chart its own course, helping it to roll out meningitis and human papillomavirus vaccines for poor countries. It’s also allowed Poonawalla’s family to amass a fortune. His father, Cyrus, is worth $19.2 billion, according to Bloomberg’s rich list.Cost is one reason the company doesn’t plan to expand production in Africa, where leaders are clamoring for vaccine factories to be built on the continent, he said. Aside from a facility in the Netherlands, all manufacturing is likely to remain in India where economies of scale help drive down expenses, he said.“If you start making a product in Africa, the prices are going to go up and we don’t want that to happen,” he said. “We want to keep the prices as low as possible to have the access as wide as possible.”The company is experimenting with allowing some of its vaccines to be made under a licensing deal, most notably with South Africa’s Aspen Pharamacare Holdings Ltd.Lessons ForgottenThe expansion in vaccine production necessitated by Covid has better positioned the world to tackle the next pandemic, at least as far as the private sector is concerned, Poonawalla said. Diagnostics and testing capacity is also on firmer footing, he said.“The private sector will always rise to the occasion, either because it’s a good business opportunity or it is something strategic they want to do,” he said.What he’s worried about is the slow pace of new product approvals and the reluctance of governments to work together.“We have not, sadly, made a lot of strides,” he said. “After the pandemic sort of went away, everyone got back to all their other issues and sort of lost focus on the future preparedness.”"

Chief executives like to think they aim high. “Go big or go home” and similar slogans gained currency late in the last century and still capture the imagination today.

Yet many US corporate chiefs have actually prioritised the opposite approach for much of that time: they put more emphasis on hitting near-term earnings targets at the expense of spending on long-term success.

That is almost certainly a mistake. Studies by McKinsey, the CFA Institute and others consistently show that companies...

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vivek-wadhwas-new-venture-aims-to-use-breath-to-detect-cancer-11472571.html,Vivek Wadhwa’s new venture aims to use breath to detect cancer,"October 04, 2023 06:56 AM IST",Wadhwa’s career as a public commentator won both him fame and notoriety. In a series of opinion columns in the Washington Post in the 2010s he had a habit of taking positions that rankled the Silicon Valley establishment.,"Over the last five years Vivek Wadhwa, an entrepreneur and academic who’s well known in Silicon Valley, has been working on a longshot project to detect cancer in people using only their breath — similar to using a breathalyzer.Wadhwa’s new company, which has not been previously reported, is called Vionix Biosciences Inc. Its goal of collecting health information in a less invasive way has long been a dream of technologists. See: Elizabeth Holmes’ failed blood-testing startup Theranos. But unlike Holmes, who overpromised in the company’s early days, Wadhwa is starting small. He’s brought on advisers from Harvard Medical School, the Mayo Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital to try to prove out the concept. So far, he’s spent about $500,000 of his own cash on the initiative and plans to spend $500,000 more, dipping into his retirement savings with the aim of having a working prototype later this year or in 2024.If the device works, such a tool could substantially improve certain types of cancer screening and allow for earlier detection in underserved communities, though plenty of obstacles remain.Wadhwa, 66, was born in India and immigrated to the US where he joined the technology industry. He founded two companies and wrote five books, along with a spate of prestigious teaching jobs including a stint as head of faculty at the now-embattled Singularity University, dedicated to solving the world’s problems through entrepreneurship.Wadhwa’s career as a public commentator won both him fame and notoriety. In a series of opinion columns in the Washington Post in the 2010s he had a habit of taking positions that rankled the Silicon Valley establishment. Among them: drawing attention to the lack of meritocracy in tech, long before racial and gender disparities became accepted fact. He also launched efforts to promote women in the industry — though critics said his advocacy could be condescending, and he eventually said he’d let women lead the charge on the issue.Wadhwa’s life as a Silicon Valley chronicler changed when his wife, Tavinder, started feeling unwell during a family holiday in Mexico in 2018, and was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. She soon entered chemotherapy, underwent genomic sequencing and tried various drugs, both established and experimental.After her diagnosis, Wadhwa started dedicating much of his time to learning about the disease. He called on friends and professional acquaintances, talking with Siddhartha Mukherjee, author of The Emperor of All Maladies, who educated him on the limits of genomic sequencing. He also had conversations with tech titans who have taken a personal interest in health. These people include Sean Parker, the Napster co-founder who’s now an active donor to cancer research with a particular focus on immunotherapy. Parker “spent many hours teaching me the basics,” he wrote in an email to friends in 2019.Wadhwa’s eventual conclusion: Doctors need a tool that allows them to conduct on-site tests that provide a higher level of detail compared with current tests. He wanted a device that is portable, costs $5,000 or less, consumes no more than 100 watts and can produce results in under five minutes — all in a box that is roughly the size of a desktop printer.There are reasons that vision will be difficult to realize. “Breath measurement is tricky,” said Alex Morgan, a venture capitalist at Khosla Ventures, who has not reviewed Wadhwa’s company. Morgan has invested in Invoy LLC, a startup that uses breath to measure ketones, chemicals emitted when the body is burning fat. Other companies working on breath diagnostics include the UK’s Owlstone Medical. And at the University of Colorado at Boulder, researchers recently published their results on a laser-based breathalyzer that detects Covid-19.By this July, Wadhwa was ready to start a company dedicated to cancer detection, and incorporated Vionix. He initially thought he would start with blood tests, but he changed his mind after consulting with diagnostics specialists including Vionix’s chief scientific officer, genome scientist Binay Panda. He learned that breath may include compounds related to lung cancer, breast cancer and others. “I never thought that there was so much information in breath,” he wrote in an update to a handful of supporters in September.Once Vionix can handle breath tests — itself a large and unproven undertaking — it plans to move on to blood tests, urine tests, and finally, saliva tests, all done on the same device and using a cold plasma-based process Wadhwa has licensed from a group in Chile. The process, which will use artificial intelligence to recognize key characteristics of disease, in theory will make it possible to detect more biomarkers than existing tools, more accurately.Because the Vionix device would be portable, Wadhwa aims to operate both inside and outside of clinics. A portable tool would be particularly useful in poor or rural populations said Keith Flaherty, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the director of clinical research at Massachusetts General Hospital’s cancer center. Flaherty, a Vionix advisor, said that “this approach feels like stepping into a time machine,” but cautioned that “it’s way too soon to tell” if the technology will work as hoped.Longtime Silicon Valley watchers will remember that Elizabeth Holmes made bold statements about her blood-testing company, Theranos, which ended with charges of fraud and the company’s collapse after investors had poured in $9 billion. Wadhwa says that in part because of Theranos’ legacy, his policy will be to get outside researchers to use Vionix and document their results, rather than validating the machine in-house. “No secrecy, no ethical lapses, no obsessions with making money,” he said. “Having said that, if I raise money, I am going to build a profitable company which could be worth billions.”Toward the end of his wife’s illness, Wadhwa said she asked him to prevent other people from suffering the same way. Despite an aggressive course of treatment, she died the summer after her diagnosis. She was 57. Earlier detection could have led to a different outcome, Wadhwa says.“Her words and thoughts gave me the motivation,” he said. “I will be hers forever.”"

His latest attempt to trim down the holding company's dues by getting its unit, Hindustan Zinc, to buy some of the firm's zinc assets also did not succeed due to opposition from the Indian government, which is a minority shareholder.""As it will take time to complete demerger, (the process) won't be helpful for the parent company to meet debt obligation. It has insufficient revenues, and hence the likely course of action is refinancing or a stake-sale in subsidiaries,"" Centrum Broking said in a note.Analysts also said some of the company's non-core businesses not generating enough cash were likely to be sold after the demerger.Vedanta shares, which have lost about one-fourth of its value this year, were up 4.5% to 232.80 rupees on Tuesday. The metals index is up about 1% so far this year."

The plan would see it repay about half of the January 2024 note’s principal and a smaller proportion on the March 2025 debt, the people said. It’s unclear whether the company is also planning to repay some of the August 2024 bond, which was issued via a different entity.The terms of the proposal could still change and the plan faces some investor opposition.“Vedanta is in continuous discussions with its bond holders in the ordinary course including to address upcoming maturities and has been very constructive and productive,” a spokesperson said. “The company is confident that it will have the support of bondholders in all three series of notes for executing an agreed upon exercise.”With roughly $3 billion of US-currency bonds coming due over the next two years, the miner is on a quest for cash. In a move that’s expected to buttress its finances, subsidiary Vedanta Ltd. is preparing to spin off businesses into several listed entities, Bloomberg reported this week.Citing the elevated risk of debt restructuring over the next few months, Moody’s Investors Service this week cut Vedanta Resources’ corporate family rating deeper into junk.Although the January 2024 bond was indicated at 90 cents on the dollar, the other two have slipped below the mark indicative of distress.The August 2024 note was quoted down 0.5 cents at 63. cents at 8:24m in Hong Hong on Thursday, while that due in March 2025 was down 0.2 cents at 73.5cents, data compiled by Bloomberg showed."

Unfortunately, the results are not yet apparent,"" Bhargava said.He noted that the bulk of the interaction of manufacturers and entrepreneurs is with the state government officials.""And in the state governments, the bureaucracy and the entire administration has still not changed the way the central government has changed,"" Bhargava said.He further said: ""And there are lots of delays. Time is not a factor which is valued highly by most people in the states. And the attitude of administration is very much similar to what it used to be in the licence and control days, that the job of the bureaucracy the job of the civil servant is to control rather than facilitate.Besides, the entrepreneurs are also largely maintaining the mindset and practices which were developed during the licences and control period because in those days the private sector was not in a position to grow in any way or innovate because the licence laid down every condition of their functioning, Bhargava said.""Now, that resulted in various malpractices developing.. you're all aware of the growth of black money in the country. We are all aware of what black money growth means in terms of ostentatious consumption,"" he added.He further said: ""So as long as the system continues where entrepreneurs, businessmen are more concerned about showing off their personal wealth and generating personal incomes and are not so much focused on growing their companies. I'm afraid the growth rates will not work..Citing the example of Maruti Suzuki, Bhargava said the company grew at a time when all the conditions were unfavourable.He noted that despite improvement in the ease of doing business in the country, the growth of the manufacturing sector is still about 5 per cent a year.""We need to get up to 12 per cent a year. That's the kind of change which is needed and it cannot happen unless everybody involved in this business, whether it's people who are vendors, people who are dealers, people who are entrepreneurs, people who are large industrialists, they all decide that our first priority is to grow our companies not our personal wealth,"" Bhargava said.He noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pointed out in 2014 that if the country wanted to solve major issues like poverty and unemployment in the country the manufacturing sector has to grow at a higher rate.""If we are going to have greater equity in our society, all of this would only be possible if the manufacturing sector grows faster, and we reach at least 25 per cent of the GDP through the manufacturing sector,"" Bhargava said.On the domestic car industry, he noted that India is now the biggest growing market in the world.There is no other country in the world of any size, which has the potential for growth in the car market, which India has, he noted.Whether it is the US, Europe, Japan or China, all these countries have now become saturated, Bhargava said.""India is the only country which still has a lot of distance to go before the market becomes saturated. And it is for this reason that in the last 15-20 years, almost every car manufacturer in the world has found his way into India, and those who haven't come are still looking to come now,"" he stated.So the Indian car market is going to be a growing car market and equally it is going to be a highly competitive car market, he noted.Companies have to work to bring the best of technologies, the best products, the greatest reliability in the products, and the best of after-sales service, Bhargava said.""That's what Maruti has been trying to do all these 40 years. That is what we will continue to do. And we will continue to see that we make our best efforts to keep a large part of the market under our control,"" he added.On the company's plans to introduce electric cars, Bhargava said the company plans to bring in six models over the next few years in order to keep its market share intact.""If we are to keep 45-50 per cent of that market. You can't do it by having one or two models. You need to have a large number of models..six models we feel is the minimum that we require.He further said: ""Even with six models, we think that by 2030 only about 15-20 per cent of our sales will be electric vehicles.Maruti Suzuki plans to launch its first battery-electric vehicle by 2025.Bhargava said the company was first trying to convert WagonR into an electric car..The conversion happened but the company realised that the cost of the car was coming out to be so high that it would not be a viable proposition, he added.""And that is why we gave it up and said that now let's look at developing a bigger model because the lower car segment is not such as could be converted to electric operations and still remain within the affordability region for customers of that car,"" Bhargava said.By the time the company enters the electric segment there would be the possibility of reasonable volume being sold in the market, he said."

Over this timeline, the airline set itself on a five-year transformative plan called ‘Vihaan.AI’ and made the second largest order in the history of commercial aviation of 470 aircraft.It also recently received a nod from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for the Air India-Vistara merger. Similarly, earlier this year Air India received the competition watchdog’s nod to merge the low cost airlines Air Asia India with Air India Express. While the first phase of its transformative journey ‘taxi’ is done and dusted, the airline is now in its second phase, the ‘take-off’.""The first six months were spent focusing on addressing accumulated issues of the past and the team has done a good job, so far. We are in the midst of deploying systems and getting the necessary people and talent for growth. It's a long way to go, but it's a good start,” Air India CEO Campbell Wilson told CNBC TV18's Managing Editor Shereen Bhan in an exclusive interview.Air India is halfway through the second phase of its transformative journey ‘take-off’. On the commercial side, revenue management, distribution, website, back office and IT, new systems are being deployed. The new rostering, fatigue management, human resource, financial and engineering systems are being deployed in a phased manner. The VRS phase in the airline is over and many employees have also been adjusted in the business with new skills. Wilson said, “In aviation terms we are still on the runway but we are getting close to V1.”Air India is also re-negotiating contracts with vendors with a special focus on spare part suppliers. Offices of all four airlines — Air India, Vistara, Air Asia India and Air India Express — have been shifted to the Vatika One On One Complex in Gurugram. “While CCI has given approval for Air India-Vistara merger, we’re awaiting more regulatory approvals in other countries. Similarly, the merger of LCCs is also following its regulatory process,” Wilson said.A few months ago, Air India made global headlines by placing an order of 470 aircraft with Boeing and Airbus and those deliveries are expected to begin soon. “We are in the process of getting India’s first A350 very soon. We are also in the process of taking ownership of our first Boeing 737. In the next few months we will receive 25 Airbus A320, five Boeing 777 and six Airbus A350,” he said.At present, six wide body aircraft are in service from Delhi to London, San Francisco to Bengaluru, Mumbai to New York and the new aircraft will be added to these routes to increase their frequency. In the last 12 months, Air India’s capacity has gone up by 26 percent and many new routes and destinations are set to be added in the network. ""People are going to see an acceleration in our efforts. Clearly there's a lot more we need to do, don't consider ourselves anywhere close to the finished product yet, but there is progress happening,"" Wilson said.While some airlines are facing issues due to shortage of pilots, things are very different at Air India, which has recruited more than 650 pilots till now. “A lot of people want to work for Air India. We are offering one of the fastest paths in the industry to employees. From induction to command, from narrow body to wide body if you're an aviation professional, where else would you want to work?,"" Wilson said.Air India has also invested $200 million in its training academy. Wilson added that the airline is adding people as it is adding aircraft, and the recruitment is underway much ahead of the aircraft induction. ""Currently, we are incurring a cost as employees are in the training process. The company as a whole is building a capacity bigger than the current fleet. We want our employees to be productive and want to give our pilots ample flying hours for their own career progression.”Air India's existing wide body fleet is all set to get a refreshed look as the airline has marked some money to refurbish the aircraft, following which they will get a new inflight entertainment system, galley and lavatory. As much as $400 million will be spent on new seats. The first aircraft is expected to be rolled out by July or August 2024.When asked about what are the targets for capturing the market share, Wilson said, ""Air India is generating higher revenues and cash flows. The market share is not the objective, running a good business is. We want to achieve a 30 percent domestic market share and achieve 30 percent international market share. We're on track to achieve market share goals. Focusing on delivering a good product and good revenues.""In a surprising revelation the Air India CEO said that most of the inflight entertainment systems are quite old. ""The current in-flight system dates from around the time as the first iPhone. Trying to procure spares from the secondary market for the retrofit process. The inflight systems in the existing business class is 99.5 percent reliable. By the middle of next year we should be able to get 100 percent retrofitting done,"" he said.On being asked about what the status of the AI-Vistara merger is and what will happen to the brand Vistara, Wilson said he is awaiting the clearances of competition authorities from other parts of the world. ""We are trying to align operating processes and systems across the four airlines. Vistara has a very good business model because it's a newer airline. Certain Vistara elements don't complement Air India. Eighteen months worth of work is left for the Air India-Vistara merger. Vistara will continue to operate as Vistara, there is no timeline to completely merge both airlines. There is no rush to do it, we want to learn what we can from each other,"" he said.On the type of reception of the new brand identity Campbell said a new brand identity carries forward traditional patterns of Air India. "" Public opinion on new brand identity is subjective, and received really positive feedback from people. We are happy with the new brand launch and feedback we've received, and hopeful that people will support the new Air India brand,"" he said.Air India has ambitions of catering to a wide range of passengers from India and outside. ""Not just Indians, but people of the world wanting to travel on a high class, high quality, reliable, well regarded, affordable airline. Air India's aspiration is to be a world class global carrier with an Indian heart,"" he said."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/china-scoops-up-cheap-indian-iron-ore-in-bid-to-trim-steel-costs-11431001.html,China scoops up cheap Indian iron ore in bid to trim steel costs,"September 26, 2023 02:04 PM IST","India will continue to sell about 3 million tons a month to global markets for rest of the year, CRU Group said.","Indian iron ore exports have surged this year as steel mills, mainly in the biggest buyer China, switched to lower-grade, cheaper feed in the face of dwindling profits.Combined outbound shipments of iron ore and pellets from the South Asian nation more than doubled in the first eight months of 2023 to almost 28 million tons from a year earlier, according to researcher and rating agency ICRA Ltd., far surpassing the total exports of 2021 and 2022. India will continue to sell about 3 million tons a month to global markets for rest of the year, CRU Group said.“Chinese mills prefer cheaper Indian iron ore to reduce their input costs when steel margins are low,” said Lalit Ladkat, an analyst at CRU. Indian ore is currently being offered at around $70 a ton, free-on-board, he said.The steelmaking ingredient is currently trading near $115 a ton on the Singapore exchange, the global benchmark.The increased inflows from India will help shave some costs for Chinese mills that are maintaining production despite the country’s economic slowdown. The steel industry has been hit hard, with profits at ferrous metals producers dropping 91% over the first seven months of the year. Iron ore prices have risen 20% in the past year.These purchases are “opportunistic buying” by Chinese mills which generally lean toward purchases of lower-grade ore during periods of subdued mill margins, according to ICRA’s Vice President for Corporate Ratings Priyesh Ruparelia. Greater availability of railway rakes to move the ore to ports also aided shipments, he said.Exports are also being bolstered by the Indian government removing a hefty export tax it had imposed last year to curb a rise in local steel prices. Foreign sales bounced back rapidly thereafter, with tonnages in 2023 already exceeding last year’s volumes by over 40%, according to ICRA.On the production side, this year’s lackluster monsoon season, which is typically a lean period for iron ore extraction in India, led to increased output, resulting in a surplus in the local market and boosting exports, according to Ladkat. India’s iron ore production is forecast to grow as much as 10% this financial year ending March to 275 million tons, outpacing a rise in local demand, he said."

""There is a lot of uncertainty still coming from the exchange rate...interest rates are further going up. So you know we still have three and a half months to go for the year to get over... so outlook wise we can still be confident it should be around the double digit mark,"" he stated.Iyer noted that more and more customers are now opting for costlier trims across its product range, which was not the case earlier. He said that Mercedes-Benz globally believes that it is more important to provide the right experience and right kind of equipment to a customer than just focus on attaining sales numbers.""We feel what's more important is to do the right things, get the right products, equipment, get the right customer experience, because that should then drive volumes.It will be an outcome of what we are trying to do,"" he noted.On the overall domestic luxury car market, which roughly accounts for just 1 per cent of the overall passenger vehicle industry currently, he noted that the segment could end somewhere in the region of 45,000 cars this year making it the best so far. ""This year we can see the market growing with everybody participating and that's a great sign for the overall health of the luxury car market,"" Iyer stated.He noted that demand is increasing with new set of buyers, including women and salaried employees, also opting for luxury cars. ""There is an increasing trend to reward yourself with luxury products... the volumes will come, it's just a matter of time,"" Iyer said.He noted that in the top 7-8 cities in India the penetration for luxury cars has already crossed 2 per cent and it's a matter of time that the rest of the country also catches up. When asked about battery electric vehicles, Iyer said the three electric models it sells currently in the market account for around 4-5 per cent of its total sales.""It's a matter of time that this market matures and we see more adoption,"" he stated. Mercedes expects 25 per cent of its sales in India to come from electric vehicles in the next five years.When asked if the company could bring in more electric cars, Iyer said: ""Of course there is a roadmap. We feel we have to be patient here, because a lot of questions are still unanswered from the consumer perspective, and it is a job of us as OEMs to educate consumers.""So it takes some time and three to four years is a reasonable period to do that, he added.""To go to 25 per cent (share of EV sales) if you're rushing for volumes, even now we can get more products...but I think we want to read the market,"" Iyer said.He noted that growth of charging infrastructure and educating the customer about the technology would help in the growth of the overall adoption of the electric cars in the country.The company has recently announced the extension of its electric vehicle charging network to the customers of other brands as it looks to accelerate faster adoption of electric vehicles in the country. ""We feel that the more the EV ecosystem grows, the more will be the growth of brands ,"" Iyer noted."

Leave no one behind is the theme of this year's World Lung Day.,"On World Lung Day, a nationwide initiative aimed at raising awareness about the importance of lung health and the need for early diagnosis and treatment of respiratory ailments has been launched by a pharma company.'Access to prevention and treatment for all. Leave no one behind is the theme of this year's World Lung Day.Pharmaceutical company Alkem, in a statement, said that it is committed to reaching every corner of India through this initiative, responding to the increasing number of people suffering from respiratory diseases.As part of their mission, Alkem is organising 700 to 800 camps across India, collaborating with nearly 100 hospitals in tier-1 and tier-2 cities.Sudipta Roy, President, Head-Acute business of Alkem Laboratories Limited, said, ""India faces a significant burden of chronic respiratory diseases (CRD), contributing to 15.69 per cent of the global CRD cases.What's even more concerning is that India accounts for a disproportionate 30.28 per cent of all global deaths attributed to CRD."" One particular CRD, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), is especially prevalent in India with a staggering 55.23 million cases, the highest in the world.Tragically, India also ranks second globally in terms of COPD-related deaths, with nearly 0.85 million fatalities each year, Roy said.Furthermore, the nation grapples with a distressing reality regarding asthma. With India accounting for 43 per cent of global fatalities related to asthma, the country leads the world in terms of deaths caused by this condition, he said.""This World Lung Day, Alkem Laboratories Limited is dedicated to promoting healthy lungs and the importance of inhalation therapy. We believe that access to quality healthcare, including inhalation therapy, should be a fundamental right for every individual. Through our countrywide initiative, we aim to spread awareness, educate the public, and ensure that no one is left behind in the fight against respiratory diseases,"" Roy added.He said that inhalation therapy plays a pivotal role in mainstream respiratory management and is often the first line of treatment for lung diseases, including asthma and COPD."

It is reiterated that the parties are free to fix their notice period as per their mutual understanding and DGCA has no role to play in the same,"" it said.The airline, which operated its first commercial flight between Mumbai and Ahmedabad on August 7, 2022, has hit turbulence following the resignation of several pilots.SNV Aviation Private Limited, which flies under the brand name Akasa Air, has sought a direction to the DGCA to take coercive action against pilots who failed to comply with the mandatory notice period requirements, in terms of the CAR 2017.The airline, in its plea, said it has not been able to secure any efficacious remedy to protect itself and the public from ""reckless and irresponsible"" actions of certain pilots and added it was deeply aggrieved by the ""callous"" conduct of the pilots whose actions are blatantly in the teeth of the 2017 CAR and the contractual arrangements with the company.It said with every such ""illegal"" resignation, that is conveniently carried out by the pilots without consequence, other pilots are encouraged to follow the same course of action which is clear from the ever-increasing number of pilots who have resigned since the first resignation in June 2023.The plea said the airline officials met DGCA representatives several times to explain their difficulties but failed to receive any response or assurance from the authorities after which it gave a representation to the Minister of Civil Aviation but no action appears to have been taken.As a result of the pilots' actions, immense difficulty and inconvenience has been caused to the public in as much as there have been numerous cases of last-minute flight cancellations, delays and grounding of flights, it said.The airline added that such a precarious situation has fallen upon the petitioners despite their scrupulous compliance with all applicable regulations and the terms of its agreements with the pilots.(With PTI inputs)"

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/delta-corp-game-over-or-will-the-house-win-as-always-11419801.html,Delta Corp: Game over or will the house win as always?,"September 25, 2023 02:48 PM IST","The September 22, claim by the tax department is 3.5x Delta Corp’s last closing market cap and more than double the company’s last decade’s revenue. One saving grace is that the company is debt free.","Enough jokes have been made this year about stock markets turning out to be gambling dens. For one, traders have been a losing lot with more than 90 percent making losses in trade according to a Sebi study. But how should investors take to Delta Corp, which stands at the intersection of the two, and has been hit by an avalanche of bad news?On September 22, the casino operator was slapped with a tax notice amounting to Rs 16,822 crore. In reaction, the stock slumped to a 52-week low of Rs 140.35 on September 25 on the NSE, over 19 percent down from the previous close.A month ago its chief financial officer resigned. Two months ago the company informed that the initial public offering of its online gaming business had been put on hold. This followed the government announcement to levy a 28 percent GST on gross bet value for casinos three months ago.How bad is the bad news, really? The September 22 claim by the tax department is 3.5x Delta Corp’s last closing market cap and more than double the company’s last decade’s revenue. One saving grace is that the company is debt free.“Leave aside the short-term impact, a Rs 16,822-crore tax notice is a big negative even in the medium-term,” said Kranthi Bathini of WealthMills Securities, who has been tracking the company for over 15 years.Furthermore, this comes at a time when Delta Corp has inherent capacity constraints for a long time given high entry barriers and strict regulations on gambling. “Its Daman casino proposal has been pending for many years,” Bathini adds.That’s not surprising because regulations governing casino licensing in India are challenging for several reasons. Sonam Chandwani of KS Legal adds, “Firstly, gambling laws in India are primarily a state matter, leading to varying regulations and requirements across different states. Secondly, there's a historical and cultural sensitivity towards gambling, which has led to cautious and restrictive policies.”Considering the enormity of the tax claim, a sharp correction in the stock was inevitable. The day after Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were demonetised in November 2016, the stock had corrected 20 percent. The share price slowly managed to scale past the Rs 370 mark in January 2018 but has been on a downward journey ever since. Another 20 percent blow came after the 28 percent GST announcement in July 2023.Also read: After second intimation, Delta Corp's GST liability totals to nearly Rs 17,000 croreAccording to Abhishek Jain of Arihant Capital Markets, the next six to nine months will be a consolidation phase for the industry and the stock. “Given the tax burden, many small companies are now shutting shop,” he said.Can the company fight this tax notice?The consensus view is it can. The amount claimed is based on the gross bet value of all games played at the casinos from July 2017 to March 2022, while the new GST rule came into effect only from October 2023.Furthermore, the demand for GST on the gross value of chips, rather than gross gaming revenue, has been an industry issue and various representations have already been made to the government.“The company has been legally advised that the tax demand is arbitrary and contrary to law, and the company will pursue all legal remedies available to it to challenge such tax demand and related proceedings,” Delta Corp said in its exchange filing.What makes the case stronger for Delta Corp is the backing of Zia Mody, said an analyst who did not want to be named. Zia Mody is married to Delta Corp’s promoter Jaydev Mody and is the co-founder of AZB & Partners, one of India’s leading law firms. “She is among Asia’s largest corporate attorneys,” the analyst said.Investors’ odds of winningOver the past five years, the company's sales have compounded at 11 percent, and its net profit at 13 percent. While the new GST rule is a speedbump, the long-term story is intact, believe analysts.“The long-term view for Delta Corp appears promising given its dominance in the Indian casino industry, strong brand, and loyal customer base. Investors who believe in the company's ability to navigate the challenges, the current stock price dip might present a buying opportunity,” said Sonam Srivastava, founder at Wright Research and fund manager of a quant-based PMS.Savvy investor Mukul Agrawal holds a little over 1 percent stake in the company and has not tinkered with his stake since September 2022. A look at the overall shareholding pattern shows institutional investors are also betting on Delta Corp. For the quarter ended June 2023, FII holding in the company went up to 6.68 percent from 5.35 percent in the quarter-ago period. DII holding went up to 18.04 percent from 14.50 percent during the same period.In fact, Quant Mutual Fund has been loading up on Delta Corp for the past three months. It now forms 1.32 percent of its Small Cap Growth Fund’s AUM. Another active fund - HDFC Midcap Opportunities – which has 4.15 percent shareholding in the company has stayed put and not trimmed its holding despite all the bad news.A major reason behind this is ‘gamblers will gamble just like smokers will smoke despite bump up in costs’. That apart, many tourists wish to try their hand once to see how it goes.“Despite the Daman hindrance, Delta continues to expand in Goa,” said Jain. A new vessel, set to be operational in FY24, will replace the Deltin Caravela and will increase the company’s current capacity by 2.5x.And whenever the Daman license comes through, it carries huge option value. “It's an internationally accepted fact that a casino with a 10 million population within a four-hour driving distance is a goldmine. Daman has 50 million,"" the management had said in an earnings con-call.Since the tax notice announcement came after market hours on Friday, the stock was a big loser in trade today. It was undoubtedly a stomach-churning day for investors in the stock.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

India is a focus area, he said.","Videogame studio Capcom Co. may sell more copies of games in India than in China within a decade as the publisher behind the Resident Evil franchise looks to new markets for long-term growth, according to Chief Operating Officer Haruhiro Tsujimoto.Key to the Osaka-based company’s strategy are securing local tie-ups to lift the profile and sales of its PC games in emerging markets and expanding its offerings of console-quality titles to smartphones, the 58-year-old executive said in an interview. India is a focus area, he said.“The market in India will grow exponentially in 5 to 10 years, as college students who enjoy games grow older and the economy develops,” Tsujimoto said. “India’s population has already surpassed China’s. Taking that into consideration, we can expect to do better there than in China.”The studio, which houses hit franchises such as Street Fighter and Monster Hunter, is seeking partnerships to market its titles in India and Southeast Asia. Local device makers and influencers may help Capcom expand further in high-margin digital downloads, which now earn 90% of total unit-based videogame sales at the company, Tsujimoto said.Capcom’s presence in India is still tiny, at little more than 100,000 video game copies a year, in part due to its low profile in mobile games and limited sales efforts. Smartphones are the main device by which many young Indians access the Internet, making a wide-ranging portfolio of mobile games essential for Capcom to expand in the country.The Japanese company targets annual sales in India of as many as two million copies within the next decade to match or even surpass its operations in China, the executive said. India’s overall video games market is seen reaching $1.6 billion in 2027, almost double expected sales in 2023, according to Asia-focused gaming research firm Niko Partners.The company’s weak presence in free-to-play games is widely seen as a handicap, as mobile games comprise about half of the global video game market according to Newzoo data. But instead of creating such games on its own, Capcom plans to license content to others. This year, it enlisted Pokémon Go creator Niantic Inc. to develop the mobile game Monster Hunter Now, released earlier this month.Traditional free-to-play smartphone games are “not a good fit with Capcom’s brand,” Tsujimoto said. Instead, the studio will focus on releasing console titles for download on smart devices, he said. Capcom said earlier this month it will release Resident Evil games playable for Apple Inc.’s iPhones and iPads.“High-quality games should become more playable on a wider range of smartphones in the next few years, and that will give us an opportunity to reach gamers who don’t have consoles and PCs,” Tsujimoto said.Capcom targets selling more than 100 million copies of games a year, with the majority to come from games released in past fiscal years. And while games makers traditionally waited for console makers and other platform operators to forge new markets, Tsujimoto said it’s up to Capcom to create its own demand.“Finding and cultivating new markets is our own responsibility, and we will keep doing so aggressively,” he said."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/nvidia-ceo-touts-india-as-major-ai-market-in-bid-to-hedge-china-risks-11403091.html,Nvidia CEO touts India as major AI market in bid to hedge China risks,"September 21, 2023 01:32 PM IST","As the US increasingly clamps down on exports of high-end chips to China and the world seeks an alternative electronics manufacturing base, India could shape up to be a source of AI talent, site for chip production and market for Nvidia’s products.","During a five-day tour of India earlier this month, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang visited four cities, dined with tech executives and researchers, took numerous selfies, and sat for a one-on-one conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the AI sector. Huang’s India itinerary was so crammed that he confessed to surviving entire work days on spicy masala omelets and cold coffees.Huang may have been treated like a head of state, but the trip’s purpose was all business. For Nvidia, whose graphics processors are vital to the development of artificial intelligence systems, the South Asian nation of 1.4 billion people presents a rare opportunity. As the US increasingly clamps down on exports of high-end chips to China and the world seeks an alternative electronics manufacturing base, India could shape up to be a source of AI talent, site for chip production and market for Nvidia’s products.At a meeting with leading researchers in Delhi, Huang spoke of re-training entire swaths of the country’s workforce and building future AI models using Indian data and talent, according to multiple attendees. Huang also told one executive in India’s tech hub Bangalore that he’s a big believer in the country’s engineering talent, particularly graduates from its top engineering schools, Indian Institutes of Technology.“You have the data, you have the talent,” Huang said at a news conference in Bangalore. Huang added:  “This is going to be one of the largest AI markets in the world.”Nvidia and India have a shared interest in betting on, and speeding up, the country’s AI ascendancy. Chipmakers cannot sell top-end microprocessors to China, which accounts for a fifth of Nvidia’s sales, amid fears the chips could be used to develop autonomous weaponry or wage cyberwarfare. “India is the only market remaining so it isn’t surprising that Nvidia wants to put multiple eggs in that basket,” said Neil Shah, vice president of research at Counterpoint Technology Market Research.While Indian engineers are a vital part of the digital workforce, the country is still far away from developing the cutting-edge capabilities needed to manufacture Nvidia’s sophisticated chips. But India has ambitions to boost electronics manufacturing as well as harness AI to buoy its digital economy. The country is plowing billions in subsidies to set up chip manufacturing infrastructure to lure the likes of Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Intel Corp.“India is strategic to Nvidia’s future,” said Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Ltd. and a designer of vital portions of the country’s massive digital public infrastructure. “The government is aggressively building AI infrastructure and so are large private companies. That’s good news for Huang,” said Nilekani, who dined with the chip billionaire during the visit.Had an excellent meeting with Mr. Jensen Huang, the CEO of @nvidia. We talked at length about the rich potential India offers in the world of AI. Mr. Jensen Huang was appreciative of the strides India has made in this sector and was equally upbeat about the talented youth of… pic.twitter.com/zT6Cyrmk5z— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) September 4, 2023In Delhi, the Taiwanese-American billionaire showed up at the prime minister’s residence in his trademark black leather jacket, braving sweltering 90-plus-degree summer temperatures. Modi later shared that the two talked about “the rich potential India offers in the world of AI.”Huang and Nvidia saw signs of that potential during the trip.  India’s largest conglomerate, Reliance, owned by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, announced during Huang’s multi-city tour that its Jio Platforms would build AI computing infrastructure for the country. The AI cloud will use end-to-end Nvidia supercomputing technologies, the company said in a release. Reliance and another large conglomerate, Tata, will also build and operate state-of-the-art AI supercomputing data centers and offer AI infrastructure as a service for use by researchers, corporations and startups, Nvidia said, without giving details or sharing timelines.India has had reasonable success in enticing giants Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to shift contract electronics manufacturing from China — to a point where, this month, Apple will sell India-made iPhone 15 devices on launch day. Now it’s turning to semiconductors, armed with some experience in chip design and no history whatsoever in semiconductor foundries. Nearly all cutting-edge chips, including those designed by Nvidia, are made in Taiwan. Over several decades, the country spent billions to reach current levels of manufacturing sophistication.India wants to catch up, but it faces challenges turning itself into an AI hub. The country currently has no exascale compute capacity — being able to handle a billion billion calculations per second — nor the ready AI talent capable of writing sophisticated software, said Sashikumaar Ganesan, who chairs the computational and data sciences department at Indian Institute of Science. “We have to build not just AI infrastructure but also high-performance computing workforce,” said Ganesan, who was among those invited to Huang’s meeting with AI researchers.Still, India is a fast-maturing market for high-end technologies, said K. Krishna Moorthy, CEO of trade group India Electronics and Semiconductor Association. That’s created huge demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, or graphics processing units. “As India’s digital economy grows, the government is mandating data security, data privacy and data localization, and this could require over 100,000 GPUs to build AI cloud infrastructure,” Moorthy said.The country has telecom giants like Reliance’s Jio which collect billions of data points daily from its half a billion mobile users and hundreds of millions of retailers. “The data generated from 1.4 billion Indians could set the country up for the next phase of digital growth,” said Moorthy. “Huang understands this is where the next phase of growth for AI-enabling chips will happen.”Nvidia already has four engineering centers in India, including in Bangalore and in the Gurgaon suburbs of Delhi, with a total of 4,000 engineers, its second-biggest talent pool after the US. During his trip, Huang held town halls at each of the locations and stressed the importance of remaining competitive in a rapidly evolving AI marketplace. While speaking to employees, he repeated a line he’s used in public before, offering his twist on the hunt-or-be-hunted adage: Either you are running for food or running away from being food."

It forecasts that the gap between bond yields and swaps will widen to 70 basis points by mid-November from the current 38 basis points.The trade will be favorable both in case of index inclusion or non-inclusion because the offshore swap market has a wider set of investors compared to onshore, which means market moves overseas will be larger, according to Sribalasundaram. In case of non-inclusion, bonds would underperform due to their recent outperformance, he wrote.Nomura’s trade recommendation comes amid growing buzz that India may finally be included in JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s emerging market bond index after Russia’s exclusion and growing geopolitical tensions around China. FTSE Russell is also scheduled to review its bond indexes on Sept. 28.“While our base case remains that India is unlikely to be included just yet, our conviction on this scenario is low,” Sribalasundaram wrote. “The operational hurdles around trading India bonds remain, but do not make it impossible.”The India bond-swap spread has narrowed significantly over the past few months and is currently trading well below the five-year average, according to Nomura.Net supply of government bonds will drop in the second half of the fiscal year, but the weekly supply remains large around 350 billion rupees ($4.2 billion), it said. “This supply warrants a wider bond-swap spread and a steeper India government bond curve,” Sribalasundaram wrote."

The momentum can sustain into next year and beyond as owners of Indian companies are keen to raise funds for other investments, said Abhinav Bharti, India head of equity capital markets at JPMorgan. Demand from local asset managers as well as foreign investors is also driving share sales, he added.“In block trades, every year now you can average $10 billion from 2024 onwards,” Bharti said in an interview in Mumbai. “I can see the building blocks of India becoming a market that can every year raise more than $30 billion from primary and secondary sales for corporates.”JPMorgan is the top manager of equity and rights offerings in India in the first eight months of 2023, according to data compiled by Bloomberg League Tables. The American bank has a market share of nearly 15%, followed by Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., which has an 11% share of the market.In contrast to block trades, India’s IPO activity has slowed down significantly this year, tracking a global slump in dealmaking. Companies have raised about $3.2 billion through first-time share sales so far in 2023, down from $5.5 billion for the same period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. There haven’t been any $1 billion IPOs since Life Insurance Corp. of India’s $2.7 billion listing in May 2022.A couple of $1 billion-plus IPOs could return to India after the country’s federal elections between April and May, Bharti said. The banker expects bigger IPOs to come from sectors such as consumer, technology and financial services.Strong corporate earnings and robust economic growth are drawing investors even as they flee other Asian emerging markets. China’s currency has plunged amid concerns over the once fast-growing nation’s precarious economic outlook and geopolitical tensions.“Because of recent softness in Chinese economic data, a lot of these global EM fund managers are underweight on China and now where you go and deploy that extra capital, you must have a counter overweight as well,” Bharti said. “India is benefiting from that.”"

Overall, less than a quarter of adult women in India work, among the lowest rates in the world.","HSBC pays for bankers’ nannies in India for up to six years. Morgan Stanley allows pregnant staff to expense cab rides, and Citigroup Inc. lets new moms work from home for a year after their maternity leave runs out.Across India, global financial firms are expanding maternity benefits to include perks rarely seen elsewhere, part of an effort to attract and retain female employees. Overall, less than a quarter of adult women in India work, among the lowest rates in the world.“We will never become a developed country without women’s participation,” said Aditya Mittal, chief human resources officer of Citi India & South Asia. The bank last week announced that new moms will now have the option to work from home for up to a year after their paid leave ends.India already mandates a minimum 26 weeks of maternity leave at full pay — among the most in the Group of 20 economies, according to the World Bank’s Gender Data Portal — and employers with more than 50 employees must offer a creche, or daycare, onsite or close by. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government also launched a job training program for women in 2021, and last year touted that adopting flexible hours could be a way to encourage women to work outside the home.It offers a stark contrast with the US, where there’s no legal provision for paid leave at all. There JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. both offer 16 weeks off for all new parents. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gives moms and dads 20 weeks off.Banks are hungry for talent in India. With US-China tensions growing, many global lenders are targeting the country, drawn by its fast-growing economy and burgeoning middle class. Dealmaking has surged. HSBC is recruiting wealth bankers for its reestablished private banking unit, and Citigroup has identified India as one of its top markets for expansion.Including talented women in the recruitment drive, and retaining those already working at the banks, means addressing the specific needs of female employees in the world’s most-populous country. In addition to the required on-site daycare, HSBC Holdings Plc provides female employees with a monthly childcare allowance of up to $216 to pay for a nanny to look after kids up to age of 6.The bank found that many of its employees wanted to keep their children home, and a nanny adds to the traditional extended-family support systems that new parents typically rely on, said Archana Chadha, head of human resources at HSBC India. The London-based bank, with about 39,000 employees in India, also provides new mothers with flexible hours and post-natal career development.“The idea is to provide support and make life easier for women when they come back to work,” she said in an interview in Mumbai.At Morgan Stanley, pregnant employees in Mumbai and Bangalore can expense cab rides to and from work in their last trimester, avoiding India’s notoriously overcrowded buses and trains. “We found a lot of women used to leave in that phase simply because it is so difficult to travel in public transport in those months,” said Rajat Mathur, head of human resources for India.Morgan Stanley also provides a gradual return to work for women coming back from maternity leave, coaching for expectant and new parents, and mentoring.

The plant is set to be inaugurated by a government official toward the end of this month.Beijing-based Xiaomi has been compelled to partner with Dixon for smartphone assembly because India is pressing Chinese companies to localize everything from manufacturing to distribution of devices. That means Xiaomi’s older suppliers in India — Taiwanese Foxconn Technology Group’s Bharat FIH and China’s DBG Technology Co. — are set to lose business.Xiaomi and Dixon representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.In a similar move earlier this year, Xiaomi handed a contract to India’s Optiemus Electronics Ltd. to make its Bluetooth neckband earphones, a product it previously imported from China.Xiaomi was once an unrivaled leader in India’s smartphone market, but lost steam after facing heightened regulatory scrutiny and overexpanding its product portfolio — which by its own admission confused customers.India, the world’s second-biggest smartphone market, is a hotly contested region for the world’s largest phone brands, with manufacturers such as Apple Inc. competing to boost sales in the world’s most populous country. Xiaomi is betting on a gradual recovery, as it looks to offer affordable locally made 5G smartphones.The Xiaomi partnership is another boost for the homegrown Dixon, which is among the companies vying to become India’s response to Foxconn — Apple’s Taiwanese supplier most famous as the key maker of iPhones. Founder Sunil Vachani, a suave dresser who often sports smart jackets or formal suits, started Dixon with borrowed money in a rented shed outside of New Delhi three decades ago. Today, Dixon is a rapidly expanding electronics company that makes products including smartphones, washing machines and television sets for brands such as Motorola and Samsung."

The French group could invest about $700 million in total into the projects, one of the people said.Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty for a transaction, the people said. Representatives for Adani and Total declined to comment.The deal would increase Total’s presence in the fast-growing Indian energy market, while giving Adani Green more means to develop new renewable energy projects. It would also see Total deepen its ties with Adani Green, which it’s already the second largest shareholder of with a 19.75% stake, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Total has frequently partnered with Adani as the French giant looks to boost its clean-energy output, in an effort to mollify shareholders demanding greater efforts to fight climate change. That aspiration dovetails with India’s ambitions to become a net-zero carbon nation by 2070 and curb its reliance on oil and coal.In 2019, Total spent $600 million to buy a 37.4% stake in Adani Gas Ltd., now called Adani Total Gas. In 2021, it bought a 20% stake in Adani Green as well as a 50% interest in some of Adani Green’s solar farms in operation in a $2.5 billion deal that was among the largest foreign investments in India.The bet on Adani Green worked well for Total as its value soared to $10 billion in 2022 when Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne described the stake as “a source of potential cash.”The duo were looking to partner up and fund billions of dollars worth of green hydrogen development in India.However, when Hindenburg Research accused the Adani Group of “brazen” market manipulation and accounting fraud earlier this year, Total put a plan to develop about $5 billion of green hydrogen projects with Adani Enterprises Ltd. on hold. The Adani Group strongly denied the allegations by the short-seller.Adani’s stocks and bonds have recouped some losses since the short-seller report, particularly after the group received investment from GQG Partners, and an interim report from an Indian Supreme Court-appointed panel in May said it found no evidence of stock-price manipulation. Adani Enterprises, which incubates the tycoon’s businesses, in the quarter through March reported that its profit doubled to 7.22 billion rupees ($87 million).Adani Green said in July that it plans to raise 123 billion rupees to bankroll expansion through selling shares to institutional investors."

These shares were bought at a price of Rs 20,297 per share, resulting in a total consideration of Rs 19,080.26 crore. This transaction was carried out in accordance with a scheme that had been approved by the Madras High Court.The income tax department argued that this changed the company's shareholding pattern, with the Cognizant Mauritius entity holding 76.68 percent of the shares.Rejecting the appeal of Cognizant Technology Solutions India, the tribunal ruled that the consideration paid by the company for the purchase of its own shares in accordance with the scheme sanctioned by the Madras High Court amounts to the distribution of accumulated profits, which attracts provisions of Sec.2(22) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.After examining the returns filed by Cognizant, the assessing officer determined that the company was liable to pay DDT. This decision was based on the assessment that the consideration paid by Cognizant to its shareholders constituted a reduction of capital under the relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. As a result, a demand of Rs 4,853.42 crore was raised against the company.The order of the ITAT said it was rightly held by the assessing officer and the CIT(A) that the transactions of purchase of its own shares ""is nothing but distribution of accumulated profits and reduction of capital which falls under the definition of dividend"".As per the relevant section of the Income Tax Act, when a company provides its shareholders with any of its accumulated profits, whether in the form of cash or assets, it is classified as a dividend. This means that if the company distributes cash or assets, such as shares, to its shareholders, it is considered a dividend for tax purposes.Following the Commission of Income Tax (Appeals) upheld the decision of the assessing officer, Cognizant filed an appeal with the Chennai bench of the ITAT to challenge the ruling. The appellate tribunal affirmed the decision that Cognizant was indeed liable to pay the dividend distribution tax.Also Read: Cognizant sees marginal dip in June quarter revenue, headcount down by 5,900The ITAT rejected Cognizant's argument that the scheme had received approval from the High Court and concluded that it was implemented as an attempt to evade legitimate taxes.

Morton when he was just 23 years old, some Byju’s lenders claim in a lawsuit. Morton’s fund received the money despite an apparent lack of formal training in investing, according to the lenders.","One of India’s hottest tech companies, Byju’s, allegedly hid $533 million in an obscure three-year-old hedge fund that once said its principal place of business was an IHOP pancake restaurant in Miami, according to lenders trying to recover the cash.Byju’s last year transferred more than half a billion dollars to Camshaft Capital Fund, the investment firm founded by William C. Morton when he was just 23 years old, some Byju’s lenders claim in a lawsuit. Morton’s fund received the money despite an apparent lack of formal training in investing, according to the lenders. What’s more, luxury cars —  a 2023 Ferrari Roma, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracán EVO, and a 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith — have been registered in Morton’s name since the transfer occurred, according to court papers.The allegations are the latest twist in an increasingly public battle between Byju’s, an India-based education tech firm, and lenders who claim the $533 million is collateral for a $1.2 billion loan. The two sides have been trading accusations about the loan, with lenders claiming it is in default and Byju’s accusing lenders of predatory tactics.“Byju’s has gone to great lengths to conceal the whereabouts of borrower’s $533 million for the admitted purpose of hindering and delaying” creditors, they argued in Miami-Dade County court filings.Byju’s, once India’s most valuable startup, is trying to strike a deal with creditors and this week made a surprise proposal to buy back the loan within six months. To bankroll that repayment, it’s in talks to sell some of its overseas assets to private equity and strategic investors. In an emailed statement late Tuesday US time, Byju’s said it’s not a party to the Florida court proceedings and hasn’t been served with copies of the lawsuit.Glas Trust, the agent for the creditors, hasn’t informed Camshaft about the lawsuit, the fund’s lawyers said. “Camshaft vigorously denies the statements made in Glas Trust Company’s” court filing, Camshaft lawyer David Massey said in an emailed statement.IHOP FundByju’s sent the money to Camshaft even though the hedge fund appears to cater to smaller clients. Camshaft accepts as little as $50,000 — “an extremely low threshold for a hedge fund,” lenders said in their court filing.In a 2020 Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Camshaft listed its principal business address as 285 NW 42nd Ave. Far from a typical office, that building is currently home to an IHOP. The diner in Miami’s Little Havana district is surrounded by a drive-through car wash and a strip mall that hosts a massage parlor and a sandwich shop.An employee on shift on a slow Tuesday afternoon served two families who sipped juice and munched on burgers while Blake Shelton’s “God’s Country” played in the restaurant. “A hedge fund? No,” the server, Ana, said with wide eyes.“If I had somebody coming in every day, or regularly, I’d recognize them,” she said.She said she’d never heard of Morton, Camshaft Capital Fund, or Byju’s and that the address had been home to the IHOP for decades. She’s worked there for 10 years and hasn’t noticed people doing anything that looked like a business deal.Miles away from that IHOP, an entity linked to Camshaft listed a swanky oceanfront condo at the Porsche Design Tower in Sunny Isles Beach — where the likes of Lionel Messi own homes — as its business address, court papers show.In an unrelated lawsuit filed by Camshaft in Miami in June, the hedge fund said its principal place of business is in the Virgin Islands.Cash FightThe missing cash has been at the heart of the lenders’ actions. The lenders’ agent, Glas Trust, won an early round in the fight by gaining control of the Byju’s unit that issued the debt. But by then, the cash had vanished. Byju’s was trying to protect the money from predatory lenders, a lawyer for Byju’s Alpha said during a court hearing in May. The company had a right to transfer the money under the loan agreement, the lawyer said.Byju’s has claimed in court that the lenders are seeking to take over the entire ed-tech empire, which is led by its founder, Byju Raveendran. Byju’s has asked a Delaware judge to reject the default declared by Glas.The company had been trying to strike a deal with creditors to restructure the facility, which itself is one of the biggest unrated term loan B offerings ever from a startup company.Since the company was founded in 2015, Raveendran has attracted capital from some of the biggest investors in the tech world, including Mark Zuckerberg’s Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Silver Lake Management and Naspers Ltd. Byju’s was valued at more than $20 billion last year when it considered merging with a special-purpose acquisition company.The lenders filed the lawsuit in order to trace the money and recover any excess management fees pay to Camshaft.Camshaft had not yet filed a response to the lawsuit as of Tuesday afternoon in Miami.The Miami lawsuit is Glas Trust Co. LLC V. Camshaft Capital Fund, LP, 2023-022640-CA-01, Miami-Dade County."

At the same time, October has been among the best, with an average gain for Apple of 3.8% over the same period.“If you’re a long-time holder and you see this as becoming a consumer staple company, these pullbacks are opportunities,” said Gene Munster, managing partner and co-founder of Deepwater Asset Management.While the stock has usually risen in the months ahead of the event, this year’s lead up has been troubled. Apple shares slumped in August after a disappointing earnings report and the slide has continued this month amid concerns about government restrictions on iPhones in China, its biggest international market. In total, Apple has lost nearly $300 billion in market value since closing at a record on July 31.The fears about China and the seasonality around the iPhone events have provided a compelling entry point, according to Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt Private Wealth.“The U.S. and China both need Apple to create employment and wealth for their respective nations,” he said. “These fundamental facts are unchanged by the recent media reports, and we expect Apple to successfully operate in China for many years to come.”Apple’s event is scheduled to kick off on Tuesday at 10 a.m. in California and feature the iPhone 15 line, along with next-generation watches and AirPods. The iPhone lineup will include two-entry level models and two high-end models, Bloomberg News has reported.Of course, Apple isn’t the only megacap stock under pressure. The Nasdaq 100 Stock Index has fallen more than 2% from a high in July amid rising Treasury yields and signs that the Federal Reserve is poised to keep interest rates higher for longer. Tesla Inc. and Microsoft Inc. have fallen more than 5% since the July 18 peak. Even chipmaker Nvidia Corp. is down 4.9%.Despite the pullback, Apple shares remain up 38% this year. The stock is priced at 27 times projected profits, down from a high of 30 times in July but well above an average of 18 times over the past decade.Apple is in need of a boost after three consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Analysts on average think the company’s annual revenue will bounce back in 2024, after dipping about 2.9% this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That will be helped by the firm raising prices of its higher-end models, said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, adding that this would be a positive catalyst for the stock.The recent performance has “hopefully set the stage for an October and year-end rally,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management.“I think we have to get through September, which obviously has been very choppy so far,” he said. “I’m an Apple bull, let’s put it out there, with the horns and everything.”"

While the vast majority of iPhone 15s will come from China, that would be the first time a latest generation, India-assembled device is available on the first day of sale, they said, asking not to be identified as the matter is private.It would also underscore India’s growing production prowess, and reflect a significant departure from Apple’s previous strategy of selling mostly Chinese-made new devices to frenzied customers across the world. The new iPhone 15 is expected to go on sale in the days or weeks after its unveiling, slated for 10 a.m. California time on Tuesday.Cupertino, California-based Apple began iPhone 15 production at supplier Foxconn Technology Group’s factory in southern Tamil Nadu state last month. That move was yet another effort by the US tech giant to further narrow the gap between its India operations and its main manufacturing bases in China.Slight delays with the India-built device could occur because of unforeseen logistics bottlenecks, the people said. Apple representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment.Apple is set to introduce the iPhone 15, updated watches and AirPods at a gala event at its US headquarters. Sales of new products begin typically around 10 days after the unveiling.Before the iPhone 14, Apple assembled just a fraction of its global output in India, which lagged behind China production by six to nine months. That delay was drastically reduced last year to just weeks, and Apple has increased the proportion of iPhones it assembles in India to reach 7% at the end of March.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s financial incentives to boost local manufacturing and Apple’s strategy to look beyond China amid a Washington-Beijing trade war have helped India become increasingly important to the iPhone maker’s diversification drive.The iPhone 15 is expected to be the biggest update to the device in three years. It will include upgrades to the camera system across the range, and the Pro models will gain an improved 3-nanometer processor. The new lineup is critical to reviving flagging sales. Apple in August reported its third straight quarter of declining sales, weighed down by tepid consumer demand in key markets like the US, China and Europe.Other Apple suppliers in India — Pegatron Corp. and a Wistron Corp. factory that is soon being acquired by the Tata Group — will also likely soon assemble the iPhone 15, Bloomberg News has reported.Apple, which opened its first India stores this year, views the fast-growing market as both a retail opportunity and an important production base for its gadgets in the longer term. In the quarter through June, iPhone sales in India grew at a double-digit rate to a new high, Apple said without revealing precise numbers."

That suggests investors are more concerned about repayment of the longer-dated debt."

It's giving a voice to many countries that may not have had a voice before.  In some cases, with the Global South, a wide span of countries ranging from the geographical regions of Africa, Central and Latin America, and a large chunk of Asia,"" he said.He further said,""What is more important is that India is uniquely positioned for bridging the divide between many countries in the world, in some cases a North-South divide, in some cases, the East-West divide.""India's benign, but assertive presidency is boosted by its successes and experiences, he said adding the country is ""orchestrating a collective voice to what was seen earlier as peripheral third world countries"".Shah also noted that India's presidency comes at a time of the country's ascendancy in international standing and global exposure and there is a greater inclination on the part of the world today to understand India, to recognise its capabilities and contributions.""India has a potential to serve as a competent balance while bridging complex issues and arguments. And this is one of the biggest reasons why the world is enthusiastically participating in India's G20 presidency,"" Shah asserted.The scale and execution of India's G20 presidency with over 200 meetings, 11 engagement groups, 12 working groups under the Sherpa track, eight under the finance track conducted in 50 cities across the length and breadth of the country have brought together various voices, perspectives, and have really enriched the discussions that have taken place, he noted.With teams working together developing blueprints for solving many of the pressing problems facing the world through consensus, Shah said a series of comprehensive actions have been taken that will ""create solutions that can be taken across the world, and that is the power of what India's G20 presidency has done"".On the road ahead for G20, Shah pointed out that issues such as debt restructuring of countries in debt,  high inflation and timelines for climate mitigation measures would need to be addressed.He pointed out that more than half of all low income countries are either in or near debt distress, which is double the number in 2015 and the IMF has warned that medium-term growth prospects remain weak and vulnerable countries are falling further behind.Citing the agreement on Zambia's USD 6.3 billion debt restructuring, he said the deal provided some cause for optimism ahead of the summit, adding,""If a template of common principles could be adopted, it will go a long way for countries in debt"".On inflation, Shah said,""This remains a major concern despite falling headline inflation; it is still well above central bank targets and core inflation is persistent. The G20 should recommit to achieving price stability through further interest rate rise when necessary and it should pledge to target fiscal measures to protect the most vulnerable while advocating for supply side policies to help increase labour supply and enhance productivity.""Highlighting climate change as a very important area, he said,""It will be interesting to see whether the G20 leaders can agree to the timelines for climate mitigation measures, and reach consensus on actions to support the energy transition ahead of the COP28 in November. India has taken leadership in various climate initiatives and hopefully that should be an impetus for others to come in as well."""

Getting in a partner with deep pockets and tech knowhow could make the UK bank smarter and faster, but sacrifice a share of future earnings","Barclays Plc is trying to work out how to make the best of its payments business in its quest to increase the appeal of its shares. One option is selling a stake in the unit that handles card transactions for shopkeepers and other businesses, Bloomberg News reports.That won’t be a shortcut to boosting the stock through advertising the high value put on an overlooked part of the group – the last refuge of uninspired executives. More likely, such a sale would be a way of injecting extra investment into the unit and bringing in the expertise of a tech-savvy partner to aid its development. Given Barclays’s returns on equity lag behind peers, getting some outside help could be the smart choice.It would be an odd time for Barclays to think about cashing out of the payments business. The field has high growth potential, but industry leaders such as Stripe Inc or Adyen NV have recently suffered steep drops in valuations. Barclays also needs to diversify its earnings and find more reliable income streams to offset its volatile corporate and investment bank. Deal-making, fundraising and trading used nearly 70 percent of Barclays’s equity capital, while producing 53 percent of revenue last year.Several European and US banks sold their payments units after the 2008 financial crisis as a way of raising capital. NatWest Group Plc – formerly Royal Bank of Scotland – offloaded the business that became WorldPay Inc, for example. But since then, the rapid growth of online retail and a wave of investment in fintech startups have seen the dull backwater of processing and settlement become a hotbed of innovation.Payments businesses are being turned into the entry point for selling other services, from lending and bank accounts to tax, accounting and company formation. US institutions like JPMorgan Chase & Co are investing billions to catch up with younger companies like Stripe in combining such tools and selling them as a package to airlines, carmakers and online marketplaces like Amazon.com Inc.The field has come to be known as embedded finance, and the revenue could more than double to $51 billion in 2026 from $21 billion in 2021 in the US alone, according to forecasts by consultants at Bain & Company last year.It’s not for everyone, though. If Goldman Sachs Group Inc ends up quitting its credit card deal with Apple Inc, as well as selling its home-improvementlending business GreenSky, that would mark a swift end to its nascent foray into the area. Some incumbents have also struggled to keep up with the faster, lower-cost tech companies that have invaded the territory. Fidelity National Information Services, Inc is spinning off Worldpay, which it only acquired in 2019, after it started losing small and medium-sized business customers to challengers.Elsewhere, deals and tie-ups continue apace: Visa Inc in June announcedthe $1 billion acquisition of Brazil’s Pismo, while in Europe both Worldline SA of France and Italy’s Nexi Spa continue to hunt out partners and targets.Barclays has previously flagged payments and related services as a focus for investment and growth as a complement to its strong US and UK credit-card businesses. While that shouldn’t change, it is a fast-moving field that needs heavy investment to keep up. But Barclays returns on equity are weaker than rivals, which leaves it with a tough choice: Spending what is required to compete in payments will hold back profits today in exchange for a potentially bigger prize in future; getting in a partner with deep pockets and tech knowhow could make the UK bank smarter and faster, but sacrifice a share of future earnings.Stake sales for their own sakes are just the kind of purposeless fiddling loved by consultants and bored investment bankers. Barclays should only do it with payments if it promises true benefits to that business.Paul J Davies is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering banking and finance.

Meta, she emphasised, ""welcomes constructive regulations"", and will wait to see the detailed rules.Devanathan, who is the Vice President of Meta in India, also spoke of the company's determination to crack down on misinformation on the platform and outlined how it is harnessing AI (Artificial Intelligence) to pro-actively curb hateful content.Meta will continue with its election integrity efforts, as India heads for Lok Sabha elections next year, she said.India is among Meta's largest user bases globally - 400 million users of Facebook were here at the last count and growing.She said the user growth trajectory is strong. Overall, the possibilities offered by the Indian market are ""limitless"", backed by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, Digital Public Infrastructure, and other factors.For Meta, India is also one of the most engaged markets in short-form videos both in terms of creation and consumption of 'Reels', Devanathan said. ""Meta India is innovating for Meta globally"" and there is also a massive momentum in small businesses using Meta platforms and tools.A significant number of businesses in India are on Meta, using its platforms to set up their first presence on the internet and to find and communicate with customers, she pointed out.To a question on Facebook losing appeal among teens and young adult users across key markets, signalling a clear shift in preferences, Devanathan asserted that Facebook continues to see traction and relevance among users of all age groups.Devanathan said she does not agree with the perception of a slow decline of Facebook with younger audiences.""India is a huge priority market for the company. So, India has one of our largest user bases, be it on Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp. But equally, India is also the place where we test a lot of what we roll out globally as well. It has also been where we develop a lot of our innovative products and that investment will continue,"" she said.India's vision of a USD 1 trillion digital economy by 2030 is a significant tailwind for opportunities, she noted.""And that number is going to mean that tech companies will have tailwinds of a growing economy. Equally, you are looking at almost a billion people on the internet in not the very distant future, of which 400 million are expected to shop online...also look at the video consumption numbers...So there is this huge headroom not just for Meta, but for a whole lot of other companies as well,"" she said.Moreover, the advertising dollars as a percentage of GDP, is one of the lowest for India as compared to other markets. That number for the US is at about 1.9 per cent with India at a sub 0.5 per cent.Meta sees India as a ""huge priority market"" to innovate, engage with users, and for business to grow.Devanathan said Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram serve a wide spectrum of users.""Facebook has actually a very thriving active community. So, I would debunk any myth...in terms of Facebook's numbers... we just announced a few months ago that the daily activities on Facebook are growing, and just touched 2 billion and that's a huge number of daily activities that we reported,"" she said.People use Facebook to come together and connect with friends, family, and community and that underlying appeal ""hasn't changed"".""When you look at the 2 billion number...it is across-the-board. Facebook is very much a thriving platform across the world,"" she said, emphasising that the slow decline of Facebook is not happening.On the new regulatory framework emerging in India -- the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, Digital India legislation in the offing, and existing social media rules -- she said Meta welcomes ""constructive"" regulations.""What DPDP has done is, it has provided a framework for tech companies to operate in and has provided clarity. We are waiting for the rules to get written out. But I would say that this is a great step in balancing user protection with innovations...because that is what will power India techade so we welcome constructive regulation and let's see where we go from here,"" she said.India is one of the biggest markets for social media companies such as Meta, Google, and X (formerly Twitter), with its booming smartphone sales and availability of dirt cheap data supercharging growth for digital platforms.That said, social media companies, over the past years, have drawn flak globally and in India over issues of user harm and the circulation of misinformation, hate speech, and fake news on their platforms. There is also a growing discontent among a section of users who allege that digital platforms have been indulging in arbitrary acts in taking down content, or not responding fast enough to grievances, despite users red-flagging them.India has tightened rules for social media companies, increasing their accountability to users. In fact, the government has time and again emphasised that safety and trust are public policy objectives and mission, and it will do all it takes to ensure suitable safeguards are in place for digital citizens navigating online and social media space."

It is another thing when your home is shining and then you tell others these are some of the things you can do.""India's position to make an ""impact on some of these major global issues, on the countries of the world is much, much better than it ever has been"", he asserted.On the road ahead for G20, Bhargava said, ""Brazil and whoever succeeds after that will be inspired by what has been done in India and will carry forward the kind of momentum which had been built for G20.""It should not again become less important to the world in the future, he said, adding, ""We have raised the stature of G20, we have raised the importance of G20. The G20 has been given a certain recognition of its ability to influence people in the world. I think that Brazil should carry it forward...I'm sure they will do their best.""Reflecting on how India has been able to use the G20 platform to showcase itself and promote different parts of the countries, Bhargava said, ""(while the G20 presidency rotates)...I have not ever seen any country take the kind of opportunity G20 apparently was offering but which only Mr Modi seems to recognise.""He added the prime minister recognised that ""G20 has certain opportunities for countries like India, at least to showcase its own development, to exhibit what is happening in this country, to raise the profile of the country and also to use the G20 to make a lot of changes and improvements and attitudinal differences in different parts of the country. Giving the example of the way subcommittees of the G20 were organised in different parts of the country and what it led to, Bhargava said, ""I think it's quite remarkable that we took this kind of advantage of our presidency of G20 to completely raise the profile of the conference and what the conference would do for a country like ours."""

The bank has installed Dipak Gupta as its interim chief executive until the end of the year.The banking billionaire is expecting that his early departure will put some distance between his larger-than-life sway over the bank and the new leader who will take charge on January 1, 2024, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public. This may make RBI more amenable to approving Manian as his successor, they said.Kotak’s resignation “is entirely voluntary and not as a result of any concerns expressed by the regulator,” a spokesperson for the bank said in an emailed statement. The lender has submitted two names to the RBI for the role and is awaiting the regulators’ approval, according to the statement. A spokesperson for RBI didn’t respond to an email seeking comment.Kotak received shareholder approval earlier in the year to remain on the board for a period of five years after stepping down from his role as the bank’s leader. This defied the spirit of a RBI rule that outgoing heads of financial institutions should take a three-year cooling period after their tenor to ensure a clean break, the people said.Outside Candidate“Kotak has the ability to attract and retain good talent and has fostered governance beyond its legal necessity,” said Abizer Diwanji, head of financial services of Ernst & Young LLP. “Passing on the baton to someone new would require him to walk the talk on the same governance issues of independent thought and drive to be able for someone to lead the bank the way he did.”In 1985, Kotak started a bill discounting company, which he grew into a financial services conglomerate, with the fourth-largest private lender in India as its flagship. Kotak Mahindra has seldom hired senior managers from its peers and instead relied on creating leaders internally.An outsider as CEO would face challenges in adjusting to the bank’s culture and could potentially reduce shareholder value, the people said.Manian, who joined the bank in 1994, heads corporate, institutional and investment banking at Kotak Mahindra Bank since April 2014. Manian also oversees the firm’s institutional equities business. Another internal contender Shanti Ekambaram, has been with the bank since 1991, and heads the consumer banking business at the lender.“The general belief among peer bankers is that an outsider should be given serious consideration for the CEO role, especially if the right perception is to be conveyed to the market,” said Sourabh Chattopadhyay, a Mumbai-based managing partner with executive search firm Wellesley Partners. “While the internal candidates are highly capable, they may face increased scrutiny from the regulators.”"

However, it was an on-field injury which resulted in a shift to finance.He started off with bill discounting, turned to lending and successfully applied to starting a universal bank in the first decade of the millennium, as India was warming up to private play in banking.In a four-decade journey in the financial services space, Uday Kotak can boast of many firsts and some deft business moves, which illustrate the convictions with which he operated.Kotak, the 64-year-old founder-promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank, is the richest banker in the country by virtue of owning 26 per cent of the bank which was valued at over Rs 3.5 lakh crore as of Friday's close.The private sector lender he founded is the only one sporting the family name, and till Friday, had a family member at the helm as the managing director and chief executive officer in an industry where professional managers have the strongest currency.When he stunned all with the decision to acquire ING Vysya Bank in an all-share deal, the transaction was the biggest in the private sector banking space as of then. The merger did not face any regulatory roadblocks and the integration was smooth.However, the issue of promoter stake was Kotak's biggest worry all through the journey as a universal bank and the RBI didn't budge on the insistence to bring it down to 15 per cent for the longest time.Investors loved the bank's consistent earnings growth and relatively cleaner books, and Kotak struggled to get his stake down to what the RBI was comfortable with.He also attempted to do so with a complex instrument, which did not meet the regulatory muster, and finally, in an unprecedented move, the bank dragged RBI to the Bombay High Court over the issue.Kotak won the first round with the RBI under newly appointed Governor Shaktikanta Das agreeing to allow promoters of KMB to hold a 26 per cent stake, which led to the withdrawal of the case.However, the RBI's norms on leadership appointments at private sector banks -- reviewed after the Yes Bank debacle where Co-founder Rana Kapoor's workings led to catastrophic consequences -- led to Kotak's exit from the bank in an executive role.The RBI capped the maximum tenure of a managing director and chief executive officer at 15 years, due to which Kotak was set to retire at the end of his term in December 2023, which has now been cut short.Kotak announced that he will be a non-executive director on the bank's board, but also went public against the bureaucratic approach in financial sector regulations. The remarks in his last message to shareholders as the CEO is reported to have disappointed the RBI brass.All through his career, outspoken Kotak went with his convictions and was arguably the rare voice in the banking space who went public with his concerns on demonetisation. Recently, he also spoke disparagingly against the US Dollar, which was withdrawn later.Probably, what made such assertions possible was Kotak's heft as a banker, with KMB's financials speaking the loudest, forcing all to take note of what he has to say on a topic.He also helped out regulators and policy makers leading efforts to draft corporate governance guidelines, and efforts to resolve the IL&FS mess.A part of Kotak's legacy stays on in the bank he founded, with his son Jay rising to be a vice president and Co-head of the ""811"" initiative.In his resignation letter, Kotak said the bank has taken necessary steps on succession, and now awaits the RBI's decision."

This will help the company recover bad loans it buys and boost its income, he said.ARCIL, with assets of more than 162 billion rupees, is looking to acquire soured debt from “promising” sectors such as renewable energy, road, steel and logistics. It may bring Avenue Capital as a co-investor, Mohapatra said.While Indian banks have cut back on the sale of bad loans to local asset reconstruction companies in recent years, the market has grown as the economy gradually recovers from the pandemic. The nation’s lenders wrote off bad loans worth 2.09 trillion rupees in the year that ended March 2023, up 20% from the previous year.The bad loan buyer, known as asset reconstruction company in local parlance, purchases assets through a combination of cash and security receipt, an instrument issued in lieu of upfront cash. ARCIL bought soured debt of about $500 million in the 12 months to March, up from $340 million in the preceding year.“Being the oldest asset reconstruction company we are keen to get the technical industry knowhow from global investors while we know the business of bad loans,” Mohapatra said.Still, as the sector recovers from a shadow banking crisis in 2018, the Reserve Bank of India sees the gross bad-loan ratio of local banks falling to 3.6% by March, from a 10-year low of 3.9% a year earlier."

The network aims at helping MSME players in the retail sectors to take advantage of the fast growing e-commerce space in the country.The report said that the ONDC presents an opportunity for financial institutions to engage with MSMEs segment that is mainly dependent on government schemes and non-baking financial companies (NBFCs) for credit as they are not deemed creditworthy by mainstream financial institutions.The size of lending does not make it profitable for financial institutions to lend to this sector, and the lack of data related to MSMEs has meant that credit approvals, based on traditional decisioning models in most instances, get rejected.""The ONDC ecosystem is expected to digitise the data available on SMEs (using the transaction data) with the help of financial technology services providers... The digitised data will enable financial institutions to develop better understanding of this client segment to tailor products and services,"" the report/whitepaper titled 'commerce@Bharat: Redefining business models and supply chain', said.It added that the increased adoption of ONDC in smaller cities and rural areas will open newer segments for banks and also drive tailored products and services catering to this segment's needs.""The MSME segments have been traditionally dominated by regional players. ONDC opens up opportunities for digital-savvy financial institutions to cater to the segment,"" it said.A recent report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) committee on MSMEs stated that the sector has an estimated credit gap of Rs 20-25 lakh crore.About the manufacturing sector, the report said that the manufacturing environment has become more challenging during and after the Covid pandemic with geopolitical tensions leading to changes in the trade landscape, supply chain disruptions, and component shortages and volatile commodity prices.""ONDC is likely to enable the manufacturing community to tap some of these opportunities and address challenges across the value chain,"" it said, adding, with the availability of a large pool of logistics service providers on ONDC, organisations can optimise overall logistics cost and manage demand increase more effectively.The network will help manage supply chain disruptions in the manufacturing sector as on ONDC, the original equipment makers can quickly identify alternative supply sources at competitive prices from an extensive pool of suppliers and order the component to ensure zero disruption in manufacturing operations.It also said that with the increasing importance of online sales, the retail ecosystem (brands, retailers, distributors, suppliers) can use the network to connect within their ecosystem and with end consumers.Over the past few months, categories such as grocery, food delivery, home and decor, electronics, fashion and lifestyle, beauty and personal care, and pharmaceuticals have been leveraging the ONDC network with support of multiple stakeholders.""ONDC creates an opportunity for brands/retailers/MSMEs to efficiently and cost effectively address their demand and supplier connect. There are exciting possibilities in both B2B and B2C commerce,"" it said, adding brands and retailers can use this network by onboarding their physical outlets and distribution points/warehousing.It added that the network can support brands to connect directly with their retailers and/or enable their distributors to expand their reach and coverage.They can also provide features and services such as 24x7 ordering, next-day delivery, auto ordering, and credit management to their sales partners, the report said.It added that the ONDC can also offer brands/retailers to expand their supplier base and reduce cost of procuring raw materials or manufacturing products.Further, about the agriculture sector, it said ONDC will provide an opportunity to accelerate technology adoption in agriculture throughout the country as it can integrate both buyers and sellers across the farm value chain onto a single network.""The network might come as a boon for agritech start-ups that face a challenge of discoverability. FPOs will get access to input, technology, equipment, and services from companies and government bodies,"" it said.Commenting on the report, Sathish Gopalaiah, President, Consulting, Deloitte South Asia, said that ONDC is a remarkable opportunity for India's economy spanning diverse industries.""With a unique proposition built around agility, security and profitability at the same time, ONDC streamlines value chains, bridges gaps, and endorses innovation, paving the way for the next generation to explore novel paths,"" he added."

The crisis forced him to shelve a $2.5 billion share sale and convince banks about his business credentials.India's Supreme Court later appointed a panel to oversee a market regulator probe based on the Hindenburg report. The panel in May said the regulator had so far ""drawn a blank"" in investigations into suspected violations in overseas investments in the Adani Group.Last week, the regulator said its report was nearing completion and its investigation on some offshore deals was taking time as some entities were located in tax haven jurisdictions. The regulator ""shall take appropriate action based on outcome of the investigations,"" it said.The regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the OCCRP report.The OCCRP report on Thursday named two individual investors who made the investments it investigated for its article - Nasser Ali Shaban Ahli and Chang Chung-Ling - described by OCCRP as ""longtime business partners"" of the Adani family.The media organization said there was no evidence Chang and Ahli's money for their investments came from the Adani family, but said its reporting and documents - including an agreement, corporate records and an email - showed there ""is evidence"" that their trading in Adani stock ""was coordinated with the family.""""The question of whether this arrangement is a violation of the law rests on whether Ahli and Chang should be considered to be acting on behalf of Adani 'promoters,' a term used in India to refer to the majority owners of a business,"" OCCRP said.If so, OCCRP said, their stake in Adani holdings would exceed the 75% limit allowed for insider ownership.Ahli and Chang did not respond to OCCRP's requests for comment, the news article said. Reuters could not immediately reach Ahli and Chang for comment.In an interview with a reporter from the Guardian, OCCRP said Chang said he knew nothing about any secret purchases of Adani stock. He asked why journalists were not interested in his other investments and said, ""We are a simple business."""

The excerpts are lightly edited for clarity:Outlook on India economyBusinesses that are indexed to Indian consumption are fairly resilient. Anything that is more integrated with global supply chains, whether it’s exports or certain commodities, there is volatility and some weakness there. What we are growing at without exports firing is a decent number.The impact on consumption has been more inflation-led and inflation has actually been mostly imported. The second factor is climate emergency because it’s led to crop failures. As inflation is moderating the latest Nielsen numbers also show some green shoots of pick up in the rural economy. What is to be monitored is the El Nino bit and the global dynamic is still uncertain, but as the inflation is cooling off consumption is picking up.Impact of export bansIt is impacting us. As businesses we have to be also responsible. People have to have food in the country. So we have to understand that and people have to be able to afford it. These are realities we must recognize.I obviously hope that it is short lived. And what will enable us to export is our crops doing well, our agriculture producing more than is required so that we have the surpluses. As a responsible corporate this is what I would like to work with the farming community on and see how we can improve the produce.Viability of agri businessMy focus at this point of time is on value addition (rather than pure output growth that could impact prices and overall profitability). For example, we inaugurated the spices facility and we are now going to inaugurate the nicotine derivative products facility.That’s the path we are on — building capacity in medicinal and aromatic plants, horticulture and aquaculture. These are the areas of value add we are focusing on as a company. And this is more value accretive than the commodity business in any case."

The world’s third-largest emitter is also moving to wean itself off coal — which generates about 70% of its power — and has plans to expand into clean-energy technologies.Hindustan Zinc will spend $1 billion over the next decade to cut its current dependence on coal, said Agarwal Hebbar, who also sits on the board of Vedanta and helms the ESG vertical of the group. Most of that money would go toward replacing coal as the major energy source for its smelters with solar and wind, she said.A deal with Serentica Renewables, who will supply Hindustan Zinc with 450 megawatts of solar and wind power a year, will help cut coal use at its smelters in half by the end of 2025, Agarwal Hebbar said. The company is also targeting 75% electrification of its fleet of mining vehicles by 2035 and 100% five years later, she said.It’s also possible that the zinc producer will expand into mining or refining of metals that are crucial to the energy transition.In June, New Delhi released a list of minerals — including copper, lithium and nickel — that it considers critical for its economic growth and where it sees supply risks. It also amended mining laws last month to make it easier for private miners to search for some minerals including lithium.Hindustan Zinc is open to buying critical metals assets, Agarwal Hebbar said. It’s a “very exciting time,” she said. “Whatever seems relevant for us, we will definitely consider it.”"

And yet, so much for the pervasive perception of paralysis.Not only does Los Angeles still work, its 10 largest publicly-traded companies are No. 1 in sales and employee growth among the same group of firms based in each of the 10 most-populated US cities now and for the foreseeable future, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Los Angeles's top 10 run the gamut from banks, financial services and insurance to consumer discretionary and staples to industrials and healthcare. Ares Management Corp, Houlihan Lokey Inc, Air Lease Corp, KB Home, Korn Ferry, Cathay General Bancorp, Radnet Inc, Sweetgreen Inc, Mercury General Corp and Oaktree Specialty Lending Corp posted an average 90 percent increase in sales during the past five years with revenue estimated to rise 16 percent this year, 22 percent in 2024 and 16 percent in 2025.

Radnet Inc, the No. 1 US provider of outpatient diagnostic imaging services, continues to outperform its global competitors with a 68 percent gain to shareholders this year after appreciating 10 times during the past decade.For all the handwringing over the 3 percent decline in population to 3.7 million since 2020, the high cost of housing and homelessness, the City of Angels still benefits from America's largest (500,000) manufacturing base and almost a dozen industries collectively distinguished by their diversity: aerospace, biosciences, design, entertainment, electric vehicles and advanced transportation, fashion and apparel, food manufacturing, information technology, ocean economy, tourism and trade. More than 92 percent of Los Angeles commerce is small business.“There's this certain kind of ambition, swagger in LA that makes people want to do very ambitious things and I think propels people to dream very big,” said Tim Ellis, the 33-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer of Relativity Space, an eight-year-old startup that made the first 3D printed rocket to enter space. (Reality's 110-foot Terran 1 was the largest metal object 3D printed.) “Most of my friends are engineers, but I'm friends with tons of artists and tons of people in fashion and other industries. That's the kind of innovation and mentality that it would take to do something as crazy as put a million people (on) Mars,” he said during a 2022 interview with Bloomberg News.Ellis, who grew up in Plano, Texas, and holds bachelors and masters degrees in aerospace engineering from the University of Southern California, is a lodestar for Dee Dee Myers, a senior advisor to California Governor Gavin Newsom and director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development. “We have the most highly-skilled workforce, we have more engineers, more Nobel laureates, more patents and all of that continues to turn the wheel of the economy,” Myers said last month in an interview at the Los Angeles bureau of Bloomberg News.Since she became Los Angeles's 43rd mayor last December, Karen Bass is all too familiar with “prominent business CEOs” talking “about the dire situation in our city and state. If it was such a terrible business environment, why would you have all this data” suggesting success for the city’s biggest companies, she said during a Zoom interview earlier this month. Sure enough, more than 10,500 new businesses were launched since Bass took office.As “a born and raised Angeleno,” she said, “you don't think about how large we are until you interact on the national level,” where she served in Congress as the 26th chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, “and there are many state populations as well as economies that could fit inside our state. That gives me the confidence that when we hit speedbumps, we will not only survive but thrive.”-With assistance from Shin Pei.Matthew A Winkler, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus of Bloomberg News, writes about markets.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/office-mandates-pit-spouse-against-spouse-11271071.html,Office mandates pit spouse against spouse,"August 28, 2023 05:36 PM IST","Men took on more household responsibilities during the pandemic, but work attendance rules risk undercutting that progress","The return-to-office tug of war is playing out not only between bosses and employees but between spouses. Corporate insistence that workers show up at the office sets up a conflict between two-career couples at home.Many households established new routines during the work-from-home era that allowed them to divvy up responsibilities — grocery shopping, laundry, waiting for the electrician — more equitably than in the past. And the earlier, voluntary stages of the RTO push allowed couples leeway to decide who would commute on which days.But as executives demand more days in the office and set stricter team schedules, the ebbing of flexibility is creating a mounting sense of alarm that the future will look an awful lot like the past, when women sacrificed their careers to make time for their higher share of household labor.A strong RTO push is likely to blunt the gains of the last two years — when US women reached new highs in labor force participation and men a new level of unpaid household work. It was nowhere near equality, but we were heading in the right direction.Backsliding isn’t inevitable if employers remain open to hybrid schedules. A 2018 study looked at research from 45 countries and found that employer support was the single most important factor in mitigating work-life conflict.Because spouses aren’t just negotiating between themselves, of course. A third party is influencing the debate: employers, which have the power to grant (or deny) employees’ requests for flexibility. And historical data shows they are less likely to approve requests from men.A 2016 analysis from Bain & Company in Australia found that men’s applications for flexible work arrangements were twice as likely to be rejected as women’s. (Other data shows a similar disparity in the UK.) Although such arrangements increased women’s job satisfaction, they seemed to have the opposite effect on men, who said they had been stigmatised by upper management. One manager actually said it out loud to a man who had asked about going part-time: “Part-time is traditionally only something we make work for women.”Men are more likely to be punished for explicitly seeking work-life balance because of an outdated assumption about the division of household labor: that a married woman will cut back at work and that a man (regardless of marital status) will always be on call.Bain’s study jibes with earlier academic research in the US that found that men pay a higher penalty than women for seeking flexible work arrangements. This is particularly true when men explain that the reason for their request is to take on traditionally female tasks, like caring for children. Perhaps sensing this, men are less likely to ask.A 2015 study found that male consultants were criticised for taking even a two-week parental leave; men at the same firm who took three-week vacations weren’t. And men who were sneaky about seeking work-family balance — by, say, carefully arranging their phone calls to appear busy all day when in reality they were with their kids — faced no repercussions. Perhaps that’s why men were much more likely to ask for forgiveness rather than permission for working flexibly.But today, tightening office presence requirements will make it much harder to find balance through under-the-radar schedule chicanery. Companies have started tracking badge swipes, keyboard strokes and computer idle time. And about a third of companies are calling hybrid workers into the office on specific days. Employers that are willing to make exceptions are asking workers to submit formal applications — a route women have been more willing to take than men in decades past.And now, women are slower to return than men, with 41 percent saying that they worked from home at least some of the time in 2022, down just half a percentage point from the year before. Over the same period, men’s WFH rate dropped 7 percentage points to 28 percent. The cause is presumed to be that women prefer working from home because it allows them to juggle work and life; but it could also be evidence that employers are less willing to grant men flexibility and that men are more hesitant to ask for it.Such employer attitudes foster inequities at home that can lead to simmering resentments.The evidence shows that most couples engage in a little bit of self-deception about the balance of labor in their relationships. In surveys of two-career heterosexual couples, women are more likely to say that each partner’s career is equally important, while men are more likely to say their own career gets priority. Economic data suggests the men are right. But men are much less clear-eyed when it comes to household labor; there, it’s men who express egalitarian ideals but consistently overestimate their contribution to housework.What this says to me is that couples today want to share the load equally — women to be equal partners in earning and men to be equal partners at home. But something gets in the way. A big part of that “something” is employer attitudes and policies.Sarah Green Carmichael is a Bloomberg Opinion editor. Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.Credit: Bloomberg "

Loan repayment ability of India Inc improves despite rising interest ratesThe ability of Indian companies to repay debt is improving despite rising interest rates, according to a Mint analysis of 382 companies on the BSE 500 index. The interest coverage ratio of these listed firms stood at 7.02 times in the June quarter, better than 6.73 times in the preceding three months. The ratio, derived by dividing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by interest cost, is still lower than 7.22 times in the year-ago period.Why it’s important: Corporations have improved operating performance on cheaper inputs. They were helped by lower working capital requirements and significant debt reduction over the past few years, thus avoiding a crisis in a tighter monetary regime.#2. Brookfield to grow $25 billion asset portfolio in India on increased opportunityGlobal asset manager Brookfield is looking to grow its $25 billion portfolio in India, said former British central banker Mark Carney, who is also the UN special envoy for climate action and finance. Brookfield is upbeat on India’s data infrastructure and energy transition space although it might not set up an India-specific fund, which is its policy for any other nation, Carney said.Why it’s important: India is seeing rapid expansion in energy transition, a sector that interests Brookfield significantly. It is already one of the biggest investors in India set to grow bigger.#3. After Chandrayaan-3 success, L&T to bet big on commercial satellite launch businessAfter playing a crucial role in the Chandrayaan-3 mission, Larsen & Toubro is looking to make a mark in the commercial satellite launch business and bid for the transfer of technology of the small satellite launch vehicle developed by the Indian Space Research Organization, company executives said. These rockets are capable of carrying a payload of up to 500 kg to low Earth orbit.Why it’s important: India has emerged as a low-cost destination to launch satellites. The technology transfer will be the first time when a space agency provides launch vehicle tech to a private party.#4. E-commerce, FMCG firms drive demand for electric vehicles in IndiaDemand for electric vehicles by e-commerce firms and consumer goods makers of daily essentials has doubled from last year, executives said. Amazon, Hindustan Unilever, Swiggy, Coca-Cola, Zomato, Amul, Flipkart, BigBasket and Bisleri are among the larger firms switching to electric vehicles EVs to service consumers and retailers.Why it’s important: Companies are rushing to meet carbon emission reduction targets and also looking to cut cost by half by switching to electric vehicles. The demand would only grow in the medium term.#5. New framework to ensure banks will not covertly auction stressed loansPrivate deals that some banks enter with acquirers of stressed loans will soon come to an end. Under a new framework that banks agreed on last week, lenders will have to ensure the decision to auction loans is notified to all key players in the market. This will end the practice of pushing through a sale by putting out the auction advertisement in an innocuous newspaper while keeping many potential bidders in the dark.Why it’s important: Increased transparency in disposing off bad loans is a welcome move since all high street lenders have agreed on the framework. A code of conduct to enable wider participation in loan sale deals was much needed.#6. Adani Group unlikely to face serious penal action as regulator found no major lapsesThe Securities and Exchange Board of India, directed by the Supreme Court to investigate whether the Adani Group violated laws, has not unearthed any major lapses and the conglomerate is unlikely to face serious regulator action. The regulator has been able to establish only one key allegation on non-disclosure of related-party transactions, which could make the group liable for a penalty of up to Rs 1 crore.Why it’s important: The capital market regulator is expected to submit its report to the Supreme Court on August 29. Any lack of unfavorable findings would come as a major relief to the Adani Group, which faced a market rout earlier in the year but steadfastly denied wrongdoing.#7. Unknown entity took Rs 600 crore position on Adani Enterprises ahead of status reportA single market participant took a derivatives position worth an estimated Rs 600 crore in Adani Enterprises, flagship firm of the Adani Group and a Nifty constituent, just days before the market regulator submitted its status report on the conglomerate to the Supreme Court on August 25. It’s unknown whether the position is a hedge or a punt. Such positions are usually taken in anticipation of a sharp price move based on any event.Why it’s important: The names of the investors or traders holding a major part of open positions on an underlying stock’s derivatives contracts should be disclosed in the interest of transparency, just as rules mandate identifying investors holding a percentage or more of the equity capital of a listed firm.#8. SoftBank India made over $5.5 billion from exits in past five yearsSoftBank Investment Advisors has earned more than $5.5 billion in exits from its India portfolio since it began operations in November 2018 in Mumbai, according to managing partner Sumer Juneja. Of the total, about $1.5 billion was booked in the last 12-18 months. Another $1.5 billion is liquid and in tradable equities.Why it’s important: SoftBank in recent has made partial exits in startups such as Lenskart and FirstCry and booked profits from listed startups such as Paytm, Zomato, Delhivery and PolicyBazaar, while still holding stake in them. It seems to have weathered the sharp correction in the tech sector.#9. Financial reporting authority to list frequent lapses for auditors and company managementsThe National Financial Reporting Authority will soon issue a circular outlining the frequently observed deviations in the preparation of financial statements and statutory audits to give guidance to managements and auditors on practices they should strictly avoid. These deviations have been noticed in specific cases during investigations and audit quality reviews done by authority in the past few years.Why it’s important: India has in recent years tightened oversight on corporate governance. Companies and auditors would do well to note the deviations and make efforts to avoid them.#10. Top Microsoft executive says India has got data protect legislation rightThe Indian government has got the new data bill right, applying strong protection for personal data while allowing cross-border data flow, said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s vice chairman and president and the second-ranking executive after CEO Satya Nadella. It's a sound and strong framework, and consistent with global standards, Smith said.Why it’s important: The endorsement to the proposed data protection law by a Big Tech firm underscores the government’s successful stakeholder outreach. Cross-border data flow was a big concern for multinational companies."

Microsoft, he pointed out, has more employees here today than it did 12 months ago.India's Digital Public Infrastructure also got a ringing endorsement from the Microsoft senior executive, who praised the nation's ""leadership"" in digital technology. No other country in the world has seen as much progress since 2020 as India when it comes to digital technology, he pointed out.India's digital public infrastructure is not just advancing but has drawn increased interest from other nations who want to replicate it, he said on the triad of identity, payments and data management framework being showcased by the country.""When I look at the situation here in India today in comparison to say 12 months ago when I was here, what we're seeing is this digital public infrastructure not only continuing to advance here, but increasingly other countries wanting to embrace it. So this G20 meeting is, I think, a very important opportunity for India. It is a showcase for the world of everything that is going forward here, including India's leadership in digital technology,"" he said.On the need for global guardrails on AI, he affirmed that laws and regulations will indeed be required.""We need to make safety a priority and that does require that kind of law or regulation. I don't think it's really possible to slow the pace of technology. So I don't think the answer is to ask technology developers to slow down. I think the answer is to ask those of us who really implement controls, safeguards and laws to move faster,"" he advocated.To a question about prominent tech voices sounding an alarm about the dangers posed to humanity by AI, Smith said he is optimistic about the technology but that there is a need to embrace ""the enormous responsibility that we have"".""I think we should get up every morning and look at both sides of that coin in a very clear-eyed way. If we do that, if we think broadly, if we act with determination, we will serve humanity well. That has to be our first priority,"" he said adding that building safeguards is ""quite rightly"" one of the big topics of discussion in 2023.It is pertinent to mention here that over the past months, many global experts and tech leaders have cautioned about the existential threat to humanity from AI, arguing that it needs to be considered a societal risk at par with pandemics and nuclear wars.The rise of AI and large language models (generative AI) have led to growing alarm on the potential harms of artificial intelligence, including its possible weaponisation to spread misinformation and propaganda, or even its role in culling millions of white-collar jobs."

Unlike in an IPO, no shares are sold in advance in a direct listing and investors can sell their shares directly to the public.In March 2021, the company brought on Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman, a software industry veteran behind some big IPOs, on its board.Founded in 2012, Instacart is led by Fidji Simo, who was previously head of the Facebook app.The company filed for the IPO as ""Maplebear,"" the name under which it was incorporated."

Another Rs 60,000 crore is planned to be invested in setting up a giant petrochemical complex at Paradip in Odisha.","India's top fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation will invest over Rs 4 lakh crore in this decade to expand oil refining and petrochemical business as well as in energy transition projects as part of a plan to become a '360-degree energy company', its chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said on Friday.IndianOil will invest Rs 1 lakh crore in expanding capacity to refine and turn crude oil into fuel and a staggering Rs 2.4 lakh crore in projects that will help it achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its operations. Another Rs 60,000 crore is planned to be invested in setting up a giant petrochemical complex at Paradip in Odisha.These investments will help the company continue to meet the rising energy needs of a fast-expanding economy while also treading on the path of the energy transition, he told company shareholders at the annual general meeting.Vaidya said the past year witnessed waves of volatility that rocked the global energy dynamics but IOC kept its promise of fuelling the nation with unwavering commitment.""As India's energy custodians, your company has crafted a clear roadmap to drive India's energy destiny,"" he told shareholders.""To fuel the rising energy demand of an ascendant India, we are committed to increasing our share in India's energy pie from the current 9 per cent to around 1/8th or 12.5 per cent by 2050.""For this, IOC is leveraging varied energy pathways that will establish it ""as a 360-degree energy company,"" he said. ""We are well-aligned with the need to ensure equitable energy access and sustainable transition."" The firm which controls over 40 per cent of India's fuel market and is the largest oil refiner has set 2046 as the target date for net-zero carbon emissions.""Our well-crafted blueprint, with a staggered investment plan of about Rs 2.4 lakh crore or USD 30 billion, will take us towards the net-zero destination,"" he said.These investments will be in producing green hydrogen to replace one currently used in refineries that come from fossil fuels, renewable energy capacity addition, biofuels, and carbon offsetting.Its energy transition plans also include an EV charging network and infrastructure to enable electric vehicles to swap chargeable batteries.While it navigates through the energy transition path, it is imperative that India strengthens its focus on the traditional fuel business, he said.""The Indian economy is surging ahead, aiming for the USD 5 trillion-mark by 2025. Reflecting India's robust economic growth, the latest outlook from the International Energy Agency has pegged India's energy demand to go up from the current 5 million barrels per day (mbpd) to 7 mbpd by 2030, and about 9 mbpd by 2040,"" he said.Meeting this demand would require more investment in pumping crude oil from below ground or importing it from abroad, turning it into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, and taking them to nook-and-corner of the country through a well-oiled distribution network.And the tumultuous geopolitical events that unfolded last year led to the rearrangement of the energy baskets of the developed economies, leaning towards conventional fuels. ""Let me assure you that to ensure India's energy security, we are strengthening the traditional energy avenues, as we shape the green energy vision,"" he said.""We are investing over Rs 1 lakh crore for expanding your company's refining capacity by about 33 per cent to reach almost 107 million tonnes per annum soon,"" he said.The expansion includes a new 9-million tonnes-per-annum oil refinery at Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu.Alongside, it is pursuing petrochemical integration, which will help convert crude into chemicals that are building blocks for a variety of products ranging from plastics to paints and cosmetics.""It can potentially offset business uncertainties and amplify the value of every hydrocarbon molecule,"" he said.IOC Board, he said, has accorded Stage-1 approval for the setting-up of Paradip petrochemical complex in Odisha at an estimated cost of over Rs 61,000 crore. This will be IOC's single largest investment at a location.The company is collaborating with Italy's Snam to explore the possibility of converting the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transportation.Vaidya said the company continues to expand its retail network and has acquired sites to develop wayside amenities (WSA) on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway.Also, the firm is expanding its offering of branded fuels. ""Our 100 Octane petrol XP100 is now being offered at over 200 retail outlets, 95 Octane petrol XP95 is available at over 10,300 outlets, and the green diesel XtraGreen is being retailed at more than 5,600 outlets,"" he said.In LPG, it has launched a unique QR code-based 'Track N Trace' pilot initiative.IndianOil is developing a 10 kilo tonnes per annum green hydrogen plant at Panipat Refinery, he said, adding the company is also setting up a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (or SAF) plant of 86.8 thousand tonnes per annum capacity at Panipat.To support sustainable growth, the firm also plans to convert over 100 million PET bottles annually into uniforms for its on-ground teams, non-combat uniforms for the armed forces, and other stakeholders."

The activist-short seller had in January accused the Gautam Adani-led conglomerate of accountancy fraud and stock manipulation, which led to its 10 listed entities losing Rs 12 lakh crore or $145 billion within a month of the report's release. Adani's stocks, however, started recovering in March after the US-based GQG bought stakes worth Rs 15,446 crore in the then-embattled business group.Since the Hindenburg episode, Adani group has taken strenuous steps to consolidate its financial position, say analysts. “The group has been striving to improve its credit profile consistently especially since its plan for a landmark fundraising was derailed earlier this year due to the Hindenburg debacle,” said Nirav Karkera, Head of Research, Fisdom.Balance sheets are now stronger and the ability to service debt appears to have improved significantly over the past couple of months. The group has been able to secure funds through a rather diverse consortium of industry participants including banks and capital markets.The group has been able to attract institutional capital with seemingly long-term strategic commitments which works in favour of the group's financial prowess while reaffirming credibility to a meaningful extent, Karkera explained.“One can expect the group to revisit expansionary plans and incidental fundraising agenda sooner than later,” he added.Some market participants also pointed out that total equity increasing to 55.77 percent of the total assets in FY23, from 40.16 percent at the end of FY19, hints at better sentiment for Adani group stocks. This is also a reflection of investor confidence returning, especially after the allegations faced by the group, they claimed."

In Q1 FY23, the Hindi film segment had recorded Rs 1,000 crore on the back of successful ventures including KGF 2, RRR and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, making it the best quarter for the Hindi box office so far.Now, the Hindi box office is estimated to grow 20 percent in Q2 FY24 versus the pre-Covid level towards Rs 1,200 crore, surpassing the June quarter of financial year 2023. This is due to the two Hindi franchise films, Gadar 2 starring Sunny Deol and Akshay Kumar-starrer OMG 2, reporting strong business of Rs 380 crore and Rs 110 crore net respectively so far. Both were released on August 11. Gadar 2 is expected to collect over Rs 450 crore in the coming weeks.Hindi hits""Given the sharp turnaround in Bollywood (Hindi films), industry-wide net box office collections (NBOC) stood at Rs 1,830 crore in the first two months of Q2 FY24. Industry-wide NBOC was at Rs 1,870 crore and Rs 1,860 crore in Q4 FY23 and Q1 FY24 respectively,"" said Jinesh Joshi, research analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher.He further said that upcoming releases like Dream Girl 2, Jawan and Salaar could add Rs 750 crore more to net box office collections taking the total revenue to Rs 2,580 crore in Q2 FY24.""Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Jawan is a tentpole movie and as of now, it looks like Jawan should have a spectacular opening. If Jawan sustains the euphoria, then this could further add fuel to the overall growth of footfalls,"" said Nitin Menon of NV Capital.Occupancy levels in multiplexes will move beyond the pre-Covid level average of 32 percent towards 34 to 36 percent in August 2023 due to Hindi content doing well, said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president, Elara Capital. ""Q2FY24 may report a big positive surprise on profitability led by higher occupancy.""Performance turnaroundExpectations for PVR Inox's profitability in the September quarter are high, riding on the robust box office performances, particularly of Hindi films, said Abhishek Jain, Head of Research, Arihant Capital. ""The company displayed promising signs by narrowing its losses in the June quarter of FY24. Vital for this quarter's outlook is the projected occupancies, anticipated to rise to over 30 percent from Q1's 22 percent. This shift signals a positive trend in audience engagement,"" he said.Shares of PVR Inox were trading at Rs 1,722.35, 0.83 percent higher at 14:14 on August 24 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).PVR Inox's dynamic ticket pricing has led to further improvement in the average ticket price (ATP) in Q2, said Taurani. Food and beverage (F&B) prices too have improved quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) due to premium English content and PVR Inox introducing non-vegetarian food items in Inox properties, he added.""In Q2 FY24, a 3 percent increase in the ATP is anticipated at Rs 253, rising from Rs 246 in Q1 FY24. F&B revenue is set to increase by 30 percent on a Q-o-Q basis,"" said Jain.Hollywood films have done well in Q2 FY24 which should result in significant benefit for PVR-Inox as it has a higher presence in metro and tier-I markets, said Joshi. ""Overall, we expect Q2 FY24 to register a sharp improvement in performance. The quarter had a strong start with movies like MI-7 and Oppenheimer doing well at the box office. Then came Gadar 2 and Jailer that stormed the BO. So far, six movies have breached the NBOC mark of Rs 100 crore in Q2.""The success of Gadar 2 has revived mass audience interest in cinemas, a positive trend that is visible in the recovery of the Hindi film business, said Jain. ""The coming months are expected to continue this momentum, potentially leading to a more complete recovery (of Hindi box office) by the end of FY24,"" he added.After the period from August 11 to 17 which will go down in film trade history as the golden week as the box office takings in that week were at an all-time high, the momentum is expected to continue for some more time, said film trade analyst Komal Nahta in a note.""August 25 is also expected to be strong for the box office as the advance booking of upcoming release Dream Girl 2 is impressive. With tickets for the Dream Girl sequel selling well, especially in the multiplexes, the film is expected to clock more than Rs 10 crore on the first day,"" he said.Taurani expects Dream Girl 2 to do a lifetime (total) business of Rs 70 crore. ""This is good given it is a medium-budget film, as these kinds of films have seen dismal collections in post-Covid times,"" he said."

One of the recommendations is the need to ""implement and build upon new government-led AI safety frameworks"".To make the many different aspects of AI governance work on an international level will require a multilateral framework that connects various national rules and ensures that an AI system certified as safe in one jurisdiction can also qualify as safe in another, according to Smith.There are many effective precedents for this, such as common safety standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, Smith said.""As the current holder of G20 Presidency and Chair of the Global Partnership on AI, India is well positioned to help advance a global discussion on AI issues,"" he said.Many nations will look to India's leadership and example on AI regulation, he asserted.""India's strategic position in the Quad and efforts to advance the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework present further opportunities to build awareness amongst major economies and drive support for responsible AI development and deployment within the Global South,"" he wrote.Working towards an internationally interoperable approach to responsible AI is critical to maximising the benefits of AI globally, Smith said.""Recognising that AI governance is a journey, not a destination, we look forward to supporting these efforts in the months and years to come,"" he said.The Microsoft honcho presented policy ideas and suggestions in the context of India, including need to implement and build upon new government-led AI safety frameworks.Among other takeaways from the five-point blueprint for the public governance of AI are ""effective safety brakes for AI systems that control critical infrastructure"", and developing ""a broader legal and regulatory framework based on the technology architecture for AI.""Smith also wrote about the need to promote transparency and ensure academic and public access to AI, and on new public-private partnerships to use AI as an effective tool to address the inevitable societal challenges that come with new technology.Earlier this year, the global population exceeded eight billion people, Smith said adding one out of every six people on earth today, live in India.India is experiencing a significant technological transformation that presents a tremendous opportunity to leverage innovation for economic growth.""This paper offers some of our ideas and suggestions as a company, placed in the Indian context,"" he said.While AI will benefit in daily tasks by helping people do things faster, easier, and better, its real potential is in its promise to unlock some of the world's most elusive problems, Smith said.""We've seen AI help save individuals' eyesight, make progress on new cures for cancer, generate new insights about proteins, and provide predictions to protect people from hazardous weather,"" he said expressing his optimism about the innovative solutions from India.That said, Smith noted it's not enough to focus only on the many opportunities to use AI to improve people's lives, as he drew attention to ""guardrails"" and ""proper control"".""We also believe that it is just as important to ensure proper control over AI as it is to pursue its benefits. We are committed and determined as a company to develop and deploy AI in a safe and responsible way,"" he said.The guardrails needed for AI require a broadly shared sense of responsibility and should not be left to technology companies alone."

Balaji said in an interview in Mumbai. “It’s a melange of opportunities. We are speaking to a host of them,” he said.The collaborations for the battery plant, capable of supplying cells for at least 500,000 vehicles a year, could range from a joint venture and sharing of knowledge to experimentation and licensing agreements, Balaji said.Tata intends to have partners across “the whole pathway from cell chemistry to manufacturing to industrialization,” he said. The conglomerate is speaking to several companies involved in different stages of the value chain  — research and development, manufacturing innovation and refining — and plans to make an announcement soon after narrowing down the options.Tata’s push adds to a host of carmakers like Mercedes-Benz Group Ag, Stellantis NV and Nissan Motor Co., who have mostly chosen to work with long-standing battery makers in scaling up Europe’s battery supply. Volkswagen AG, which is developing 240 gigawatt hours of capacity in the region, in June said its plans faced challenges from finding enough skilled workers, equipment and critical minerals.The factory is a win for the UK’s car industry that has been struggling in the aftermath of Brexit and the switch to electric vehicles. The UK produced 775,000 cars last year, the fewest since 1965, after the global semiconductor crunch and the closing of some factories hit output.Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Plc. and Tata Motors, which is a leader in India’s EV market, are anchor customers for the plant that will provide 40 gigawatt hours worth of batteries with supplies starting from 2026. JLR plans to invest £15 billion over the next five years in developing electric cars and autonomous-driving features.Tata plans to fund the project with a combination of equity and debt, Balaji said, adding it will also look at equipment financing. Tata will borrow whatever is required to keep the business plan running without over-leveraging the balance sheet, he said.Tata’s main demand from the UK was securing competitive cost and availability of green power on a continuous basis and negotiating that took time, Balaji said. The UK government adjusted taxes, including grid and connection charges, to make the power competitively priced."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/though-simpler-indias-data-privacy-law-is-stricter-than-gdpr-11213841.html,"Though simpler, India’s data privacy law is stricter than GDPR in some ways","August 18, 2023 08:21 PM IST","If a data breach or even a vulnerability occurs, the data fiduciary needs to inform not just the regulator but the concerned data principal. In comparison, in the EU, a data breach needs to be reported only to the regulator, and individuals only where the data fiduciary concludes that the breach compromises the rights and freedoms of the individual","The enactment of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act by Parliament recently marks a watershed moment in the way Indian businesses deal with personal data. Up to now, companies doing business outside India treaded the path of complying with foreign data privacy laws. Other Indian businesses mostly focused on having a privacy policy that was based on a boilerplate draft. This law is unique in the sense that it covers an area of law that largely did not exist in India till now.How do Indian businesses go about this? To understand the law, some basic terminology first. There are three key actors in data privacy – the data fiduciary, who collects the personal data or on whose behest it is collected, the data principal, whose data is being collected and the data processor, who processes the data on behalf of the data fiduciary.The first thing that a data fiduciary must do is to make a paradigm shift in its mindset towards dealing with personal data. Personal data needs to be dealt with carefully and managed through its entire life cycle of collection, storage and processing, and until it is finally deleted. This involves enabling systems that can manage personal data whether it relates to customers, service providers or employees or across different functions, whether relating to sales, HR or finance.Next, data fiduciaries must work out what personal data it needs and for what purpose and must document that in a privacy policy. The description of the personal data being collected and the purposes for which it is used should not be vague and general but should be as granular as possible. The data fiduciary has to communicate this to the data principal in the form of a notice.GDPR InfluenceThe business should in most cases obtain consent from the data principal to use the personal data and for the purpose mentioned in the notice. This consent must be “freely given”, “specific”, “informed”, “unconditional”, and an “unambiguous indication of consent” and through a “clear affirmative action”. This language is mostly borrowed from the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. The EU has developed substantial jurisprudence on what this means. For example, purposes must be mentioned with some granularity and generally, each purpose must be consented to separately. Further, where the user has no choice but to consent, especially for a purpose that is not necessary for the specific function for which the personal data is collected, this may not amount to free consent.The law does allow other grounds for processing of personal data, that is, without obtaining consent, but they are fairly limited. One can process personal data when required to comply with a law or a court order. For example, a listed company need not obtain consent from a shareholder in order to collect personal data of a shareholder where such processing is in order to fulfil Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Know Your Client (KYC) requirements.Gaps In DraftingOne can process personal data when provided voluntarily by a data principal if the data principal does not object to its use. The provision is not well drafted and not easy to understand. It appears to apply when the personal data is given on the initiative of the data principal or when it is given automatically, such as when a data principal goes to a pharmacy and provides her personal information in the course of purchasing medicine.Under the new law, data principals can not only ask what personal data of theirs is being stored by the data fiduciary but have a right to ask for it to be corrected or updated. Further, an individual can also ask for personal data to be deleted when the purpose for which it was collected has been served. In addition, the data fiduciary would have to delete the data on its own once the purpose for collecting such personal data has been served. This would require a periodic review of the personal data being stored to determine whether the personal data is still required or to build automated processes to delete personal data.Accordingly, there is a need to be extremely strict and disciplined when dealing with personal data. It must be stored in well-structured systems that ensure its proper management. In this regard, the law does give sanctity to the concept of a consent manager – a third party which will manage the consent process. These rights do not apply in some situations, especially when consent is not required.The requirement of deletion could have a profound impact on big data where the data is not anonymised. Data-based decisions must be made after ensuring completeness, accuracy and consistency of the data. A key right in the EU, not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing has not been provided in this law. While the law requires that personal data be used only for purposes that are specified in the notice, the law is somewhat unclear about imposing a reasonableness or legitimacy standard for those purposes. Overall, the law appears to be reasonably friendly towards AI and big data.A data fiduciary also has an obligation to apply reasonable security standards for safeguarding the personal data that it collects and processes. If it does not do so, it could face consequences under the law. The maximum penalty that can be imposed is Rs 250 crore! Further, if a data breach or even a vulnerability occurs, the data fiduciary needs to inform not just the regulator but the concerned data principal. A data fiduciary needs to be mindful of the reputational risk associated with being publicly known as having been the subject of a data breach.Stricter Than GDPRIf you think this is all a tough ask, you should know that the law is simpler and less prescriptive than data privacy laws in many countries. This kind of simpler law is appropriate for a country like India for two reasons – one, because India is just starting down the road of data privacy compliance and two – because India has a huge SME sector that would struggle to comply with a more complex law.At the same time, the law is stricter than GDPR in some ways; for example, in the EU, a business that can develop a case for it having a “legitimate interest” to process personal data can do so without consent. This is largely not possible in India. Further, in the EU, a data breach needs to be reported only to the regulator and individuals only where the data fiduciary concludes that the breach could result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the individual.The government has given itself the power to exempt classes of data fiduciaries from provisions of the law. This includes start-ups, which have been specifically mentioned. The definition of who constitutes a start-up will be notified separately. The government has announced that it intends to bring the law into force within 10 months. It is hoped that it would notify as soon as possible when the substantive provisions will come into force so industry has time to prepare with a target date in mind. It’s now time for every Indian business to begin that journey towards compliance with data privacy regulation.Stephen Mathias is a partner, Technology Law Practice at Kochhar & Co.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/demand-for-electric-two-wheelers-slowing-down-due-to-reduced-govt-subsidy-report-11214361.html,Demand for electric two wheelers slowing down due to reduced govt subsidy: Report,"August 18, 2023 10:16 AM IST","The medium term sales trajectory for two wheelers, which include e-two wheelers as well, is anticipated to be modest, characterised by uncertainties and driven by a host of factors, it said.","The reduction in FAME subsidy is slowing down demand for electric two wheelers and the manufacturers will now have to focus on achieving price reduction through R&D and innovation, a report said on Thursday.The medium term sales trajectory for two wheelers, which include e-two wheelers as well, is anticipated to be modest, characterised by uncertainties and driven by a host of factors, it said.In its report, CARE Ratings said the core segments of two wheelers, specifically the 75 cc - 110 cc range in motorcycles and the 75 cc - 125 cc range in scooters, have shown a sharp sales volume decline from FY19 to FY22, with a slight recovery seen in FY23.Sales of electric two wheelers also significantly declined in Q1 FY24 due to the government withholding FAME subsidies for certain Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), it said.Additionally, the report said that a subsidy reduction to Rs 10,000 per kWh from Rs 15,000 per kWh and 15 per cent of the ex-factory price from 40 per cent earlier, adds to the uncertainty in two wheeler sales.""Manufacturers of electric two wheelers will now have to focus on achieving price reduction through R&D and innovation, rather than on government subsidies,"" it said.In April 2015, the central government rolled out the FAME subsidy scheme to boost the sales of EVs with a budget of Rs 75 crore.The scheme entailed cash subsidy being credited to dealers of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to bring down the acquisition cost for vehicle buyers. The budgetary allocation was subsequently increased on an annual basis along with the extension of the scheme, till FY19 when the budget stood at Rs 145 crore.From April 2020, it was replaced by the FAME II scheme, which entailed a massive increase in budget to Rs 10,000 crore and was initially applicable for three years till March 31, 2022. The same was extended in June 2021 for another two years till March 31, 2024.In June 2021, the government hiked the subsidy on EVs to Rs 15,000/kwh from Rs 10,000/kwh with the maximum cap increased to 40 per cent from 20 per cent of the ex-factory price of the vehicle.Apart from the subsidies available under the FAME scheme, various state governments also introduced their own incentives such as a subsidy amount per Kwh of battery capacity, and discounts or complete exemption on payment of road tax.Considering that the subsidy of up to Rs 60,000 could be claimed under FAME II from the central government in addition to the state subsidies and incentives, the on-road price of electric two wheelers declined to a level where it was comparable with the price of petrol two-wheelers, CARE Ratings said.As a result, demand surged in FY22 and FY23, it said.However, the government reduced the subsidy amount to Rs 10,000/kWh with a cap of up to 20 per cent of the ex-factory price, effective June 1 this year.This action has had an immediate impact on electric two wheeler sales as was witnessed in the current year's volumes, the ratings agency said.Initially, CARE Ratings said it anticipated that growth in the two wheeler segment would be driven by electric vehicles, albeit from a smaller base compared to Internal Combustion Engine-based vehicles.However, the reduction in FAME subsidy effective from June 1, 2023 has curtailed the previous robust growth in this category, it noted.""Over the long-term, technological developments leading to a reduction in battery costs which makes electric two wheelers comparable in price with ICE vehicles (after disregarding subsidies for EVs) would be the key factor driving electric two wheeler sales,"" Sudarshan Shreenivas, Director at CARE Ratings, said.According to him, if the government is successful in the implementation of interoperability standards for EV batteries,it would definitely lead to a spurt in e-two wheeler sales given the convenience of switching spent batteries with fully charged batteries at charging stations."

In a world where economic powerhouses are shifting, India's role is poised to become increasingly significant","In a world of uncertainty, where the global economic landscape is evolving rapidly India shines as a beacon of stability and growth. With its sheer size of market, robust technological strengths, impressive GDP growth, large middle class, surging consumerism and stable government, India presents a compelling case for investors looking to capitalise on long-term growth prospects.Here are seven reasons why I feel the next decade belongs to India. Market SizeIndia boasts a population of over 1.4 billion, making it the most populous country in the world. This sheer size translates into an expansive consumer base and an attractive market for various industries. The demographic dividend – a young population – further adds to India's growth potential. With a median age of around 29 years, India is set to enjoy a substantial workforce, fostering innovation and driving economic growth. Technological StrengthsIndia's prowess in the technology sector is undeniable. The country has emerged as a global technology hub, with an ever growing software industry. That, along with the exponential growth of Indian startups across sectors showcases the entrepreneurial spirit that is spreading its roots not only in large cities, but also across smaller cities. In fact, with over 50,000 startups, India's startup ecosystem is the third-largest in the world attracting billions of dollars of FDI every year. Startups are thriving across the country, leveraging technology to address unique problems and create disruptive solutions. GDP GrowthIndia's GDP growth has been consistent and robust over the years. Despite global economic fluctuations, the Indian economy has demonstrated resilience, maintaining an average growth rate of around 7 percent. This sustained growth trajectory is projected to continue, driven by domestic consumption, investment, and a growing technology sector. According to projections, India is expected to become the third-largest economy by 2027, with a GDP surpassing $5 trillion. Rising Middle ClassThe burgeoning middle class in India is a compelling driver of economic growth. As millions transition from low-income to middle-income households, their consumption patterns are transforming the country's economy. The per capita income of India is set to double  from the current $2,000 to $4,000 in 2028. By 2030, it is estimated that India's middle class will number over 700 million people. This demographic shift translates to increased purchasing power, greater consumption, and heightened demand for quality products, brands and services across various industries. Growing Defence BudgetWith global geopolitical dynamics evolving, India has been steadily increasing its defence budget to modernise its armed forces with an aim to become self-reliant in defence manufacturing.  India is among the top five largest military spenders globally and by 2025, India's defence budget is projected to exceed $70 billion. This growing budget not only supports the country's defence needs but also provides opportunities for investment in defence technology and innovation. Make in IndiaSince its launch in 2014, India's ""Make in India"" initiative has catalysed diverse sectors. Global car manufacturers like Hyundai and Suzuki have ramped up the production units thereby increasing India's automotive output. Companies like  Samsung and Apple have set up local manufacturing for their mobile phone business hence reducing the dependence on imports significantly. Various other industries such as pharma, renewable energy and defence have seen significant gains due to the local manufacturing push. In the last nine years, over $100 billion of FDI has come in, in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing will be one of the largest job creating sectors in the years to come. Stable GovernmentPolitical stability is a cornerstone of economic growth. India's democratic setup and relatively stable governance provide a conducive environment for foreign investments and domestic economic development. Recent economic reforms, such as “Digital India” and the ""Make in India"" initiative, showcase the government's commitment to streamlining business operations and attracting investment. India's push for infrastructure development is a pivotal factor in its bullish outlook. The expansion of transportation networks – road, air and rail, across the country is not only fostering economic growth but also improving the quality of life for citizens.As we traverse the next decade, India's progress promises a host of opportunities for investors and businesses seeking to be part of a dynamic growth story.  In a world where economic powerhouses are shifting, India's role is poised to become increasingly significant. As we navigate the uncertainties of the global landscape, embracing a bullish perspective on India is not just a rational choice; it is an acknowledgment of the remarkable strides the nation has already taken and the immense promise it holds for the years ahead.Ankit Nagori is founder and CEO of Curefoods, and also an angel investor.

That’s a marked shift in approach from July, when Bloomberg News reported JSW was interested in up to 20% of Teck’s coal business.A deal could value the coal business at more than $8 billion and JSW has been sounding out banks about financing for a potential offer, according to the people. Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty an agreement will be reached, they said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information.Representatives for JSW and Teck declined to comment.Any JSW consortium could yet face competition for the coal asset from Glencore, which in June proposed buying the business for about $8 billion as an alternative to a full takeover of Vancouver-based Teck.Around that time, Teck said it had received a number of indications of interest in its coal operations, without naming the parties. Japan’s Nippon Steel Corp. had agreed to take a stake in a spun-off Elk Valley Resources in February before Teck dropped the plan to split its coal and metals businesses after failing to muster shareholder support.Led by Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Price, Teck remains under pressure to design a plan that can trump both its unsuccessful split proposal and a potential full takeover by Glencore.Earlier this month, Glencore underlined its continued interest in a deal with Teck by holding back $2 billion for a potential purchase of the Canadian miner’s coal business — cash it would otherwise have returned to shareholders. For Glencore, a deal would present a way to exit the hugely profitable but polluting thermal coal business by combining it in a new company with Teck’s steelmaking coal operations."

""Even during the Covid years, we were investing in technology and building interesting use cases for the customers."" MakeMyTrip's core competence is travel and teaming up with Amazon Web Services (AWS) helps it to keep sharp focus on operations and innovation, as technology allows on-demand infra scale up and cost benefits, according to Mohan.Excerpts from the interview: Q: What are some of the key milestones for MakeMyTrip, and the growth drivers for you in the Indian travel and tourism industry? A: MakeMyTrip was built on a bet on the digital medium, and has been at the forefront of digital commerce for almost two decades now.Over the last few years, we have also become more of a travel super-app, covering the entire gamut of products and offerings that one could possibly think of when you think of travel. Also, over the last few years, we have expanded beyond our usual B2C space, and have become a travel platform, offering travel products to channels outside of our popular, consumer-facing, travel super-app.MyBiz is our corporate travel offering, available to corporates to enable their employees to purchase travel products online. It uses the familiar, customer-friendly interface that MakeMyTrip offers.MyPartner is a platform for travel agents who now have the entire repertoire of MakeMyTrip's travel products that they can sell to their customers' for the segment of consumers that find it more convenient to book tickets through their friendly, neighbourhood travel-agent.TripMoney is a travel fintech initiative encompassing travel insurance, travel-loans, EMI solutions, and foreign exchange solutions. MyAffiliate is a B2B2C API (application programming interface) capability through which our affiliates such as Amazon Pay, GPay, PhonePe, HDFC, etc offer our travel products on their sites.Parallelly, we also launched our site in Arabic in Dubai to build our international footprint in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council), the Gulf countries.Q: How has travel made a comeback post-Covid and what broad trends do you see in the market? A: Let me give you some indicative numbers. Daily passenger data, that is how many passengers are flying in a day, has been hitting record numbers lately. According to media reports, over 4.5 lakh passengers are flying on a given day all over India.This is almost a growth of an estimated 51 per cent year-over-year.So yes, travel is back with a vengeance and numbers are actually validating that.Internally too, we are noting a trend towards more immersive and relaxed travel itineraries. For example, average room nights per booking is on an upward trend, which means that people want relaxed vacations or leisure travel with their families.Nearby destinations are becoming more popular, and we are experiencing greater demand for homestays and family stays, for instance.Q: What is the size and scale of your operations, in terms of number of customers and other key business metrics, and what are your growth rates? A: We have a total transacted customer base of over 60 million. To give you a sense of scale, we provide accommodation options in over 2,000 cities in India alone. Three out of ten domestic flyers book their tickets on the MakeMyTrip platform.Our platform lists 5,600-plus holiday packages through a broad omnichannel strategy. myBiz is already the Largest Travel Management Company in the B2B space, and growing very rapidly.A significant percentage of travel agents across the country source travel services for their customers from myPartner. We entered the GCC market during the pandemic but have already become the leading OTA in the market in the flights segment within two short years.Q: What are the technology and digital pillars that support your operations? A: We continue to invest in technology at a steady pace. Even during the Covid years, we were steadily investing in technology and building interesting use cases for the customers.From an engineering perspective, our focus is on two aspects. First, on building robust horizontal platforms, on top of which we build all of our new offerings like myBiz, myPartner, and myAffiliate.Second, our focus is on leveraging the vast corpus of travel-intent data for all of India. We use data analytics and AI to gain insights into customer behaviour and preferences. This enables us to offer customised, personalised recommendations and experiences to each customer.Q: Can you describe the solution and workloads you are running on Amazon Web Services (AWS)? A: All of our businesses are on AWS right now. Everything that we do both outward and inward facing, all of it is on AWS and has been so for quite a few years. AWS allows us to leverage cutting edge computing capabilities and allows us to run new experiments, without worrying about infra provisioning.AWS cloud also helps us on the availability, reliability and performance because obviously when you are a cloud and you can horizontally scale, you are doing much better on availability, and offer a much more responsive and delightful experience for the customer.Q: In terms of business outcomes, what benefits have you experienced as a result of running on AWS? A: The biggest advantage is agility. We can bring new offerings to the market at a fast pace. Obviously, the underlying tech platform helps, but even having infinite pool of infrastructure available on-demand...if we have to offer new service to a new segment, new country, the infra is ready and available for us to launch.The shared responsibility model of security also helps. Plus the variable pricing - you pay what you use - is a big advantage too.Leveraging AWS provides us with the obvious benefit of being able to abstract away the infrastructure maintenance and management and focus on core competencies. Secondly, our unique relationship with AWS keeps us at the very forefront of innovations in the technology and the computing world.In this dynamic ecosystem we can rely on AWS to provide us with resilient innovations to aid us in staying ahead of the curve. Frankly, I really believe that has greatly helped us retain the market leader position and will continue to do so in the years to come."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/corporate-failure-is-a-valuable-asset-thats-hard-to-protect-11203281.html,Corporate failure is a valuable asset that’s hard to protect,"August 16, 2023 04:53 PM IST",How do you value and protect know-how about unsuccessful products and experiments at a time of heightened employee mobility? It’s an increasingly important question for investors to consider,"The fraction of enterprise value of large US companies represented by tangible assets — things like real estate and inventory — has fallen from 50 percent to 20 percent over the past 15 years. Moreover, only about 25 percent of enterprise value is in identifiable intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, customer lists and data files. The remaining 55 percent is in assets too intangible to even identify clearly — things like technical knowledge, corporate culture, going-concern value and customer relationships.A recent article in Business Law Today calls attention to something less tangible still — the economics of negative information assets. How do you assess and safeguard corporate know-how about products that didn’t work, dead-end research or failed experiments at a time of heightened staff mobility?For companies with little in the way of tangible assets or recurring revenue — ones valued primarily on expected future products and services — gauging the worth of what a company knows is key, and much of that knowledge is about approaches that don’t work. Moreover, that knowledge only has value if the company can protect it.Just as normal matter exists in a sea of dark matter and dark energy that make up 95 percent of the universe, positive business information (such as product specifications) exists in a much larger sea of negative information (such as ideas that don’t work). Advertisers work to create brand names — positive information assets — but also to warn against an innumerable list of dangers from head (dandruff) to toe (athlete’s foot), or make “where’s the beef” criticism of competitors’ products. Such negative information assets increase the value of a product by making the alternative seem worse. Employee handbooks list a few positive admonitions, and much longer lists of what not to do.Not only are intangible assets — especially negative information assets — growing rapidly in economic value, they are also getting harder to protect. Employee mobility has grown since 2008, especially in technology fields; and the government is working to increase it further with Federal Trade Commission efforts to ban non-compete clauses and the proposedWorkforce Mobility Act of 2023. Courts are getting more reluctant to grant patents and other intellectual protection, especially on software. Work-from-home means information spills out to uncontrolled locations, and of course the Internet makes transmitting information far easier than in the past.From an investors’ perspective, this means that only about 20 percent of what you pay for an average stock covers assets that can be easily insured and protected against theft or damage; and that creditors can seize and sell in a bankruptcy with some hope of recovery. Stock investors are hoping for future cash flows to be generated mostly by intangible assets, in many cases assets that cannot even be identified clearly and may be negative. Creditors can look to only a small portion of enterprise value to secure loans.At least with positive information there is some hope of tracking down theft and suing for recovery. If an employee goes to a competitor who soon launches a product similar to yours, you will notice. You can demonstrate the similarities in court, and perhaps refer to patent or other protection.But what if an employee goes to a competitor and designs a different product from yours, and the research effort is sped up because your former employee learned on your dime what dead ends to avoid? What will you point to in court to prove the theft? What kind of patents protect failed ideas?Most of my professional experience is in finance. A hedge fund employee who copies her former employer’s strategy can be identified. But behind every implemented strategy are hundreds or thousands of alternatives that were tested and rejected. An employee who knows those results can find a good new strategy much faster than a researcher starting from scratch.One prominent example of this is the high-profile lawsuit by Alphabet Inc’s Waymo alleging that its former engineer Anthony Levandowski took to Uber Technologies Inc. information about dead-end designs and approaches unsuited to market that saved Uber substantial time and money, and were critical to its efforts to develop self-driving cars.Moving from an investor’s to a social perspective, intellectual protection and trade secret law attempts to balance the social good of encouraging research and development, with the other social good of competition. Patents force applicants to reveal their secrets in return for 20 years of protection. Companies are allowed to take some measures to protect trade secrets, but not to prevent former employees from making a living in their fields.Negative information does not fit into either model. You can’t force former employees to remake mistakes they identified while working for you. You can’t get a patent on a failed idea, one that forces other people to pay you money to avoid the failure. From a social standpoint these don’t balance any considerations, they just impose perverse costs.There is a related issue in academic research — it’s rare to publish negative results. A vast amount of negative information knowledge is systematically excluded from the literature in many fields.If the trend toward increasing negative information asset value and decreasing ability to protect it continues, it should lead to fragmentation in research. If every company pursues one idea and liquidates if its idea fails, negative information becomes public, and no entity has to protect it. Negative information assets are a problem only for large companies that survive the failure of many research paths, and thereby accumulate large negative information assets that cannot be insured or protected.One solution for a large company is to put researchers in siloes, so individual employees have knowledge of at most one dead-end. But this eliminates valuable cross-fertilisation of research and gets in the way of rational employee development. Many hedge funds do this, but it is a problematic solution in fields like information and medical technology where the scientific culture is more open, and there is more communication between academic and for-profit activities and more diverse specialists are needed for projects.I don’t know how this will play out, but I think it represents one of the biggest challenges to big tech company valuations. With increasing employee mobility and weakening non-compete protections, big tech is losing the ability to protect its fastest-growing type of asset. I can’t see any good solution — either in research strategy or law — but it’s something investors should consider seriously.Aaron Brown is a former managing director and head of financial market research at AQR Capital Management.Credit: Bloomberg"
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/travel/visa-delays-and-rejections-restrict-full-recovery-in-travel-services-for-thomas-cook-11201621.html,"Visa delays, rejections restrict full recovery in travel services for Thomas Cook","August 18, 2023 01:33 PM IST",The online travel aggregator said that there is gradual improvement in the visa situation for Indian travellers and things will get normal by end of December 2023,"Online travel aggregator Thomas Cook recorded its best-ever quarter in the April-May-June period of the financial year 2024 with full recovery in most of its business.However, one segment — the travel services — managed to reach 77 percent of the pre-pandemic level. The company attributed the delay in recovery in the segment to visa delays.The company's travel services segment comprises leisure and corporate travel along with destination management services (DMS) in India and globally. Its India travel segment has been affected due to visa delays and rejections.Visa issues""While the world has opened up, visas are still not easy to get. So, we can't offer package deals to those, who don't have visas with them. Schengen visa is not easy to get and the rejection rate is as high as 18 percent, which used to be 2-3 percent in pre-Covid days. We have had several cases in the past couple of months when visas were rejected due to which travel plans got cancelled,"" Debasis Nandy, President & Group Chief Financial Officer, Thomas Cook (India) told Moneycontrol.He said that in the case of families even if the visa of one person is rejected the travel plan for the entire family gets cancelled. ""This has severely affected the number of tourists we can send overseas. Also, airfares continue to be high. For an average traveller, it gets expensive as a round trip ticket to Europe in 2019 that was costing Rs 65,000, today costs Rs 85,000. This is a 60 percent increase in prices and because of this we see some reluctance for foreign travel.""The company still managed large travel groups and about 18,000 customers travelled to Europe via Thomas Cook and its subsidiary SOTC. It expects the number to reach about 25,000 customers by the end of the year. In addition, for the Cherry Blossoms tour that it launched, it reported close to about 2,000 customers that had booked the tour.There is gradual improvement in the visa situation for Indian travellers, Nandy said. ""The visas scenario as compared to the last six months is a lot better today. We expect things will get normalised by the end of December 2023. This segment (travel services - India) will be back to 2019 levels by the last quarter of FY24.""The company's international holiday volume recovered about 50 percent to the pre‐pandemic level in the June quarter of FY24 while its domestic holiday business reported a 72 percent recovery.Go First impactThe recovery in domestic holiday business was subdued after May when Go Airways announced the withdrawal of its flights on May 3 this year that dented the demand on the domestic side because the airlines connected to some of the ports that used to be in the top five destinations that the company sold on the domestic side, Thomas Cook's management said in Q1 FY24 earnings call.The travel operator registered a lot of cancellations and 35 percent of cancellations came in because customers did not want to travel by paying a higher price as airfares had gone up after Go First halted operations.Nandy said that for Go First a lot will depend on how they get back consumer confidence whenever they resume operations. India’s aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has conditionally allowed Go First to resume operations after carrying out a multi-location audit in July.""They will have to do certain things to build consumer confidence. It is also the question of when will they refund the money of all (travellers and travel agents) whose flights were cancelled when they (Go First) halted their operations. It will not be easy given the way they abruptly stopped operations. However, if they do come back we will certainly see a more balanced airfare at least on the domestic front because today Indigo runs 60 percent market share and it is becoming more like a monopoly. Getting additional flights will be beneficial and Go First's revival will be good for consumers as well as travel companies,"" he said.Foreign tourist arrivalsWhile domestic and international holidays by Indian travellers have been affected, foreign tourists coming to India or the inbound business for Thomas Cook have seen a full recovery. ""There have been a 104 percent recovery versus pre-pandemic level,"" Nandy said.He added that on an industry level, volumes for the foreign tourist business started reviving in January to March period and the volumes reached 50 percent of the pre-Covid level. ""April to September is a dry period. So, in the second half of FY24, we expect bookings to pick up.""G20 boosts businessIndia hosting the G20 summit this year boosted Thomas Cook's Meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions tourism (MICE) business. ""This year has been great for MICE travel. We are one of the three parties who have assisted the government for the G20 event and the additional business from that has been Rs 125-130 crore this year,"" Nandy said.The MICE travel segment reported a 105 percent recovery versus the pre-pandemic level.""The G20 Summit has been planned in a way that meetings took place in all major tourist destinations of India and not just in select metro cities. Because of this more interest will be generated for these destinations. Tourism contributes 10 percent to our (India's) GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and the government is trying to make sure it grows.""Thomas Cook reported Rs 91.4 crore in consolidated operating profits in the June quarter of FY24 as against Rs 3.3 crore in Q1 FY23. It said that the strong order book is signalling robust business for the September quarter in FY24."

The chain has cited quality issues in explaining the shortfall.The burger chain, one of India's biggest with nearly 400 outlets, joins many McDonald's and Subway stores that have removed tomatoes from menus as India's food inflation this week hit its highest since January 2020.The U.S. sandwich chain even cancelled the free cheese slices it offered for years.Rival Domino's, meanwhile, has tried bringing down prices to appeal to struggling consumers with a $0.60 pizza - its cheapest in the world.The tomato supply crisis has coincided with a surge in prices by as much as 450% to record highs as monsoon rains disrupted crop and supply chains - although they have since eased.""Why are there no tomatoes in my burgers?"" reads a question on the support page of Burger King India's web site. The answer states its Indian franchisee follows ""very high standards of quality"" and tomatoes will be back soon.""We request your patience and understanding,"" it says.Restaurant Brands Asia, which operates Burger King in India, did not respond to requests for comment.The pain is spreading with July retail inflation data released this week showing prices of vegetables rose 37% over a year.

While construction of coal handling plants (CHPs)/silos is pegged at Rs 2,174 crore, procurement of HEMM would take up Rs 1,965 crore in FY24.

India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has sought to build closer ties to the US and make itself a manufacturing hub.Before the iPhone 14, Apple had only a sliver of its iPhone assembly in India, which lagged China output by six to nine months. That delay was drastically reduced last year, and Apple produced 7% of its iPhones in India at the end of March.The goal this year is to move closer to parity on shipment timing from India and China, though suppliers are not yet certain they will achieve it, the people said, asking not to be named as the information is not public.The scale of India production for the iPhone 15 will depend on the ready availability of components, which are largely imported, and the smooth ramp-up of production lines at the Foxconn factory outside Chennai.The new iPhone, likely to be announced on Sept. 12, promises to be the biggest update to the device in three years. It will include major upgrades to the camera system across the range, and the Pro models will gain an improved 3-nanometer A16 processor.The new family of handsets is critical to reviving flagging sales. Apple this month reported its third straight quarter of declining sales, weighed down by tepid consumer demand in key markets like the US, China and Europe.Other Apple suppliers in India — Pegatron Corp. and a Wistron Corp. factory that is being acquired by the Tata Group — will also soon assemble the iPhone 15, the people said.An Apple spokeswoman and representatives of Wistron and Pegatron declined to comment. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.Apple has steadily expanded in India through its Taiwanese suppliers, benefiting from some of the Modi administration’s financial incentives to bring in more high-end manufacturing. That’s helped Apple triple iPhone production to more than $7 billion in India in the fiscal year that ended in March, Bloomberg News reported previously.Apple, which opened its first retail stores in the country in April, now views the fast-growing India market as both a retail opportunity and an important production base for its gadgets in the longer term. In the quarter through June, iPhone sales in India grew double-digits to a new high, though Apple hasn’t disclosed precise numbers.Apple is “committed to growing and investing across the country,” Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said after meeting Modi on his India trip in April."

Recently US investment firm GQG Partners picked a 6.8 per cent stake in the company and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) another 2.8 per cent.AGEL has a clear sight of how it will fund the renewable capacity addition, they said without giving details.The capacity AGEL is building is about 10 per cent of the renewable energy capacity that India is targeting by 2030 in the transition towards achieving a net zero carbon emission target by 2070.Besides AGEL, other industry leaders like Tata Power, ReNew Power and Acme Solar and state-owned NTPC, has announced big plans to transition to green energy.At the time of investing in the company, GQG's Rajiv Jain had stated that Adanis are efficient. ""For example, they get paid in 60 days versus 260 days for a competitor. Given their efficiencies, it is our view that the company will generate higher returns.""In terms of revenue visibility, there is a 25-year fixed-tariff power purchase agreement (PPA) with an average portfolio tariff of Rs 3.02 per unit, sources said.Despite concern over AGEL's valuation - which is 32 times its book even after correction - analysts believe the company's equity will be continuously recycled, as the cash flow generated each year will serve as an equity contribution for the next project. As a result, the return on equity is expected to keep expanding.Green energy, which is derived from natural sources like wind and sunlight, is abundant in nature and does not release greenhouse gases. AGEL is tapping into this source of energy abundantly available in states like Rajasthan and Gujarat.Rajasthan is becoming one of the nation's most vital solar energy centres. A transmission corridor is taking shape in its western part with 1.25 lakh hectares of government land being available for setting up solar plants.AGEL is one of the largest investors in Rajasthan's energy sector. Adani Renewable Energy Park Rajasthan Ltd (AREPRL) - a joint venture of AGEL and the state government's nodal agency for developing non-conventional energy sources RRECL, is developing solar parks with a cumulative capacity of 10,000 MW in a phased manner.To develop wind projects, the company evaluates regions with wind resource potential across the country. It has installed many wind masts in resource-rich areas like Mundra in Gujarat and Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, they said.AGEL's wind power plants have an operational capacity of 1,201 MW.Wind and solar energy have variable supply, posing a challenge to large-scale adoption of renewables. Hybridization of wind and solar reduces this variability due to the complementary nature of their generation profile solar generation is higher during the day, while wind generation can be higher at night.Hybrid projects have higher capacity utilization and enjoy the benefit of a reduction in costs associated with sharing transmission lines.AGEL's solar-wind hybrid projects have an operational capacity of 2,140 MW, sources said.As per a study, the per-capita emission in India is 1.8 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Compared to the United States (14.7) and China (7.6), it is very less. Still, India stands at the third position globally.Projects like ones taken up by AGEL is helping the nation reduce its carbon footprint.AGEL's renewable projects generated 14.8 million MWh in FY23, leading to a reduction of 13.5 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to the emissions of 8.9 million cars, sources said, adding the company has been ranked first in Asia and among the 'Top 10 RE companies globally' by ISS-ESG in its ESG assessment.AGEL is already the largest solar developer in the world and on its way to becoming the largest renewable company in India and among the most formidable renewable energy players in the world."

This used to be below 25 per cent two years before,"" Shah told PTI.When asked if Bata had extended the benefits to consumers, as inflation has moderated, Shah said, ""There were price points we had vacated in the past because of cost pressures but now with the easing of inflation, we are entering some of those with fresher offerings as they had worked well for us.""""At the same time, there are consumers who are looking at superior product offerings which we continue to build our portfolio on,"" he said.Besides, it has staved off from any further price hike for the last 8-9 months.""That has served us well in several areas and categories. Whatever growth which we have seen in Q1 is largely a volume-driven growth,"" he said adding ""That should also eventually stabilise and provide value to consumers as time goes by.""When asked whether Bata would increase its spending on A&P as margins are improving, Shah replied:"" Absolutely! We will do it very consciously and aggressively and we will also make sure that we are now more and more pivoting... We will pivot even more aggressively towards younger audiences through our digital-first marketing strategy.""Bata would continue its thrust on online sales and e-commerce, a segment in which it was a late entrant. As part of its expansion plans, it is stressing both brick & mortar channels and online channels.""We have the fastest growth from our e-commerce channels from last three years and we see no difference this year and it will keep growing,"" said Shah adding "" Right now it is 10-12 per cent of our turnover and in the next 2-3 years, we would like to see that to grow to 18 to 20 per cent."" However, he also added Bata would continue its investment in stores and offline expansion.""While we will expand our company-owned stores, we will have a significant part of expansion coming through two large revenue channels - franchise business, which has been expanding and adding stores at a rapid pace over the last six quarters and that continues and through multi-brand outlet distribution channels,"" he said.When asked about the rural market, Shah said that he does not see any signs of any structural problems at those places.Terming the inflation a ""short-term blip"", he said consumers have seen significant inflation over the last two years and it would take some time to absorb it and soon it would be normal like earlier.""The medium-term outlook, we are pretty optimistic about our own growth plans and for the industry also. We are pressing ahead all our levers of thrust in terms of our strategy of going ahead,"" said Shah.Bata is also scaling its presence at MBO distribution channels. It has access to 1,500 towns only through this MBO channel and the pace will continue.""We have significant headroom to grow - both offline and online. We will see growth happening at both channels,"" said Shah.Over the consumption, Shah said from the last 3-4 quarters, when Covid is behind, formal offering, as well as dress occasions, has gone up significantly for Bata. It has bounced back very smartly.However, he added:"" In the longer term, it will be casualization of the market and that trend, we are pursuing. While we are benefitting from bounce back of formals as well as school etc, we do see casualization as a long-term trend,"" Bata has introduced casuals under its Hus Puppies and Red Label, which is having a good presence.It also has plans to expand its shoe insurance scheme after having initial success.The company had added 125 franchises last year and also a few CoCo (company owned, company operated) stores and this fiscal, it will be equal in numbers, he added.Currently, the top 30 cities contribute 40 per cent of Bata India's revenue, while the rest comes from tier II & III markets and below.Over the government's move to fix its own standard size and measurements for apparel and shoes, Shah said it is a welcome step.""It's a very early stage. Consultation is going on and we are actively engaged in the process.... being a leader, we will actively participate in the formulation of standards, especially leveraging our knowledge and understanding of the Indian consumer, which we have accumulated after so many decades"" he added."

It gives a natural hedge if we have marketing margins,"" Varma said.MRPL's exports, previously 2-3 cargoes each of diesel and jet fuel monthly, have suffered in the last six months as maintenance shutdowns at other refiners raised demand for its fuel.""Our plan is to go for zero exports as we would like to push volumes through our retail outlets,"" Varma said.In the current fiscal year to March 31, MRPL aims to operate its refinery at about 107-108% capacity, down from 115% a year ago, with plans for a 35-40 day maintenance outage of a 60,000 bpd crude unit and secondary units from late August.MRPL would cut crude imports from countries including Russia in August and September because of the outage, Varma said.""We don't want to carry a higher crude inventory level,"" he said, adding that MRPL did not plan to enter into a term contract for Russian oil as spot prices offered ""more flexibility"" to secure cheaper supplies.MRPL in 2016 announced a plan to expand its refinery's capacity to 360,000 bpd.

Its operating profit missed estimates. It earlier posted a 14% decline in revenue for the period, its first drop since the final three months of 2021.Hon Hai’s results underscore expectations of a worsening market for global electronics, as consumers and corporations hold off on spending during an economic downturn. From Apple to Qualcomm Inc. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the tech industry’s bellwethers have warned that a downturn that set in after the pandemic may last longer than initially anticipated.Apple, Hon Hai’s top customer, in August telegraphed its longest sales slump in decades, the result of crumbling demand for phones, computers and tablets worldwide. China, the world’s biggest market for those devices, is mired in an economic funk that some economists say may worsen over time.Apple is asking suppliers to produce about 85 million units of the iPhone 15 this year, roughly in line with the year before, Bloomberg News has reported. That’s aiming to hold shipments steady despite tumult in the global economy and a projected decline in the overall smartphone market. But the move is likely to increase revenue overall because Apple is considering raising the price for Pro models.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysHon Hai’s revenue could be affected by muted iPhone growth in 2023 and potential margin pressure due to residual lockdown impact, less-favorable economies of scale, and capacity relocations. Yet substantial scale benefits and in-house component supplies could enable Hon Hai to cope with slower iPhone momentum and cost pressure better than peers.- Steven Tseng, analystFoxconn is now expanding a steady diversification from China to mitigate the risks of US economic and technology sanctions, a move that could initially impact margins. The Apple partner’s preparing new spending for India north of $1.2 billion, a big outlay for a Taiwanese company that traditionally assembles the vast majority of devices for Apple and other US brands from central and southern China.Longer-term, Foxconn harbours EV ambitions though progress toward that goal has been choppy. A $170-million partnership with Lordstown Motors Corp. fell apart after the Taiwanese company threatened to withhold funding. That incident underscored the challenges Foxconn faces as soaring costs erode already-thin margins in its labour-intensive electronics assembly business."

The panel accused Sebi of having diluted rules that would have helped break through so-called opaque structures and the regulator’s job is made harder by India’s overlapping web of corporate laws that offer loopholes large businesses often exploit.Sebi had sought more time to complete the probe, but the court — amid a slump in Adani shares following a damaging report published in January by US shortseller Hindenburg Research — imposed an Aug. 14 deadline.“I am not confident that Sebi will file a robust case,” said Bhaskar Chakravorti, dean of global business at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. Adani Group “will mostly escape serious negative impact and over time build back up unless the Supreme Court and the regulators do something dramatically different,” he added.Sebi began looking at offshore investments into Adani’s ports, power and infrastructure empire in October 2020. The heart of the matter is whether Adani used companies registered abroad to conduct business and pump up his share prices without properly disclosing affiliations. Adani has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said it has made all required disclosures.Hindenburg’s broadside, more than two years later, reiterated the allegations and heaped pressure on the regulator to hasten the probe.Adani Group and Sebi didn’t respond to requests for comment. The regulator has previously told the Supreme Court it has continuously tightened rules concerning so-called beneficial ownership and related-party transactions, key aspects of a hearing into whether the Adani Group manipulated its stock price.‘Direct Response’In June, Sebi’s board also approved changes mandating additional disclosures from foreign portfolio investors and granular information on their ownership and economic interests from September.Rohit Jain, a managing partner at New Delhi-based law firm Singhania & Co., said the move was a “direct response to the Adani fiasco.”This month, Sebi said it was also considering making India’s conglomerates report transcations involving their unlisted group companies, though it didn’t offer more detail or specify a time line.Shares of Adani’s 10 listed companies have recouped about $47 billion after having lost more than $150 billion of their combined value in the aftermath of the Hindenburg report.The conglomerate is also refocusing on core business interests, acquiring an Indian cement maker and exploring the sale of a roughly $2.6 billion stake in a consumer-staple joint venture with Wilmar International Ltd., Bloomberg News reported earlier this month.“Adani took a hit for a few months,” said Nirmalya Kumar, a marketing professor at Singapore Management University. “But now the doubts about governance have been papered over.”It’s unclear yet what the Sebi report being submitted to the Supreme Court on Monday will contain. The spectrum of possibilities range from no adverse findings to a hard-hitting report that may introduce groundbreaking precedent for minority shareholders.“Adani’s magic combination of incumbency, embedded network of business relationships and continued political clout may win the day,” said Chakravorti at Tufts University. “Adani, despite all the post-Hindenburg brouhaha, will be right there at the head of the pack.”"

Zee’s subscription revenue was up 3 percent in FY23 whereas Sony’s grew 15 percent YoY. “Sony outperformed Zee (in FY23) due to strength in the urban genre, sports properties, and OTT (over-the-top platform) price hikes,” said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president, Elara Capital.How the numbers stack upIn the television vertical, Sony and Zee had a market share of 9.1 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively, in FY23. Hence, the combined entity recorded a total market share of 19.4 percent.Sony’s ad revenue market share stood at 10.7 percent and its subscription revenue market share was 8 percent. As for Zee, its ad and subscription revenue market share stood at 13.3 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.The subscription market share of the combined entity stood at 16.4 percent in FY23. The merged entity, with 24 percent market share in advertising revenue, is only behind Star-Disney, which has a 33 percent share.On the streaming front, Sony India’s OTT platform SonyLIV currently has 33.3 million subscribers, while Zee’s streaming arm Zee5 reported 112 million average monthly active users (MAU) and 11.3 million daily active users (DAU) in FY23. According to industry estimates, Zee5’s subscriber base is pegged in the range of 5-10 million.In terms of financials, Sony recorded a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 1,042 crore in FY23, up 6 percent YoY, whereas Zee’s PAT stood at Rs 251.4 crore, down 76 percent YoY. “Zee faced pressure mainly due to the content cost and its investments in digital,” Taurani noted.Zee’s and Sony’s combined revenue stood at Rs 14,772 crore in FY23.The combined entity’s annual revenue is estimated to be about $2 billion, said Mihir Shah, India head at Media Partners Asia, an advisory and consulting group. He added that the merged entity has an opportunity to scale in sports and streaming, especially with the $1.5 billion funding that will come after the merger.Merger clearedZee and Sony received approval for their merger from the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on August 10, after seven months. Within 30 days of the NCLT order, Zee will have to intimate the registrar of companies, after which the company’s shares will be delisted from stock exchanges and re-listed in another six weeks, said legal experts.The combined entity’s board of directors will also need clearance from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. It is expected that the merger of Zee and Sony is likely to be completed by mid-November."

They now charge 30 rupees ($0.40) extra for the cheese slice in most sandwiches, but are offering a free ""cheezy"" sauce instead.Rising prices for ingredients, including dairy products, have put global fast food chains in India under pressure to trim costs while keeping customers satisfied.Domino's promotion price for its cheapest pizza is just 60 U.S. cents in India, where its franchisee has publicly flagged concerns over a 40% surge in the price of cheese during the financial year that ended in March.Many Subway and McDonald's outlets in India have also removed tomatoes from their menus in recent weeks citing quality issues after prices surged around 450% to record highs.India has resorted to importing tomatoes from Nepal to ease the shortage.The cheese sauce now available for free at Subway India was ""developed for qualitative reasons alone"", said Everstone Group's Culinary Brands, which manages the supply chain for all 800 outlets and is the master franchisee for around 200.The qualitative change clearly isn't to everyone's taste.Subway has ""replaced the cheese slice with liquid cheese blend ... You just lost a loyal customer,"" one unimpressed customer, Sumit Arora, wrote on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.A Subway store manager in New Delhi told Reuters the new cheese sauce costs 400 rupees/kilogram. Market prices show cheese slices typically cost around 700 rupees/kilogram.A cheese slice, said Culinary Brands' marketing head Mayur Hola, ""can be added on at a small cost"". ""Ingredient costs are not something we comment on ... this is simply an upgrade to make our subs better.""Asked about the Subway move, Karan Taurani, a consumer discretionary analyst at India's Elara Capital, said elevated cheese, grain and vegetable prices have pushed restaurants to come up with ""innovative"" strategies.""It is a way of putting inflationary pressure on the customer rather than going for a blanket price hike,"" he said.A Subway sandwich costs around 200-300 rupees ($2.4 to $3.6) in India, and if a customer adds the cheese slice - which was once free - will now cost up to 15% higher.Spokespersons for Subway didn't respond to a request for comment.India's central bank this week raised its inflation forecast for the current fiscal year to 5.4%, citing pressures from food prices."

Absent effective remedial action or another capital raise, it could be lights out","When WeWork Inc finally went public in 2021, the hope was it would leave behind the excesses that were a hallmark of co-founder Adam Neumann’s leadership and become a serious flexible workspace provider for the work-from-home era. This week’s “going concern” warning included in the company’s second-quarter results suggests the next 12 months will every bit as fraught as WeWork’s near implosion four years ago. Absent effective remedial action or another capital raise, it could be lights out.WeWork has terminated hundreds of real estate leases and slashed fixed costs and capital expenditures since its first disastrous attempt to go public in 2019; its workforce has shrunk by 70 percent and fripperies including the corporate Gulf Stream jet have been sold. A debt restructuring in March won additional breathing space by reducing its borrowings, lowering interest payments and extending maturities until 2027.However, the firm still has an ugly balance sheet and continues to lose heaps of money, burning through an eye-watering $650 million in just the past six months and reducing cash reserves to just $205 million.WeWork has lost almost $17 billion since it was founded more than a decade ago.Rectifying this situation in a depressed commercial real estate market will be tough: Tech clients are trimming budgets and WeWork generates most of its sales in the US and UK — chiefly in big cities like London, San Francisco and New York that have a growing surfeit of office space.To be sure, building owners won’t want such an important lessee to fail, leaving them with huge amounts of space to rent out all at once. Hence WeWork has leverage to renegotiate leases, some of which are coming up for renewal. (Canceling long-term leases isn’t straightforward, however, and may require termination fee payments).The company desperately needs to boost revenue via winning more tenants, but the opposite is happening: Memberships have declined 3 percent since December, while occupancy fell to 72 percent from 75 percent during the same period. Boosting membership prices is difficult due to competition with rival shared workspace providers such as IWG Plc, which gained as much as 10 percent in London trading on Wednesday after the WeWork announcement.WeWork needs firm leadership, but instead finds itself with a vacuum: Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani and Chief Financial Officer Andre Fernandez both stepped down unexpectedly in May.Mathrani was a reassuringly sensible adult in the room and, so far the company hasn’t named a permanent replacement. Compounding the sense of drift, three board directors resigned last week due to a “material disagreement” regarding governance and the company’s strategic and tactical direction, according to the latest accounts. The official acknowledgement that the company’s cash reserves might not be sufficient to survive the next 12 months will further unsettle clients.“The perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause members, landlords and others to choose not to do business with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations,” the filing states. WeWork can’t afford to lose customers as it might then have to refund their security deposits, further draining cash.Shareholders were heavily diluted earlier this year when part of WeWork’s debts were equitised – the stock has declined 98 percent since the listing. WeWork has little debt maturing soon, but its bondholders also aren’t optimistic about a full recovery; its $164 million of 7.875 percent senior unsecured notes maturing in 2025 traded at just 33 cents on the dollar this week.Although the debt restructuring cut the company some slack, almost $500 million of borrowings have a floating interest rate that has risen to 15 percent. The company’s decision to draw $175 million from a $475 million Softbank Group Corp affiliate debt facility in July is also not reassuring — in May, former management had said there was no need, while conceding the company wouldn’t reach cashflow breakeven until the second half of 2024.The big unknown is whether majority owner Softbank will ride to the rescue again. The Japanese tech investor has lost a gargantuan sum — $12billion since 2017, according to the Wall Street Journal — on its WeWork misadventure. Another bailout is unappealing — but without one,WeWork’s prospects look bleak.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies in Europe.

The NCLT had initially reserved its verdict on the merger between Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Culver Max Entertainment (previously known as Sony Pictures Networks India) on July 10.The Mumbai bench of NCLT, comprising H V Subba Rao and Madhu Sinha, had reserved the judgment after listening to objections from creditors such as Axis Finance, JC Flower Asset Reconstruction Co, IDBI Bank, Imax Corp, and IDBI Trusteeship who raised concerns about the scheme.In December 2021, Zee Entertainment and Sony Pictures reached an agreement to combine their businesses. Subsequently, both media companies approached the tribunal to seek approval for the merger, having already obtained necessary permissions from the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), and other regulatory bodies like the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).During Zee's Q1 FY24 earnings call, the management expressed optimism that the merger would be concluded smoothly. Punit Goenka, the CEO of Zee Entertainment, clarified that his legal situation and the merger were distinct matters. The company emphasized that, besides the provision affirming his role as an essential part of the merged entity, there were no other changes to the agreement's clauses.Zee Entertainment had declared a merger with Sony Pictures Networks India (SPNI) on September 22. The announcement highlighted that SPNI had acknowledged the inclusion of Punit Goenka as MD and CEO of the combined company as a key aspect of the deal.In a temporary order dated June 12, the Securities and Exchange Board of India had prohibited Subhash Chandra, chairman of Essel Group, and his son Punit Goenka from assuming directorial or major managerial positions due to alleged misuse of funds from Zee for personal gain.The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) upheld SEBI's interim order, imposing a one-year restraint on Zee Entertainment promoters Subhash Chandra and Punit Goenka from holding board positions in publicly listed companies, citing alleged fund diversion."

This comes on the heels of Hyderabad implementing similar measures to deal with gridlocked traffic.Bengaluru City Police Commissioner B Dayananda and senior police officials attended Samparka Divasa, an outreach programme preceding Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara's meeting with IT-BT companies on the Outer Ring Road, which is the tech corridor of Bengaluru.The meeting took place at Ecospace Business Park in Bellandur on the Outer Ring Road from 11 am to 1 pm on August 9 with representatives from tech companies and the Outer Ring Road Companies Association (ORRCA) to discuss various issues, ranging from traffic management to safety.MN Anucheth, Joint Commissioner of Police (Bengaluru Traffic), told Moneycontrol that they suggested several measures to ORRCA and tech companies to streamline traffic. These measures include staggering office timings, particularly for log-outs; promoting carpooling; facilitating dedicated buses for employees; providing cab parking within the campus; and introducing shuttle buses from Metro stations to offices.""Staggering office timings will help us streamline traffic, especially during evening hours. We don't intend to impose specific timings on them but rather encourage them to come up with suitable timings based on their internal assessments. This way, the log-outs of different companies won't coincide,"" he explained.Cyberabad Police had also advised IT companies to practice work-from-home (WFH) and gradually stagger log-outs.Anucheth said that they proposed dedicated buses for employees working on the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and emphasised carpooling to reduce the number of private vehicles on the ORR.Moneycontrol had reported that 6.4 lakh employees commute daily between Silk Board and KR Puram, using 3.3 lakh vehicles, including personal cars and cabs.Anucheth said, ""Private cabs are currently parked on the service roads of ORR. We've suggested allowing the creation of parking spaces for these vehicles within the campuses, given that they are used by their employees.""He also urged ORRCA to operate buses to the nearest Metro stations, similar to the Electronics City Industrial Township Authority (ELCITA), to provide last-mile connectivity to employees.Anucheth said, ""Once the KR Puram-Byappanahalli section and Silk Board station (RV Road-Bommasandra) are operational, ORRCA and companies can conduct an origin and destination study to identify the catchment areas from where these employees are coming. This would enable the provision of first-mile, last-mile connectivity for employees.""While the KR Puram-Byappanahalli Metro section is expected to be operational by August-September 2023, the Silk Board station is likely to be ready by December 2023.Dayanand said that managing Bengaluru traffic is a formidable task. ""Everyone seems to have opinions on traffic management, much like cricket experts. Strengthening public transport and ensuring pedestrian safety are crucial. In fact, pedestrians are more vulnerable to accidents. BMTC has nearly 40 lakh daily riders, so it should get more priority. Various agencies are involved in the city's mobility planning."" He also invited tech firms to visit the Traffic Management Centre on Infantry Road to witness how they manage the city's traffic.Dayanand told Moneycontrol that the interaction with ORRCA and companies was effective. ""The major issue was traffic, but we also explained our plans and sought their suggestions. We are also working on various initiatives to decongest the traffic,"" he said.ORRCA was unavailable for comment.Techies are victims in 90% cyber fraud cases: policeMeanwhile, S Girish, deputy commissioner of police, Whitefield division, said, ""Tech professionals are victims in over 90 percent of cyber fraud cases, underscoring the need for greater awareness. Recently, a techie fell victim to a Rs 1.5-crore cyber fraud. Instances of fraud, such as OTP fraud, part-time job scams, loan fraud, and investment fraud, are abundant."" He further revealed that they receive numerous complaints about two-wheeler and laptop thefts from companies in the tech corridor.Built in phases between 1996 and 2002, the 60-km ORR encircling a significant portion of the city aims to connect major highways for faster travel and reduced congestion in Bengaluru. However, the ORR's flawed design, coupled with the absence of parallel roads, means that a single truck breakdown, fallen tree, or waterlogging can bring the entire tech corridor to a standstill."

IT hardware firms seek time to set up manufacturing facilities in IndiaApple, Dell, HP, Acer, and other computer hardware companies have sought an extension of nine months to a year of the deadline for licenses required for import of laptops, tablets, personal computers, and other items. Executives of these firms said they need this time to set up manufacturing facilities in India in a meeting with officials of the electronics and IT ministry.Why it’s important: The government last week said licenses will be required to import IT hardware, impacting most computer hardware firms. It has given the industry time till October 31 to comply.#2. Adani Group in early exploration to sell stake in FMCG joint venture Adani WilmarThe Adani Group is in the early stages of exploring a stake sale in its FMCG joint venture Adani Wilmar. The 50:50 venture between Adani and Wilmar was set up in 1999. It raised Rs 3,600 crore through an initial public offering in February 2022. The group’s stake is held through Adani Commodities owned by flagship firm Adani Enterprises.Why it’s important: This is in line with the conglomerate’s efforts to focus on core businesses and de-risk its balance sheets by selling stake and hastening loan repayments.#3. Maruti aims for 20 percent of total sales from electric vehicles by 2031Maruti Suzuki India has decided to take over parent Suzuki Motor’s Gujarat plant to ensure better efficiencies, including that of electric vehicles. India’s largest carmaker is aiming for around 15-20 percent of its total car sales to come from battery-powered electric vehicles by 2030-31, chairman R C Bhargava said. It would mean around half a million such vehicles every year, he said.Why it’s important: The sale of electric cars has been slow in India, unlike that of two-wheelers. However, the segment is expected to grow in coming years and Maruti does not want to miss out on the action.#4. Companies can approach tribunal to force disclosures on hidden beneficial ownersCorporate entities can approach the National Company Law Tribunal to force disclosures from an individual suspected of significant but hidden beneficial ownership, or 10 percent of a company, the corporate affairs ministry has said. The onus of reporting the ultimate true owners lies with the companies after a legislative change in February 2019.Why it’s important:  The ministry is in effect nudging companies to be proactive in detecting and reporting individuals who hold significant beneficial interests but remain anonymous by letting proxies collect dividends or attend general meetings. It would boost transparency.#5. Tender process for large construction projects needs urgent fixing, says L&T chiefThe tendering process for awarding construction contracts by the government is broken and needs to be fixed urgently to reduce cost overruns to the tune of trillions of rupees, according to Anil M Naik, outgoing chairman of Larsen & Toubro, India’s largest construction and engineering conglomerate. He expressed willingness to collaborate with the government after retirement to streamline the tendering system.Why it’s important: Naik says less qualified companies often win projects by quoting the lowest figure but fail to complete them in time. This needs to change in the national interest, he said.#6. Private equity firm Carlyle to buy 30 percent of Quest Global for $500 millionPrivate equity investor Carlyle has agreed to acquire a significant minority stake in engineering services firm Quest Global for about $500 million, ending up with about 30 percent stake. Simultaneously, they will together buy back all shares from the company’s existing investors, which include Bain Capital, Advent International, and GIC Re. Founder Ajit Prabhu will also bring in additional funds to increase his stake.Why it’s important: This is one of the biggest investments by Carlyle in recent times. The investment will help Quest to expand its global business before tapping stock markets for further funds.#7. Small businesses and rural borrowers facing increasing stress to repay loansRural borrowers and small businesses are finding it harder to make timely loan repayments due to an erratic monsoon, sluggish demand recovery, and higher interest rates. Besides State Bank of India, non-bank lenders such as Bajaj Finance, Cholamandalam Finance, and L&T Finance have pointed to stress pockets in some sectors.Why it’s important: Lenders are becoming cautious after a lending binge to these segments in the recent past, which has led to an oversupply of credit and higher indebtedness.#8. Mutual funds step up buying equities even as overseas inflows become thinnerMutual funds have stepped up purchases after staying on the fence for over two months. Their net equity investments reached a four-month high of Rs 7,700 crore in July, rising for the fourth straight month after withdrawing a net of Rs 5,100 crore in April. The trend continued in August, with net investments of Rs 3,400 crore in the first three trading sessions, according to data from the Securities and Exchange Board.Why it’s important: The buying by local fund managers comes at a time when daily foreign investor flows have turned negative in five of the previous 12 trading sessions because of rising US bond yields.#9. Gaming start-up Mobile Premier League to lay off 350 staffersIndia's popular online gaming and fantasy sports startup Mobile Premier League will retrench 350 employees, representing about 50 percent of its India workforce. The development comes weeks after the central government implemented a 28 percent tax on online real-money games.Why it’s important: The high tax on betting in online gaming is bound to have a significant impact on the industry. Many of them will have to slim down in order to survive.#10. Pepperfry co-founder Ambareesh Murty dies of cardiac arrest in LadakhAmbareesh Murty, 51, who died late Monday evening in Leh after suffering a cardiac arrest, was remembered as a key architect, mentor, and resilient leader of furniture startup Pepperfry. Murty, who lived in Mumbai, is survived by his wife and a son.Why it’s important: Murthy was the India country manager for eBay before taking the plunge into entrepreneurship and launching Pepperfry. His absence will be keenly felt."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/tycoon-who-gave-away-750-million-sees-profit-in-loans-to-poor-11128461.html,Tycoon who gave away $750 million sees profit in loans to poor,"August 09, 2023 07:03 AM IST","R Thyagarajan is arguably one of the world’s most idiosyncratic financiers — in no small part because his multibillion-dollar business, the Shriram Group, has thrived in an industry that tripped up countless others around the globe.","He built a fortune lending to low-income borrowers shunned by banks. He paid staff below-market wages and thought they still earned too much. He gave away almost all his wealth to a handful of employees, content with his small house and a $5,000 car.R Thyagarajan is arguably one of the world’s most idiosyncratic financiers — in no small part because his multibillion-dollar business, the Shriram Group, has thrived in an industry that tripped up countless others around the globe.A pioneer in extending credit to India’s poor for trucks, tractors and other vehicles, Thyagarajan built Shriram into a conglomerate that employs 108,000 people in everything from insurance to stockbroking. Shares of the group’s flagship firm hit a record in July after jumping more than 35% this year, four times more than India’s benchmark stock index.Now 86, and settled into an advisory role, Thyagarajan said in a rare interview with Bloomberg News that he entered the industry to prove lending to people without credit histories or regular incomes isn’t as risky as it’s perceived. He insists there’s nothing unusual about his approach to business — or his decision to give away a stake in Shriram now valued at more than $750 million.“I’m a bit of a leftist,” RT, as he’s known, said in the south Indian city of Chennai, where he founded the group in 1974. “I was never enthusiastic about making life pleasanter for people who already have a good life.” Rather, I “wanted to take away some unpleasantness in the lives of people who are getting into problems.”Thyagarajan’s career highlights untapped opportunities in the world’s most populous country, as more of its 1.4 billion people strive to enter a growing middle class. Though Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has pushed to expand access to India’s banking services, about a quarter of the nation still doesn’t have access to the formal financial system. And roughly a third of those who do have a bank account never use it, according to the World Bank.Lending to the poor is a form of socialism, Thyagarajan contends. But by offering a cheaper option than the punitive rates available to the unbanked, he has sought to demonstrate that the business can be safe and profitable. And in doing so, he’s persuaded other companies to bring down borrowing costs.Now, the industry is big business. India has about 9,400 so-called shadow banks, which mostly offer financial services to people passed over by conventional lenders.“RT is an outlier,” said Srinivas Balasubramanian, senior partner and head of corporate finance at KPMG India. “Few have sustained and thrived for so long.”Building An EmpireIndeed, Thyagarajan stands out in an industry that has been plagued by ethical challenges and is prone to booms and busts — with blowups sometimes threatening the financial system. The most obvious example is the subprime mortgage crisis in the US. More recently, the collapse of a non-bank lender in Mexico last year wiped out billions for investors.Forging a socialism-inspired lending firm might seem an unexpected career choice for a man who grew up surrounded by servants in a well-to-do farming family in the state of Tamil Nadu. But Thyagarajan said he’s always had an analytical and egalitarian-oriented mind.He studied mathematics at the undergraduate and master’s level in Chennai before spending three years at the prestigious Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata.In 1961, he joined New India Assurance Co., one of India’s largest insurers, starting a spell in finance as a company employee that lasted two decades. It included stints at Vysya Bank, a regional lender, and JB Boda & Co., a reinsurance broker.Along the way, people in Chennai came to him seeking money to buy used trucks, and he gave them loans from his inheritance. Gradually, that side venture morphed into his life’s main act. At 37, he founded Shriram Chits with friends and relatives.The unbanked often rely on so-called chit funds, a collective savings scheme where each member deposits a fixed amount every month. The pot is doled out to one investor a month until everyone has received a share. The money is used for farm equipment, school fees or other large purchases.Over the years, Thyagarajan set up other firms, and Shriram eventually grew into a group of more than 30 companies.In truck financing, Thyagarajan saw people paying rates as steep as 80% because banks wouldn’t deal with them. He concluded that the prevailing thinking was wrong.“People used to think that because the interest rates were very high, the lending was very risky,” he says. “I realized it was not risky at all.”This epiphany would define his life. He decided to lend at rates that were still extremely high by global standards, but lower than other options. “Interest rates went from 30%-35% to 17%-18%,” he said.Thyagarajan says his approach wasn’t about charity. It was infused with two key capitalist beliefs. One was the importance of private-sector entrepreneurship; the other, faith in market principles.That ethos has paid dividends: Shriram collects more than 98% of dues on time, filings show. It gets its lending decisions right, the local unit of S&P Ratings says.More broadly, non-bank financiers like Shriram are crucial for supporting India’s newly banked. They underwrite loans and other products that require skill-sets banks often don’t have, according to Bindu Ananth, co-founder of Dvara Holdings, which backs companies driving financial inclusion.“Ensuring participation of the poor and marginalized in India’s formal financial system is key to driving the economic growth in a sustainable manner,” Ananth said.Shriram Finance Ltd., the flagship, has a market value of about $8.5 billion and made about $200 million in profit in the quarter that ended in June. Only one of the 34 analysts tracking the stock recommends selling it.A Different ApproachLending to the poor can be murky. Exorbitant interest rates routinely lead vulnerable borrowers deeper into debt. In India, loan sharks sometimes resort to heavy-handed debt collection. Consumer protection is especially weak in the microfinance industry, despite its emphasis on lifting up the vulnerable.Asked to explain what Shriram does differently, Thyagarajan said the group doesn’t look at credit scores, for instance, because most customers aren’t part of the formal financial system. Instead, staff rely on references from existing customers.Internally, the company also takes a unique approach to compensation. Thyagarajan has long believed staff are paid too much, even though they get less than market rates. Lower-level employees often earn about 30% less than peers. For senior executives, the discount is as much as 50%.“We would give them as much as they need to keep themselves reasonably happy, not euphoric,” Thyagarajan said. “They shouldn’t be encouraged to compare themselves with all people around them. They would have only misery.”He insists employees are mostly content with this structure. Though pay is less, staff said in interviews that the job comes with more flexibility than at peer firms.“I value the peace of mind, stability and comfort that this job offers,” said Amol Bowlekar, a branch manager for Shriram Finance in Mumbai, who said he has turned down several higher paying job offers. “The group’s culture is more humane. There is no insane pressure to deliver.”Living ModestlyPart of what makes Shriram’s system fair, staff say, is Thyagarajan’s own willingness to live among the masses. For years, he drove a Hyundai hatchback. And he doesn’t own a mobile phone, which he considers a distraction.The tycoon gave away all his shareholdings in Shriram companies to a group of employees, transferring them to the Shriram Ownership Trust, which was set up in 2006. The perpetual trust has 44 group executives as beneficiaries. Executives leave when they retire, taking millions of dollars with them.The total value of the trust’s holding exceeds $750 million and has gone up several-fold in recent years, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified as the information is private.In his three-hour interview with Bloomberg, Thyagarajan said he didn’t need the money then or now — and he ultimately prefers simple pursuits. These days, he spends hours listening to classical music and reading Western business magazines.In December, Shriram Transport Finance Co. absorbed Shriram Capital Ltd. and Shriram City Union Finance Ltd. in a share-swap deal. Shriram Transport finances trucks, while Shriram City Union funds purchases of consumer goods and motorcycles.Thyagarajan says executives planned this for years, but he wasn’t involved in the details. He no longer has a formal role at the company, but every fortnight, senior managers brief him and seek his advice.“I have the personality of a consultant,” Thyagarajan says. “I can see things slightly differently. I’m OK with people not accepting my perception and doing things based on their perception. And if it turns out that I was right and they were wrong, which happens most of the time, I am able to communicate with them later on and say I told you so.”Shriram’s strength is also its weakness, according to Kranthi Bathini, an equity strategist at WealthMills Securities Pvt. in Mumbai. Most customers are non-prime, which means “asset quality and profitability underperformance could come at any point,” he says.There’s also key-person risk, according to Bathini. With “cultish” founders like Thyagarajan, it’s tough for anyone else to lead.Lastly, Bathini says, a left-wing mindset isn’t always great for shareholder returns, though they have been fine so far.Still, Thyagarajan’s record of success is hard to argue with. But he plays down talk that his life is frugal, saying he even occasionally splurges on trips with family to tiger sanctuaries.His one regret isn’t that he gave his wealth away, but how he did it. If he’d realized how profitable Shriram would become, and how much the stock would rise, he would have spread the bounty.“I did not imagine that so much money was going to be distributed to so few,” he says. “I’m not very happy about it. But it’s OK. I’m not very sad either.”"

Premium hotel average room rates (ARRs) across the country are expected to be at Rs 6,000-6,200 in the current financial year.ICRA expects the occupancy to be at decadal highs.Consistent improvement in consumer sentiments despite the inflationary environment, stable corporate performance, and domestic air passenger traffic inching above pre-Covid levels augur well for travel and hotel demand. The demand recovery has been strong in the last year, and ICRA anticipates it to continue in FY2024 as well.Sustenance of domestic leisure travel, higher bookings from meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE), and business travel, along with an increase in foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs), would support demand, the brokerage feels. The industry is also likely to benefit from specific events like the G20 summit and the ICC World Cup 2023.ICRA estimates a 13-15 percent revenue growth for the Indian hotel industry in FY24."

Monetising the stake in SBI Mutual Fund is not a focus for us currently.""At 14.56%, SBI is adequately capitalised, Khara said, adding SBI will ensure capital is not a constraint to supporting balance sheet growth."

Yet both have remained confined to boardrooms and regulations rather than being absorbed as a part of corporate culture,"The joint stock company has been at the heart of modern capital-driven enterprise for over 400 years, ever since the Dutch established the first one in 1602. It has powered explorations and conquests, propelled small trading nations to colonial empires, raised large-scale risk capital, created markets for mass manufactured goods, and transformed rural agrarian economies into powerhouses of industry and services. It has spawned an entire banking, capital markets and financial services industry in the process, which has facilitated the explosion of global trade and the interconnected dependency of goods and services across nations that we see today. In many ways, companies have written the history and economics of the modern world.It is therefore unsurprising that the field of management theory arose from the musings of early economic writers. The writings of Adam Smith and David Ricardo on the division of labour, factors of production, wages, rent, profits, trade and its most visible manifestation, the ""invisible hand"" of markets, were best expressed by the ubiquitous joint stock company. With the explosion of manufacturing, commerce and trade following the Industrial Revolution, companies grew, often becoming large, unwieldy conglomerates with multiple locations of factories and offices, employing staff to conduct business on a scale never seen before in commercial history.Organising operationsAs these companies grew, theories were proposed to organise their operations according to certain principles to maximise efficiency and profit. Fredrick Taylor argued that simplifying jobs through scientific study and identifying the most efficient way to complete a task would increase productivity. Others contributed to the corpus of management knowledge as well. Henri Fayol sought to create an efficient company structure. Max Weber expanded on Taylor's theories, incorporating the concepts of chain of command and standardisation. Over time, the expanding theory of management spawned subdisciplines. Elton Mayo's and Douglas McGregor’s work resulted in the establishment of a branch of human relations management. Philip Kotler's work on advertising, sales, and marketing brought attention to what is now routine but was trailblazing in an era when pricing and production dominated management thought.Financial management also developed in three independent but interrelated ways. The first was the double-entry bookkeeping system, as a theory of accounting and reporting of profit and loss and asset and liability statements. The second was the financial management of the company itself — revenues, wages, production costs, capital budgeting and marketing expenses — and the cash flows of its operations. The third was periodic access to capital — bank debt or market equity — which in turn led to significant work on theories of assessment of cash flows, present value, internal rate of return, cost of capital, et al. This was further extended to financial markets in capital asset pricing, portfolio theory, and option pricing in the works of Merton H Miller, Franco Modigliani, Harry M Markowitz, Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton.What all management thought had in common was that it addressed corporate concerns of that era: a landscape of industrial invention and manufacturing companies as market-dominant, multinational, listed and traded conglomerates that raised funds as debt or equity from banks or public markets and then applied them to turning the wheels of business. However, a transformational shift in the company's business model occurred during the first decade of the third millennium. Of technology and financial disruption destroying and creating corporate value in tidal waves of churn as product, company, and management lifespans became shorter; as industries were phased out and new ones were created; as manufacturing-based models of measurable immediate profit and net cash flow were overshadowed by brand success and capital allocation by markets on the future value of entrepreneurial ventures of yet unproven provenance, even as companies and finance tried to peer into an unclear future by reading technology and market trend tea leaves. This has only accelerated since, and the structure of the economy is shifting into uncharted territory. The future of that structure is uncertain, given the rise of artificial intelligence, robotics, large pools of aggregated private capital, increasing disparities in wealth and income across geographies, and a ""hollowing out"" of the middle class in many countries.Emergence of communicationThe areas of emphasis have also shifted. Manufacturing and traditional corporate processes are now merely routinely important “hygiene” concerns. These have been replaced by market-facing communication such as brand, design, and market dominance; financial communication such as earnings and forecasts, as well as fund-raising; and corporate communication such as public perception shaped by media and events. With the pervasive presence of information shaped as stories in 24x7 media, their impact is instant and disproportionate as compared to previous times. Accusations of pollution, harassment, fraud — the list of things that can instantly and severely damage companies is long. Boards and management are endlessly peering into a fog with limited visibility as they try to navigate these difficult waters of unknown risks.Yet, for the longest time, management theory, companies, and markets have ignored the elephant in the room. Investors have focused almost exclusively on the financial performance and ability of leadership to achieve these — as reflected in a market price — but have paid little attention to improving governance as a means to higher returns and reducing risk, despite many spectacular failures over the years. It is a failure with rising costs as economies enter a disruptive phase fuelled by the fastest rate of technological change and the simplest fundraising in human history. There has been widespread entrepreneurship, with numerous success stories of businesses advancing from concept to market dominance and valuation in less than a decade. However, due to a lack of culture and values, many have imploded at various stages of their young, promising trajectories. Many were avoidable failures. Transparency and governance are more important than ever before.Risk and governanceTwo aspects of management must be addressed in this context. Risk and governance are two sides of the same coin. Yet both have remained confined to boardrooms and regulations rather than being absorbed as a part of corporate culture. There are reasons for this. Both have traditionally been regarded as strategic or oversight functions of the board for managerial accountability. As a result, discussions have focused on management agency or stewardship. They have rarely been seen as a critical component of organisational identity, in theory or practice. Similar to epiphanies, executives are expected to discover governance values only upon promotion to senior positions. Instead of a framework of values within which the everyday processes of companies are meant to be undertaken.This is becoming increasingly important as a funding crisis spreads throughout the startup world. As liquidity recedes, valuations are slashed, and companies struggle, which of them has a better chance of survival? This is an increasingly important question for investors. In a valuation, how (and how well) do you value a company's value system as defined by its key principal actors? Which do you keep, which do you double down on, and which do you sell (if possible)?As another once-promising startup story unravels in the headlines of financial publications, perhaps it is time for markets to start answering this question. For every Byju's, there is also a Zerodha. For every BharatPe, there is a Zoho too. It will require going beyond articulated plans, markets, strategy, and disruption to identify and parse the values that will, in the end, also be key drivers of value. And valuation.Sandeep Hasurkar is an ex-investment banker and author of `Never Too Big To Fail: The Collapse of IL&FS’. Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."

Laptop makers had been bracing for some government measures aimed at reducing reliance on imports and boosting local production, but the sudden licensing imposition caught the industry off-guard, people familiar with the matter said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.Tech firms are now engaging with New Delhi on how to most quickly obtain licenses at a period of heightened consumer interest with India’s Diwali shopping season and back-to-school period approaching, the people said. It’s unclear how long it would take for Apple et al to get licenses, but the halt is already disrupting a multibillion-dollar trade in foreign PCs at a crucial time.Representatives for India’s trade ministry, Apple, Samsung and HP did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The requirement creates additional headaches for manufacturers already grappling with a global glut of inventory and few triggers to restart sales growth. It could result in delayed India launches or even product shortages in a maket that’s still largely reliant on shipments from overseas.The import restriction, an example of India’s sudden policy shifts, adds to longstanding measures designed to discourage bringing in foreign electronics. It’s intended in part to realize longer-term ambitions to create a world-class tech manufacturing industry. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is currently seeking applications for a 170 billion-rupee ($2.1 billion) financial incentive plan to draw makers of laptops, tablets and other hardware to the world’s most populous nation as companies look to diversify supply chains beyond China."

The centre will focus on developing technology for chipmaking tools.Srinivas Satya, president of Applied Materials India, in an interview said the firm attracted as many as 25 of its suppliers from Japan, South Korea, the U.S. and Europe to a flagship semiconductor event in Gujarat last week to assess the market, with multiple states pitching to those firms to set up base.Applied Materials does not manufacture in India - and has no plans to - but having suppliers based locally will help its new engineering centre speed up technology development and testing.""Having the suppliers closer to us is so important just to accelerate our product learning cycle. We want to introduce a much broader set of products, much faster,"" said Satya.""We can accelerate how these technologies get adopted into our high volume manufacturing solutions.""Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been courting investment for India's nascent chip sector with aspirations to develop a chipmaking hub.Though a major chip manufacturing deal has yet to be signed, Advanced Micro Devices last week announced plans to set up a chip design centre in India, while Micron Technology has said it will invest $825 million in a semiconductor testing and packaging unit.Such investment creates opportunities for Applied Materials, the world's biggest maker of tools used in manufacturing chips.""As and when Micron and other global players or domestic players set up their manufacturing plants here, Applied will certainly be ready to support those,"" Satya said.Modi met Applied Materials CEO Gary Dickerson in Washington in June and invited the company to strengthen the chip industry in the south Asian nation.Applied Materials started its India operations in 2002 and has about 7,500 employees in the country working in product development, software and other business operations."

The government must take all steps to avoid short supply and market disruption.One way is announcing objective criteria that will constitute the basis for the grant of licence, Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) co-founder Ajay Srivastava said.In similar cases earlier, criteria like past performance have been used for granting licences.He said the government may inform all firms of their next year's annual import eligibility in terms of the number of units and value in advance.This will save the government from the charges of discrimination and discretion and help firms plan their operations. There will be no need for firms to make applications for licences. The government may also use DGCI&S firm wise data for quantifying incentives, he said.Kolkata-based Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&S) is an arm of the commerce ministry. It is an official organization for collection, compilation and dissemination of India's trade statistics and commercial Information.Then, GTRI said India would also be dragged into disputes by members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).But as the WTO disputes body is dysfunctional, India may have time to respond. India may take the national security plea saying unchecked imports constitute a national security threat, it said.This may sound hollow, but the US has used the same logic while imposing additional tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium to support the American industry. Laptops constitute a bigger threat than steel, lawyers may argue, it added.The basic customs duties on laptop, PC and similar products in India is zero. India cannot increase this duty as it has committed to zero duty on computers and many IT-related products by signing an Information Technology Agreement (ITA) in 1997.The only option to check import was requiring firms to obtain Government permission before importing. Restricting imports is a more severe measure as the government can now restrict the value of imports or who will import, it added.India's imports of affected products was USD 8.8 billion in 2022-2023. The two key products are PCs/laptops, tablets (imports of USD 5.3 billion), and Wifi Dongles, Smart Card Reader, Android TV Boxes etc. (USD 2.6 billion).The import value of products covered under the remaining five tariff lines or product categories like data processing machines was USD 870 million in 2022-23.The global exports of PC/laptops were USD 163 billion in 2022. China is the undisputed leader with an 81 per cent share. Germany, with a 3.5 per cent share, is a distant number two. Top firms Lenovo, Apple, Dell, and HP make most of the laptops/PCs in China.Most electronics products, including laptops, are made of lakhs of components woven into many subassemblies. China looks unbeatable as they make all components. Any new country willing to make laptops has to initially import most such components from China, it said.India has announced a PLI (production linked incentive) scheme offering a 4 per cent incentive on incremental production.It said that though few firms got approval, there were no major takers as import duty on all products in this category was zero. The government increased duty on mobile phones to 20 per cent to provide upfront tariff walls, which helped production take off rapidly. Not possible for laptops due to ITA. The local build-up may not be rapid. Firms may approach the government to cut duty on critical components like PCBA, which may conflict with other PLI schemes.We may be dependent on China for many years for the supply of subassemblies and components. India is a big expanding market; we must try to make laptops, PC and other products whenever we go beyond simple assembly of subassemblies/components, Srivastava said."

The iPad and Macbooks maker reported a better-than-expected 7.9% rise in revenue from China — which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan — to $15.7 billion. And iPhone sales in India grew double-digits to a new high, though executives didn’t disclose precise numbers.China in particular has been a major drag on the global smartphone arena since last year, and has failed to bounce back as anticipated because of post-Covid economic turbulence. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook suggested users in the world’s biggest mobile market were abandoning Android alternatives from its biggest rivals, which include Xiaomi Corp. and Huawei Technologies Co.“Switchers were a very key part of our iPhone results for the quarter, we did set a record,” Cook told analysts on a post-results briefing.China’s smartphone market is struggling alongside a sputtering economy. Shipments have shrunk every quarter since the start of 2022, as consumers tighten their budgets to deal with a post-Covid downturn. The market could bounce back in the fourth quarter when Apple and its rivals typically release their latest devices, but that growth could be weaker than expected, IDC predicts.While unsurprising, the Indian performance also vindicates the company’s renewed focus on a market where the iPhone has long been beyond the reach of many consumers. Apple now views the fast-expanding country as both a massive retail opportunity and an important production base for its gadgets in the longer term.Apple’s revenue there grew by nearly 50% in the year through March to almost $6 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. The company, which just opened its first stores in the country, is planning to extend its network in India as part of an Asia-wide thrust."

Petronet LNG, part owned by GAIL, is also negotiating an extension to beyond 2028 of its long-term LNG deal, under which Qatar supplies 8.5 million tons per year (tpy) of LNG.A deal with GAIL would strengthen prospects for the renewal of Petronet's deal at better pricing, said one of the sources, adding India's target is to sign the two deals by end-September.GAIL is looking to buy 1 million to 1.5 million tpy of LNG from QatarEnergy, the sources said.Indian companies are investing billions of dollars to build gas infrastructure and scouting for long-term deals to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from about 6.5% now.GAIL plans to buy an additional 7 million to 8 million tpy of LNG by 2030 but does not intend to depend on one country for more than 1 million to 2 million tpy of that to avoid the risk of sudden disruption, its head of finance Rakesh Jain said on Monday.The company has two existing contracts to buy a combined 5.8 million tpy of LNG from the United States and a 2.5 million tpy supply contract with SEFE, the former German Gazprom unit.Asia has outpaced Europe in locking in long-term supply from Qatar's two-phase expansion plan that will raise its liquefaction capacity to 126 million tpy by 2027 from 77 million.Qatar has so far signed three LNG supply deals with buyers in China and Bangladesh and is also in advanced talks with Thailand's state energy firm PTT."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/subways-10-billion-price-tag-is-tough-to-swallow-11086051.html,Subway's $10 billion price tag is tough to swallow,"August 03, 2023 11:08 AM IST","Subway's growth-at-any-cost model where it even pipped McDonald's at one point in number of restaurant outlets is coming back to hurt. Subway doesn’t own any of its outlets, which means that to increase profits it either has to add new franchisees or raise fees charged to those franchisees","At a time when the value of an increasing number US companies are exceeding the once unthinkable $1 trillion mark, it feels odd to ask whether businesses can be too big to be profitable. And yet that’s the very question sandwich chain Subway Restaurants Inc. is asking itself right now — and it may not like the answer.Although its distinctive green and yellow signs have become a fixture of American fast casual dining, the closely-held Milford, Conn.-based franchise has yet to find a buyer six months after putting itself up for sale, asking $10 billion. It’s not so much the price tag that’s the issue — McDonald’s Corp has a stock market value of about $213 billion — but rather Subway’s growth-at-any-cost business model. From a few hundred restaurants in the 1970s, it now has nearly 37,000 around the world. At one point a decade ago it even surpassed McDonald’s as the world’s largest chain of restaurant franchises. Under a be everywhere and anywhere strategy, it seems like the company thought any venue was ripe for one of its sandwich shops, from schools to laundromats and even churches.Here’s the rub: Subway doesn’t own any of its outlets, which means that to increase profits it either has to add new franchisees or raise fees charged to those franchisees. That helps to explain why the company put one of its sandwich shops in a house of worship. But how to reduce concern among potential franchisees about oversaturation? The answer is low startup costs. It costs anywhere between $207,050 and $476,900 to open a Subway,according to the company. That’s well below the cost of opening a McDonald’s restaurant, which can be anywhere from $1 million to $2 million. To be sure, Subway’s royalty fee of 8 percent of gross sales and its 4.5 percent advertising fee are high compared with competitors such as Jersey Mike’s, which charges a 6.5 percent royalty and  5 percent for advertising.So while the startup costs look attractive, it’s the fees that really hurt franchisees, especially when franchisees are not given any exclusivity when it comes to a specific territory. “There are no radius restrictions or minimum or maximum population requirements which limit where we can license or open another Subway Restaurant, unless otherwise provided under applicable state law,” according to the company’s 2021 franchise disclosure. A few coffee shops within four blocks of each other in a dense urban city is probably not a problem in terms of competition, but it is when you’re selling a foot-long sandwich or anything similar.For a time, Subway fostered the idea that it was the “healthy” alternative to fast food, whose horrors for your health spread through films like Fast Food Nation. But as consumers became increasingly aware of food ingredients, additives and fillers, Subway was slow to evolve along with them. It drewscrutiny over the ingredients of its bread, the freshness of its vegetables and the contents of its tuna. Subway’s reputation took a serious blow in 2015 when its spokesperson Jared Fogle was convicted of sex crimes against children.Fast forward to today and the company closes one store for almost every one it opens. This trend is, naturally, bad for royalties by keeping them flat. And when combined with rising borrowing costs and uncertainties around the economic outlook, none of this bodes well for Subway’s $10 billion asking price. JPMorgan Chase & Co, which is handling the sale, is dangling a $5 billion debt financing package to help entice skittish buyers worried about where they’d get the money to buy the company, according to Reuters. It’s no small concern: Although Subway reported 10 consecutive quarters of positive sales growth in April, its franchisees still lag behind competitors. Jersey Mike’s average store volume reached $1.2 million in 2022, well above Subway’s $492,536 average during the same time, according to FranData, a franchise data analysis company.Subway has made some significant changes over the last few years. Under new Chief Executive Officer John Chidsey, who took over in late 2019, the company has revamped its menu, remodeled stores, expanded its rewards program and dropped its $5 “footlong” deal, which drew traffic but ate into profits. The company is improving its reputation by slicing its deli meats fresh in some restaurants, and plans to expand its North America store fleet by 35 percent this year while growing its international footprint, which Chidsey says could reach 40,000 to 60,000 new restaurants.That last part sounds a lot like more of the same business model that largely got Subway into the jam it’s in now. There’s still time for Subway to take a lesson from former Popeye’s Louisiana Kitchen Chief Executive Officer Cheryl Bachelder’s turnaround playbook. Bachelder’s strategy centered around a “ servant leadership” ethos focused on mending fractured relationships with franchisees. The strategy worked. Popeye’s quadrupled its share price and increased average restaurant sales by 45 percent. The company eventually sold to Restaurants Brand International in 2017 for $1.8 billion, about 21 times its cash flow.Leticia Miranda is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering consumer goods and the retail industry.

It has a 6.6-MTPA (Million Tonnes per annum) capacity clinker plant and a 6.1-MTPA capacity cement Plant.""We will also invest in deepening and expanding the captive port capacity in order to accommodate larger vessel sizes of 8000 DWT,"" said Karan Adani speaking after the acquisition of Sanghi Industries.Bulk terminals and grinding units will be created along the western coast to enable the movement of clinker and cement through the sea route at the lowest possible cost.""Our vision is to produce lowest cost clinker in the country at Sanhipuram and then transport this clinker as well as bulk cement through coastal roads to the markets of Saurashtra South Gujarat, Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan Region Karnataka and kerala,"" he said, adding ""Synergies with the assets of Adani ports will help us in implementation of this strategy."" He further said that with the right implementation, he is very ""confident"" that Adani Group will be the lowest-cost supplier of cement in all of these markets.Sanghi Cement's Sanghipuram unit is India's largest single-location cement and clinker unit by capacity, with a captive jetty and captive power plant.The deal would help Adani Cement Ltd (ACL), the second biggest manufacturer after UltraTech, to expand its capacity to 73.6 MTPA (Million Tonnes per annum) in the segment, in which it had entered last September, after the acquisition of majority stakes in Ambuja Cement and its subsidiary ACC Ltd.""The acquisition of Sanghi industries will help Ambuja to strengthen its market leadership and increase its cement capacity to 73.6 MTPA from the current capacity of 67.5 MTPA,"" he said.With the ongoing capex of 14 MTPA and commissioning of 5.5 MTPA cement capacity at Dhaez and Ametha in the second quarter of FY23, the Adani group's capacity will be 100.1 MTPA by 2025.""Ambuja Cement's goal of 140 MTPA capacity by 2028 is well on track.

Months after seeking clearance for its own $1 billion investment in India, BYD is no longer keen to pursue the approval, Reuters reported. In a further setback, BYD is facing an investigation over allegations that it underpaid import tax in India.Among other concerns, Indian officials are worried about the national security implications of Chinese-made vehicles and the data they could collect. India is ""uncomfortable with Chinese automakers,"" an official said.While all investments from China have faced tightened approval requirements in India since a border clash between the two in 2020, there could be an outsized effect on the developing market for EVs in India because of China's dominance in battery materials, battery production and other technology.Tesla, too, has Chinese suppliers that have helped it slash production costs at its Shanghai factory and it now wants to bring them to India - where it appears to have an upper hand in talks with New Delhi.India has told Tesla it will allow its Chinese suppliers into the country if they forge partnerships with local firms, just like Apple did. But at the same time, India is hesitant on BYD's $1-billion plan even though that too was proposed as a partnership with a domestic engineering firm.The Global Times, a Chinese state-run newspaper, said the reported pushback on BYD's investment plan ""will lead to a chain reaction and deal a blow to the overall confidence of Chinese companies in investing India.""BYD has not commented on its $1 billion India plan while Musk, after meeting Modi, said Tesla plans to make significant investments in the country.INDIA'S GROWING EV MARKETTesla wants to sell 20 million cars globally by 2030, up from 1.31 million in 2022, but faces hurdles to expanding its Shanghai factory.BYD was the world's biggest seller of EVs and plug-in hybrids in 2022 with a total of 1.86 million units - the vast majority in China. It trails Tesla in terms of sales of fully electric cars.""Tesla sees competition mainly with BYD, and both are expanding globally at great speed,"" said Gaurav Vangaal of S&P Global Mobility.""If they want volumes, they have to come to India,"" he said, adding that with the government incentivising companies to build EVs locally, India can also serve as an export base.Annual production of light electric vehicles in India is expected to rise to 1.4 million by 2030, close to 19% of total forecast production of 7.25 million, according to estimates by S&P Global Mobility. It was less than 50,000 in 2022.India's nascent EV market is dominated by local player Tata Motors, whose best-selling Nexon EV sells for as high as $19,000 while Chinese carmaker MG Motor's ZS EV starts at $28,000 while BYD's Atto 3 retails at around $41,000 in India.Toyota Motor, Hyundai Motor and Kia all sell mid-sized gasoline SUVs priced at around $24,000, Tesla's identified entry point.Tesla does not currently sell vehicles in India.""Tesla has become a desirable product in name alone,"" said Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions. ""Add to that an affordable product tailored for the Indian market and it has the potential to be a hit locally."""

The DRI is yet to issue a final notice to BYD, which can challenge the findings.BYD in India and China did not reply to several requests seeking comment.India's finance ministry did not reply to an email and WhatsApp message seeking comment.BYD is facing heightened scrutiny from New Delhi over a $1 billion proposal to build cars locally, amid tighter rules on foreign investment from bordering nations, including China. BYD told its Indian joint venture partner it had considered dropping the investment plans.Companies from China have come under the spotlight in India since 2020 when border clashes broke out between the neighbours.Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp has been accused of illegal remittances to foreign entities in the name of royalties, allegations it has denied and challenged in court.India taxes imports of fully built electric cars at 70% or 100% based on the value of the vehicle, but levies 15% or 35% on imports of car parts that are then assembled locally into an EV.Those lower rates, however, are only applicable when parts such as a battery pack or motor are imported, without being mounted on a vehicle chassis.One of the sources said BYD had not met these conditions, making it liable to pay either 70% or 100% depending on the value of the car.Neither the time period over which the alleged violation took place nor the number of cars affected was immediately clear.BYD, which has already invested more than $200 million in India, markets the Atto 3 electric SUV and the e6 EV to corporate fleets and plans to launch its Seal electric sedan later this year.It has sold about 1,960 cars in India since starting sales in 2022, government registration data shows."

The Kerala Story turned out to be the biggest film at the box office in the June quarter.","Multiplex chain PVR Inox is seeing stability at the box office across languages, including Hindi, which until the previous three months had witnessed high volatility.The company said that they are seeing smaller Bollywood films performing well at the box office. The Kerala Story turned out to be the biggest film at the box office in the June quarter.""Along with The Kerala Story, some of the Hollywood films started doing well. Also, the concern of small- to mid-budget films not doing well wasn't there as this segment picked up, and a lot of smaller Hindi films like Zara Hatke Zara Bachke and Satyaprem Ki Katha did quite well. As a result of that, the box office was stable. While the box office business did not pick up pace, volatility was low in the first quarter. And we expect box office momentum to increase from here on, as August is looking promising. August 11 releases like Gadar 2 are seeing good traction. Then in September, we have Jawan,"" Nitin Sood, Group Chief Financial Officer (CFO), PVR Inox, told Moneycontrol.Compared to the March quarter of the financial year 2023, when gross box office collection (GBOC) was at Rs 726.3 crore, the June quarter reported Rs 830.3 crore. While India GBOC of regional movies was down from Rs 1,289.9 crore in Q4 FY23 to Rs 1,081.5 crore in the quarter ended June, PVR Inox recorded a 5 percent growth in regional GBOC at Rs 241.1 crore, up from Rs 229.3 crore in Q4 FY23.""April was slow, but in May and June, the box office picked up a bit. Also, there is less pessimism around the Hindi box office, and Hollywood is back both in terms of box office and content availability. Regional (box office) is also stable. We see stability in all language content,"" Sood added.The company added that the success rate of films at the box office has been improving.India GBOC of Hollywood films increased 69 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) from Rs 254 crore in the March quarter to Rs 430 crore in Q1 FY24. The number of English movies released increased to 27 in Q1 FY24 from 24 in Q4 FY24 and 17 in Q1 FY23.The company also saw some recovery in footfalls sequentially. Footfalls increased to 33.9 million in the June quarter from 30.5 million in Q4 FY23. But it is down annually from 43.4 million. ""July has been an outstanding month. And with the lineup we have in August and September, things look positive,"" Sood said.Ad spendsOn the back of a strong content lineup, the company also expects an improvement in advertising revenue, which has been a laggard. ""In July, we started getting more inquiries, but from Q3 onwards, we will start to see the real impact. There were concerns among advertisers because of the negative commentary on films not doing well. But that negative commentary has gone away. So, a lot of brands are ready for advertising,"" said Sood.Starting the September quarter, recovery will clearly be seen in cinema advertising, said Gautam Dutta, Co-CEO (North and South), PVR Inox, during the earnings call.""Thanks to some big releases in July, the overall noise level around cinemas is positive, and we are getting big accounts back. What was missing were long-term campaigns, which were held back because of negative chatter around the box office. Over the next 60-90 days, we look to close deals. Sectors like telecom and consumer durables, we believe, will come back strongly. We used to have 10-15 big clients throughout the year, which we are missing, and we hope to get them back,"" said Dutta.Advertising income fell to Rs 89.3 crore in the June quarter from Rs 90.7 crore in Q4 FY23 and Rs 93.1 crore in Q1 FY23.Dutta said that ad income will bounce back sharply once cinema starts to deliver footfalls. That process has now begun.Cricket contentThe company is also looking at screening World Cup cricket matches starting in October. ""We are still in the discussion phase for World Cup matches, said Sood.Dutta said that the company is in the process of signing the contract. ""Mostly, we will screen India matches. Historically, we have done many shows for one-day matches. We go to corporates that end up sponsoring a certain match. And they are the ones who call in people while some tickets are left to sell at the box office. In the past, we have seen some key matches garner great interest,"" he added.F&B salesIn the June quarter, food and beverage (F&B) revenue also helped the business narrow its losses. ""We are seeing a positive trend, and the offer on F&B has been well received. In the near term, it will continue, and depending on response and data, we will fine-tune the discount,"" said Sood.The multiplex operator reported F&B revenue of Rs 4,27.7 crore, up from Rs 352 crore in Q4 FY23. However, it was down 12 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis.""All the chatter around F&B pricing being too high is mitigated, and we are getting a good strike rate,"" said Dutta.Screen expansionOn the issue of screen expansion, Sood said that the company opened 31 screens in Q1 FY24 and 46 screens to date. The company plans to add 150-170 screens in FY24. PVR Inox also shut down 14 screens in the June quarter. In total, the company added 17 screens to its portfolio in Q1. ""We intend to shut down around 2-3 percent of our screens. That number works out to between 50-60 screens,"" said Sood.The company is also looking at increasing the portfolio of its premium formats, which include IMAX and Ice theatres, among others. Special or premium formats, which are around 229 screens, account for 13.5 percent of overall screens. We are rolling out more of these in various properties that are coming up and also in some of our existing theatres. These special formats have further room for growth. The percentage (share in the screen portfolio) will grow to 15-20 percent,"" said Sanjeev Kumar, Executive Director, PVR Inox, during the earnings call."

India and Thailand are likely contenders for production sites, he said, adding that he expected India to be crucial to MIH's longer-term growth.""You build where the potential market is...In India or Southeast Asia, you have a huge volume opportunity right now,"" Cheng said, calling India a potential ""emerging power for the next generation"" in the EV sector.MIH had not previously described its manufacturing strategy or the potential customers for its new vehicle.Since 2021, Foxconn has had a joint venture with Thailand's state-energy company PTT centred on EVs, an area of focus for the Southeast Asian country's government.For its part, Foxconn has so far failed to land the kind of deal that would show the EV market can be opened to the type of contract manufacturing that Foxconn came to dominate in consumer electronics for Apple's iPhone.Foxconn established the MIH consortium of some 2,600 suppliers two years ago with the aim of creating an open platform that could become the equivalent of Google's Android operating system for EVs.Cheng conceded MIH had ""not seen success yet"" but said returns for participating suppliers would come with orders for a range of new EVs called Project X. The idea is to use low-cost, shared platforms to allow corporate fleet operators to order custom-made EVs.So far, that model is largely untested, and analysts have said the best opportunity for a new EV entrant like Foxconn could close in the next few years as established automakers and startups ramp up their own production.MIH plans to start production of the three-seat EV about 18 to 24 months after the prototype is unveiled in October, Cheng said. A six-seat EV is scheduled to follow in 2024 and a nine-seat model in 2025.Based on its timeline, it would take MIH four years or more from its founding to first sales in a best case scenario.But Cheng, who was a co-founder of Chinese EV maker NIO and headed Fiat's joint venture in China before joining Foxconn, said Tesla's success with its large Shanghai plant showed how quickly an EV maker could scale up.""I'm building another Shanghai, probably in India,"" Cheng said. ""If this is a Foxconn plant, fantastic, it's the mother company, we put it into the Foxconn plant. If this is a local India plant and it's even more competitive, give it to the India plant.""Foxconn, which only produces a small number of EVs at present, has set an initial target of gaining a 5% share of the global market by 2025. MIH's sales will count towards Foxconn's target, Cheng said."

However, there may be further clarification issued on the definition of online gaming during the council's upcoming meeting on Wednesday, August 2.Tamil Nadu IT Minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan called the claims of 28 percent GST leading to a demise of the online gaming industry as exaggeragted and emphasised the need for a harmonious balance between regulating the industry, generating revenue and supporting continued growth to boost the economy. You can catch that entire conversation here.Dhebar mentioned that course correction has now begun with the IPO not happening in the near future and with all the uncertainty looming over the sector. He also mentioned that the online gaming sector on a segment revenue basis is still negative.For the June quarter, the company's online gaming revenue stood at Rs 43.12 crore, which is little changed from last June's figure of Rs 43.83 crore, but lower than the March quarter number of Rs 47.41 crore. However, revenue from gaming operations, which is the company's core business, increased both year-on-year, as well as sequentially.Delta Corp reported its highest-ever quarterly revenue during the April-June period.""We are hoping to turn it positive (online gaming revenue) in the third quarter,"" Dhebar said.Shares of Delta Corp returned to the Rs 200 mark last week for the first time after July 12, when it had its biggest single-day drop on record. The stock is still down 7.1 percent on a year-to-date basis."

The project planned at Kancheepuram district is likely to generate about 6,000 jobs.Apple suppliers such as Foxconn have ramped up business in India over the past few years thanks to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s incentives to boost local manufacturing. States such as Karnataka have also wooed companies with quick decision making, cutting down on red tape and throwing in subsidies.Foxconn’s moves in India highlight how the South Asian nation has fast become a popular destination for manufacturers scouting for an alternative to China amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing. It’s also the result of a shift in the global supply chain that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, and could reshape the way electronics are made.The new component factory plans are in addition to $700 million that Foxconn is investing to build a plant on a 300-acre site close to the airport in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka, Bloomberg previously reported.

The regulator is also reviewing whether stakes the banking group holds in two wholly-owned insurance units pose any risks to the firm’s stability, the people said.India has tightened rules limiting bank CEOs’ tenure to a maximum of 15 years and has been reviewing the stakes that banks hold in insurers in order to strengthen the nation’s financial system. RBI had said in 2021 that the outgoing head should take a three-year cooling period and shall not be “appointed or associated with the bank or its group entities in any capacity, either directly or indirectly,” to ensure there is a clean break for the outgoing head from the bank.Kotak’s tenure as CEO of India’s fourth-largest private lender ends this year. He has received shareholder approval to subsequently remain on the board. Choosing one of his lieutenants from within the bank’s ranks, while he is on the board, will defy the spirit of the regulations, leaving Kotak in a position to potentially influence decisions, according to the people.An outsider coming in as CEO might be “a slight negative and adds uncertainty around management changes,” Jefferies Financial Group Inc. analysts Vinayak Agarwal and Prakhar Sharma said in a note to clients on Monday. By the end of August, “the bank is expected to suggest at least three names in the order of preference, of which the RBI will approve one for appointment,” according to the note.Shares of the Mumbai-based bank fell 1.2%, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index rose 0.3% as of 12 pm in Mumbai trading. Year-to-date the stock has risen 1.5%, compared with a 9% jump in the 30-stock index.A spokesperson for Kotak Mahindra said “current holdings of Kotak in its insurance companies are as per the extant regulatory prescriptions and processes,” and declined to comment on the CEO selection. An RBI spokesperson didn’t respond to emails seeking comments.The financier had engaged consulting firm Egon Zehnder to lead a global search for a CEO and its top executives Shanti Ekambaram and K.V.S.

A spokesperson for Morgan Stanley declined to comment.In the past, Kotak had challenged the RBI in court to retain his stake in the lender at a level above the regulator’s threshold. The bank had then argued that the central bank wasn’t empowered to dictate founders’ shareholdings as RBI sought to separate management and ownership functions at lenders to improve corporate governance.Kotak has a net worth of about $14.5 billion, most of which comes from his 26% stake in the bank, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He has led the bank since it was converted into a lender in 2003 from a non-banking finance company."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/morning-scan-all-the-big-stories-to-get-you-started-for-the-day-522-11062651.html,Morning Scan: All the big stories to get you started for the day,"July 31, 2023 07:18 AM IST",A round-up of top newspaper stories to keep you ahead of others,"#1. Equity valuations in India surge despite moderation on corporate earningsEquity valuations are rising again after they cooled in the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022. The trailing price-to-earnings multiple on Sensex companies has risen to a 17-month high of nearly 25x from 23.7x at the end of December and 21.6x at the end of June last year. Similarly, the trailing price-to-book value ratio is 3.6x, up from 3.4x at the end of December and highest since December 2021. The steady rise has been largely due to higher stock prices and not because of faster growth in corporate earnings.Why it’s important: The rising gap between rich valuations and subdued earnings is bound to weigh on stock prices sooner or later. The recent bull run may not sustain at these levels.#2. Corporate India mostly delivers on street expectations in fiscal first quarterCorporate earnings in the June quarter of 2023-24 have met and in some cases exceeded market expectations, according to an analysis of 456 companies that have declared results so far. The aggregate net profit and revenue of these firms grew 32 percent and 7.88 percent from a year earlier. Profits have grown at the fastest pace in eight quarters.Why it’s important: The good performance is almost entirely driven by the financial sector firms. Expectations were muted to start with on weak guidance by IT companies.#3. National Stock Exchange may extend trading hours, smaller brokers may sufferThe National Stock Exchange may gradually extend trade timings that are presently set at six hours and 15 minutes of regular market. The proposal will have to be approved by the markets regulator and could be extended to derivatives contracts, according to chief executive Ashish Kumar Chauhan. Currently, regular trading on NSE and BSE is from 9:15am to 3:30pm for stocks after a pre-open session from 9am to 9:15am.Why it’s important: Although expanded trading hours may benefit some investors, there are concerns that it would mean an additional cost burden on small brokers, placing them at a disadvantage.#4. Capital expenditure increasing gradually on healthy balance sheets and cash flowsIndian companies are gradually stepping up capital spending, lifted by improving balance sheets and rising cash flows, an analysis by the ET Intelligence Group showed. Three out of four firms from a sample of 373 constituents of BSE 500 index reported year-on-year improvement in gross fixed assets. Companies from capital-intensive sectors form a major chunk of incremental increase.Why it’s important: Although the government has been stepping on the gas on capital expenditure, the private sector has been dragging its feet on demand concerns. A change in that trend would be welcome.#5. Tiger Global completes exit from Flipkart, posting $3.5 billion in phased selloffInvestment firm Tiger Global has completed its exit from Flipkart, recording a staggering $3.5 billion in total gains over the past few years of a phased selloff. It told limited partners last week that it has sold the remaining 4 percent stake it held in Flipkart to US parent Walmart.Why it’s important: The huge gains is the most Tiger Global has earned from a single company and the highest cash return from an Indian internet firm.#6. Nirma Group emerges as frontrunner to acquire Glenmark Life SciencesThe Nirma Group is the likely bidder to acquire Glenmark Life Sciences, an 82.84 percent unit of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals. The Ahmedabad-based conglomerate emerged as the sole bidder late last week. Nirma is using healthcare unit Aculife Healthcare as the likely vehicle for the acquisition. Nirma is likely to have offered a slight premium to the current market price.Why it’s important: A successful deal will trigger an open offer for the remaining stake. The transaction will help promoter Glenn Saldanha deleverage the balance sheet of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.#7. India-Canada trade deal may not include labour, intellectual property issuesThe proposed early harvest agreement between India and Canada is unlikely to see the inclusion of non-trade issues such as environment, digital trade, and labour at this stage. The focus of negotiations for the deal is on goods, trade remedies, dispute settlement, rules of origin, services investment, and customs and trade facilitation. The deal is likely to be signed by the end of this year.Why it’s important: India is reluctant to commit on these sensitive issues since the nations are working out an early harvest deal and not a comprehensive one.#8. Third phase of electric vehicle incentives may jump to Rs 30,000 croreThe central government may triple the subsidy allocation for electric vehicle purchases in the third edition of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) program. Allocation for the FAME III scheme may jump to around Rs 30,000 crore from Rs 10,000 crore earmarked for the current FAME II scheme. Consultations have started and final allocations have not been decided.Why it’s important: The purchase incentives would hasten the rising popularity of electric vehicles in India. The sale of electric two-wheelers may have already crossed an inflection point, and better charging infrastructure would add to the momentum.#9. Go First aims to secure higher interim financing, operate fewer flightsBankrupt Go First airline aims to secure higher interim financing of Rs 600-700 crore from banks and start with fewer flights than earlier planned in its revised strategy to resume operations. The insolvent carrier earlier saw restarting flight operations with 26 aircraft through an interim financing of Rs 400-500 crore.Why it’s important: It remains to be seen if the distressed carrier is able to raise more interim funding as it already owes at more than Rs 6,500 crore to creditors. It’s first priority is to restart operations.#10. Recruitment in IT firms could be 40 percent lower, hurting campus placementsAlthough software services firms are coming to campuses, no one is making a hiring commitment, many technical schools have said. Several institutes said Infosys and Wipro have not yet approached them for placements, making it the second year that both companies will miss the placement season. Only Tata Consultancy Services has announced a hiring target of 40,000 for the year to March.Why it’s important: Macroeconomic uncertainty and muted business outlook in key Western markets are likely to impact campus hiring. Freshers could find it more difficult to land a software job."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/byd-tells-india-partner-it-wants-to-drop-1-billion-ev-investment-plan-report-11049991.html,BYD tells India partner it wants to drop $1 billion EV investment plan: Report,"July 28, 2023 02:44 PM IST","BYD and its partner, privately held Megha Engineering and Infrastructures submitted a proposal to the Indian government in April to jointly build electric cars in India, Reuters reported earlier this month.","China's BYD has told its India joint-venture partner it would shelve plans for a new $1-billion investment to build electric cars after its investment proposal faced scrutiny from New Delhi, two people with knowledge of the discussions said.BYD and its partner, privately held Megha Engineering and Infrastructures submitted a proposal to the Indian government in April to jointly build electric cars in India, Reuters reported earlier this month.But in the initial review, officials from three Indian ministries, including finance and external affairs, raised what two Indian officials described as security concerns about investment from the Chinese company and signalled opposition.BYD executives told Megha Engineering last week that the battery and EV maker wanted to drop pursuit of the investment, according to the two people with knowledge of that exchange.It was not immediately clear whether BYD could have second-thoughts, and as of Thursday BYD had not formally withdrawn the investment proposal from government review, the two officials with knowledge of the review said.BYD, China's largest EV maker, declined to comment on the status of its investment proposal and whether it would pull the plan to produce electric cars in India.In a statement to Reuters, the company said it has had a presence in India for 16 years, selling both passenger cars and electric-drive buses.India's finance, external affairs and home ministry did not reply to an email seeking comment. Megha Engineering did not respond to request to comment.During a meeting last week, Hyderabad-based Megha Engineering urged BYD to wait for more clarity on the situation before moving to drop the electric cars manufacturing plan, according to the two people with knowledge of the discussion.BYD had understood its investment proposal would be politically charged because of the scrutiny of Chinese investment in India and had attempted to head off concerns, the two people with knowledge of its planning said.For instance, the proposal said voice-activated commands for apps would be available in Indian languages in BYD electric cars built in India and that all data from the vehicles would be housed in India, one of the people said.BYD had proposed starting production in India by 2025, the people familiar with the plan said.India began subjecting investment from China to closer scrutiny in 2020 amid a series of border clashes between the two countries.China's Great Wall Motor shelved its plans to invest $1 billion after failing to get clearances from the Indian government.A final decision on whether to approve BYD's investment proposal would be taken by Indian ministries of trade and heavy industries.BYD, the world's largest producer of EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles, entered the Indian market in 2007 producing batteries and components for mobile phone makers.In 2013 it started building electric buses in India with Megha Engineering, under a joint venture company called Olectra Greentech.BYD, which has already invested over $200 million in India, markets the Atto 3 electric SUV and the e6 EV to corporate fleets and plans to launch sales of its Seal electric sedan later this year.BYD has sold about 1,950 cars in India since starting sales in 2022, according to government registration data.India's EV market is small but growing with domestic automaker Tata Motors dominating sales. Electric models made up less than 2% of total car sales in 2022 but the government wants to grow this to 30% by 2030."

The index tracks the 50 most traded watches on the secondary market by value and consists mainly of Rolex, Patek and AP models. Higher interest rates, shaky economic growth and the collapse of cryptocurrency values have combined to push up the supply of used luxury timepieces and push down prices after a surge in 2021.Yet some mid-priced watches from brands also including TAG Heuer and Tudor are bucking the trend, according to data from Subdial, a UK-based used watch dealer and trading platform.The value of a group of five selected watches has gained 17% in a year. The price rise shows collectors and enthusiasts are looking for rare undervalued timepieces and, in some cases, smaller-sized watches.The 36-millimeter diameter Omega Seamaster dive watch now fetches about $5,253. Subdial co-founder Christy Davis said the model is gaining because it captures both the trend toward more discreet luxury goods and smaller sizes.The Santos Galbee, much smaller than the average watch at just 28 millimeters and trading at about $5,060, also speaks to the trend and is part of the rise in popularity of so-called “neo-vintage” watches from the 1990s, he said.The top performing watch in the Bloomberg Subdial Watch Index in the past 30 days is also a smaller watch. The Rolex Datejust 36 outperformed other models made by Switzerland’s largest watch brand, gaining about 3.4% in a month and is trading at around $10,200.The worst performer is the Rolex Daytona in steel and gold, which has declined about 7% to about $18,150.Analysts at Morgan Stanley published a report earlier this week showing that while the most in-demand watches from Rolex, Patek and AP continue to trade above retail on the secondary market, prices are expected to continue falling in the third quarter due to elevated supply levels."

Separately, unit Adani New Industries Ltd. has raised $394 million via a loan from Barclays and Deutsche Bank for a solar module project.Adani Group has started making a comeback in fundraising in recent months following an improvement in its debt metrics. The latest efforts to secure loan deals indicate the conglomerate is further restoring investor confidence after short seller Hindenburg accused it of widespread corporate malfeasance in January.Adani has vehemently denied the allegations, and the company’s shares and bonds have recouped some losses from an initial selloff that at one point had wiped out more than $150 billion of the group’s market value.In June, AdaniConneX Pvt sold $213 million of senior debt to finance data center construction, while Adani Enterprises Ltd. raised 12.5 billion rupees ($153 million) through a local-currency bond sale this month.The conglomerate is also in discussions with other lenders as it seeks to refinance as much as $3.8 billion of a loan facility taken for its Ambuja acquisition.

Emirates Steel was considered the most serious contender to buy a stake in the Thyssenkrupp unit.Interest from India’s JSW Steel Ltd. has also waned, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.The development could hamper efforts by Thyssenkrupp’s new chief executive officer, Miguel Angel Lopez Borrego, to turn around the company. His predecessor had struggled to find a solution for the steel unit amid pushback from unions and volatile earnings.Bloomberg News first revealed in April that Emirates Steel, which has supplied materials for the world’s tallest building, was pursuing a potential investment in Thyssenkrupp’s steel unit. The Abu Dhabi company confirmed at the time it was exploring ways to expand its business with various partners as part of an “ambitious growth strategy.”A deal with Emirates Steel would have helped boost Thyssenkrupp’s plans to transition to low-carbon steel production. The two firms had discussed Emirates Steel producing energy-intensive products in the United Arab Emirates using renewable power before shipping them to Germany, where Thyssenkrupp could shape them into finished products for the automotive industry, people with knowledge of the matter have said.Talks could still be revived and other interested parties could emerge. Spokespeople for JSW and Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. A representative for Emirates Steel didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment."

Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s conglomerate is also in discussions with other lenders, as it seeks to refinance as much as $3.8 billion of a loan facility taken for its Ambuja acquisition.If executed, the loan of as much as $750 million would be part of that broader refinancing. The talks haven’t yet concluded, and the amounts could still change.Adani Group, Barclays, Deutsche and Standard Chartered all declined to comment.The discussions take place six months after US shortseller Hindenburg accused the Adani Group of widespread corporate malfeasance in January, prompting a surge in dollar borrowing costs. Adani has denied the allegations, and the company’s cost of capital has dropped again.With its debt metrics improving, the conglomerate has returned to fundraising.AdaniConneX sold $213 million worth of senior debt to finance data center construction in June, while flagship Adani Enterprises Ltd. firm raised 12.5 billion rupees through a local currency bond sale earlier this month.Adani’s purchase of Holcim Ltd.’s Indian cement assets last year made the conglomerate the country’s second-largest producer of the construction material.To finance that deal, bridge loans maturing in 2023 and 2024 were taken out by Mauritius-domiciled Endeavour Trade & Investment, the Adani Group vehicle that acquired Holcim’s cement business."

Over the last five years, the country notched up the highest investment volume in Asia, according to research from the Global Private Capital Association, a body representing investors.“There are global managers sitting on the fence who have regular dialogues with us on the Indian private credit opportunity,” according to Bharat Gupta, partner at Ernst & Young India. He expects more to join the fray in the next couple of years.The growth in private lending illustrates broader asset flows in India. Alternative investments reached a record 3.4 trillion rupees ($41.5 billion) in March, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India. That’s come as money has flowed out of mutual funds in the wake of an earlier credit crisis.Read More: Fresh Crisis Looms for India Shadow Banks After Fund ShutsWhile still a fraction of the global $1.5 trillion assets under management for private credit, India has become a hotspot for alternative asset managers specialized in lending at higher interest rates. Apollo is hunting for a credit chief to spearhead its efforts in the country. Carlyle Group is holding exploratory talks to build out a private credit business in India, people familiar with the matter had said.Varde Partners is expanding in India after deploying about $3 billion in private credit deals in the last five years, said Sandeep Chandak, senior managing director at the firm.Meanwhile, local firms True North Managers LLP, Kotak Investment Advisors Ltd. and Edelweiss Alternative Asset Advisors have set up private credit funds. Axis Bank Ltd. has begun pitching a $244 million credit fund to largely lend capital for acquisition financing, according to Salil Pitale, joint managing director and co-chief executive of Axis Capital.To be sure, competition is also putting pressure on lenders.“India is somewhat crowded,” SC Lowy co-founder Soo Cheon Lee said in a recent interview. “The country’s economy is doing fantastic, and because of that, borrowers are also becoming more demanding.”Private debt can be thought of as private equity’s cousin. It raises capital from investors, usually large institutions such as pension funds and insurers. While a private equity firm buys all or some of a company, private credit firms typically gain no ownership and just lend money to a company directly—putting themselves at the front of the line for repayment in a default.The size of private credit deals has steadily increased and this year, a few transactions crossed $1 billion, according to Indranil Ghosh, managing director at Cerberus’s India office. Cerberus is focused on special situations, real estate and non-performing loans within private credit.“We expect this trend to continue and eventually for private credit to be much larger than private equity in India, as is the case globally,” Ghosh said."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/after-raising-prices-sharply-corporate-profits-get-squeezed-as-inflation-eases-11044001.html,"After raising prices sharply, corporate profits get squeezed as inflation eases","July 27, 2023 06:24 PM IST","Consider Tesla, which reported not only stronger profit but also better revenue for the spring than analysts expected. Its stock nevertheless tumbled nearly 10% following the report, as some investors focused on its falling profit margins.","After enjoying a strong run where they could keep raising prices to boost their profits, companies are now stuck in a vice. On one end, revenue is under pressure as the global economy remains fragile. On the other, companies are having to pay higher wages for workers, among other costs.Caught in the middle are corporate profit margins, which measure how much profit companies make on each $1 of revenue.Consider Tesla, which reported not only stronger profit but also better revenue for the spring than analysts expected. Its stock nevertheless tumbled nearly 10% following the report, as some investors focused on its falling profit margins.The electric vehicle maker made an operating profit of $9.60 off every $100 in revenue from April through June. That was down from $11.40 three months earlier and from $14.60 a year earlier.Not only did Tesla cut prices on some of its models to drive sales, which pressured revenue, but it also had higher costs driven by projects like its Cybertruck and an artificial intelligence initiative.Altogether, companies in the S&P 500 likely earned $111 in net profit for every $1,000 in revenue during the spring, according to FactSet. That would be the weakest level since the end of 2020 when the economy was still coming out of the crater created by the coronavirus pandemic.The threat to the stock market is that margins could remain pressured. That would cap profits, which are already on track for a third straight quarter of year-over-year declines.Many analysts believe margins hit bottom in the second quarter, and they're forecasting a recovery in the second half. Others are less optimistic.Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, sees a risk of what she calls ""unsustainable margins"" leading to disappointment in the next six to nine months.Throughout history, there's been a pattern of analysts, investors and CEOs thinking the 'temporary pricing power' created by mismatches between high consumer inflation and input costs for companies are actually sustainable improvements in profit margins, according to Shalett.Strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute, meanwhile, point to high labour costs eating into profit margins in the second half. Average hourly earnings for workers were 4.4% higher in June than a year before. That was a bigger increase than the 3% for overall consumer price inflation, which can offer a crude look at how much companies are raising their prices.""We expect a squeeze on corporate margins if inflation stays high and an even larger squeeze if it falls,"" strategists at BlackRock Investment Institute said.If inflation were to fall, it would imply companies are having a tougher time raising prices for their customers and would dent revenue for companies. Or it could mean the economy is heading for a recession, which would also hurt revenue."

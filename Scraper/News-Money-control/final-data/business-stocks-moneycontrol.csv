(PPBL), an associate company of One97, on January 31, saying “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank” warranted the supervisory action. The RBI did not provide details of the concerns.One97 said its marketing and financial services business is not affected by the RBI’s directions towards PPBL. Its financial services such as loan distribution, insurance distribution and equity broking are not related to PPBL and are expected to be unaffected.According to Ved, the RBI wanted PPBL to operate at arm's length from the service provider and that did not happen.

After this, Paytm became the de facto platform for payments, said Ved.""While everyone in the private sector thought there was no money in UPI, Paytm gained a significant market share in UPI,"" said Ved, referring to the Unified Payments Interface, a platform that enables online fund transfers between bank accounts.Ved said Paytm was unique because it had a platform for customers and businesses and could cross-sell services between them.Paytm built a business of significant value and was on the path to profitability, said Ved. Even though the company has quantified the impact of the central bank's restriction, Ved was not sure how much time the company would take to claw back what it lost.Paytm said the regulatory measures are expected to have a worst-case impact of Rs 300-500 crore on its annual operational profit.There could also be strategic buyers for Paytm's payments business, said Ved.""I don't know whether Vijay Shekhar Sharma is willing to sell Paytm Payments Bank or not. There may be buyers. However, we have to see whether the existing founders are willing to sell stake or not. We also have to see whether the merger and acquisition is blessed by the regulator or not,"" he said.The central bank directed Paytm Payments Bank to stop accepting deposits or credit transactions or top-ups in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, and NCMC cards after February 29, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds.

The company hopes to gain market share in the category because consumers will prefer to buy a safer Godrej product over that of some unorganised player.","The stocks of Godrej Consumer Products Limited (GCPL) surged over 9 percent on February 1 after the company launched its Goodknight Agarbatti, India’s first, legal anti-mosquito incense sticks.The anti-mosquito incense sticks business is currently a Rs 1,200 crore market that’s crowded by unorganised players. These players bypass the regulations of the Central Insecticides Board (CIB) to create effective yet harmful products.GCPL plans to gain over 50 percent market share from the unorganised players. The Godrej incense stick is using a new molecule – Renofluthrin (RNF) — and GCPL has tied up with a manufacturer that will develop it for the company. RNF is considered twice as effective as other molecules used in home insecticides (HI) in India, says GCPL.Also read Cycle of local players entering market almost over, says HUL's Rohit JawaAnalysts said that the GCPL’s exclusive rights over RNF, along with a strong distribution system, will help the company gain market share in the anti-mosquito incense sticks category.“The new product has an extensive distribution network, which will enable it to make inroads into every nook and corner of the country, and its high-decibel advertising campaign will highlight its safety and efficacy compared to the unorganised trade,” said Vishal Gutka, Research Analyst, Phillip Capital.GCPL will be able to gain market share in the category because consumers will prefer to buy a safer GCPL product over that of some unorganised player, said Ajay Thakur, consumer staples analyst at Anand Rathi. ``Plus, Goodknight Agarbatti is available at a price point that’s similar to the competition’s: Rs 12 in north India, and Rs 10 in south India, enabling consumers to go for the safer product,’’ said Thakur.Home insecticides is a regulated market where companies have to have their formulation, or molecule, approved by the CIB before marketing their product. GCPL has registered RNF with the CIB and can use it in incense sticks.Companies spend several years formulating and testing a new molecule, before they can get the CIB’s approval. “Since unorganised sector players do not take the board’s approval, they dip the sticks in pesticides to make them more effective, which is very harmful,” said an analyst on condition of anonymity.This is not GCPL’s first try at anti-mosquito incense sticks. The company, in 2018, had forayed into this segment with agarbattis made of natural ingredients. However, that was a dud as natural ingredients like neem were ineffective against mosquitoes, said Thakur. The product was slowly phased out.Even though GCPL has a first-mover advantage in incense sticks, it won’t have much of a margin since the product is priced quite low, said analysts Moneycontrol spoke to. “GCPL will gain market share in the incense stick segment, however their margins in this will be lower than the company average,” said Gutka.GCPL can use RNF only in incense sticks now and awaits approval for high-margin products like liquid vaporisers and aerosol. GCPL has exclusive use of RNF medium term, after which the competition can also use the molecule, said Nitin Gupta, Senior Research Analyst, Emkay Financial Services. “From margin perspective, format approvals for liquid vaporiser and aerosol would be crucial,” said Gupta.Medium term is expected to be around 3-4 years say analysts.In an earlier report, Phillip Capital had said, “India continues to work with old molecules, which hampers the effectiveness of HI products, as mosquitoes keep evolving.” It added that the average weight of mosquitoes has more than doubled in the past couple of decades, making products with older molecules less effective. Thus, GCPL has a competitive edge over its competitors in the medium-term at least.The HI category contributes around 30-40 percent of GCPL's revenues. The company's sales have grown at a CAGR of 10 percent over the last three years, while its profit has grown at a CAGR of only 3 percent over the same period. GCPL's share price has increased 29 percent in the last one year, and 17 percent in the last six months.GCPL is expected to report a revenue of Rs 15,749 crore over FY24-25, as per ICICI Securities. It is expected to report a net profit of Rs 2,513 crore over the same period.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

They will fund a growing economy and will benefit from an overall revival of the banking system, according to Bagga","The Indian equity market may be poised for another rally before the general elections, even as the timeline for Fed rate cut gets pushed out to the second half of the year.In an interview to Moneycontrol, market expert Ajay Bagga shares his perspective on the unfolding Paytm saga amid the recent regulatory actions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) targeting payments banks that have sent ripples through the fintech ecosystem, prompting investors to re-evaluate their positions. Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the current market scenario and the likelihood of rate cuts from the Fed?The current market scenario is marked by anticipation surrounding both domestic and international factors. While earlier expectations included the possibility of multiple rate cuts from the Fed, recent developments, including a robust US economy and clear messaging from the Federal Reserve suggest a shift in expectations.The likelihood of rate cuts has diminished, with indications pointing towards no cuts until June or July. This adjustment in market sentiment, coupled with the upcoming elections, introduces a level of uncertainty regarding market movements.Despite this, I see the potential for one more rally before the elections, that could drive markets to new highs. But once the new government is formed, a lot will depend on the full-year budget in July and what happens around there.Should investors consider buying private sector banks amidst underperformance and liquidity issues?While private sector banks currently face challenges such as underperformance and liquidity issues, there are underlying factors that make them attractive long-term investment prospects. Despite short-term setbacks, private sector banks are a long-term buy as they will be the suppliers of capital into a growth economy. Additionally, improvements in the balance sheets of PSU banks suggest broader opportunities within the banking sector despite their recent run up. Remember, PSUs are playing catch up after a decade's underperformance. Recently, government said that PSU banks have earned Rs 98,000 crore as against Rs 70,000 crore last year. That's the kind of re-rating on the balance sheet for PSU banks. So banks will continue to do well.Also Read: What’s next for Paytm stock after 3% recovery? Don’t buy yet, if you don’t have huge risk appetiteWhat's your perspective on the recent regulatory actions targeting Paytm Payments Bank and its impact on the fintech ecosystem?The recent regulatory actions targeting payments banks reflect the importance of regulatory compliance within the fintech ecosystem.As a highly regulated sector, financial services require adherence to strict standards to safeguard consumer interests and maintain market stability. While the specific implications of these regulatory actions are still unfolding, it underscores the need for fintech companies to navigate regulatory frameworks effectively. RBI would not take such a big measure without understanding the implications. It is one of the best regulators in the world. If you remember,  five payment banks licences were surrendered by the promoters on their own out of the 11 that were given.The model itself is very difficult to make money on and, including say, a Vodafone and Pesa, which worked in East Africa, did not work in India. They gave back their licence. You can't really blame the regulator for this and we don't have enough information to make judgments. You know, the fintech guys are writing articles that RBI doesn't know the digital ecosystem. I don't think so.Also read: Paytm jumps 10% to hit upper circuit after large trade of sharesSo would you advise investors to stay away from the stock amid the ongoing regulatory scrutiny?Yes I would... I don't want to comment on the company. It might be a great company, might be run by great people but when there's so much noise around it, it's fair to presume that it may not end anytime soon. So get all the information and then take a call. Don't go by what FIIs or brokerages are doing, do your due diligence, gather more information and then take a call.Yes, maybe you missed this opportunity, no problem. Right now the problem is very big. RBI doesn't shut down banks, it asks other banks to take over. So, for the RBI to virtually shut down a bank there has to be a reason. Their decisions are well thought out and their big mandate is market stability. RBI will not make the market unstable.Also read: RBI may cancel licence of Paytm Payments BankThe start-up ecosystem in India is thriving despite risks because the country offers access to a vast consumer market, and presents lucrative opportunities for profit. Investors and stakeholders are drawn to this potential for financial gain rather than solely aiming to enhance our lives.Therefore, amidst concerns raised by private equity entities and vested interests about regulatory actions impacting the start-up ecosystem, it's essential to recognise the underlying motivations driving participation in the market: financial gain within a robust consumer landscape.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

In a report, the analysts have rejected positive outlook on the sector, citing concerns about near-term focus, profitability, and overlooking risks in the medium term, business models, and disruptions.PSU stocks surged 19-443 percent in the past year, led by capital goods, electric utilities, financials, and oil and gas. ""We find certain assumptions, surrounding the medium-to-long-term growth and profitability of these sectors, to be highly optimistic. We doubt much has changed in most sectors,"" the Kotak report said.PSUs in capital goods experienced a notable rerating on the back of increased order flow, but Kotak has warned of underestimated risks in assuming prolonged large order inflows, especially in sectors like thermal electricity generation. ""The government’s three-in-one role of buyer, owner and policymaker or regulator creates uncertainty regarding the companies’ future earnings and returns,"" it said.In electric utilities, Kotak notes a significant rerating, highlighting NTPC's valuation concerns and the market's overestimation of growth potential for PowerGrid. The transition to solar electricity and competitive tariff-based bidding projects pose risks, according to the analysts."" We are puzzled by the market’s confidence,"" Kotak wrote on the rally in state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs). In OMCs, the rerating was driven by high profitability assumptions, but Kotak has questioned market confidence, citing volatile marketing margins and optimistic profitability assumptions. ""The government pricing policy uncertainty and low FCF-to-PAT ratios make P/E-based valuations irrelevant,"" it said.Portfolio revisionKotak said it has added Pidilite Industries to its portfolio with a weight of 150 basis points while exiting PowerGrid Corp (190 bps). The brokerage house has redistributed the remaining 40 bps to SBI Life.PowerGrid Corp's robust performance, with a 69 percent return over the past year, is now trading at 2.4X FY2026 BV — a considerable premium compared to its fair multiple of around 1.5X BV. While historically viewed as a prime investment for India's electrification, current valuations seem to be reflecting the anticipated growth opportunities for the next few years, it said.The brokerage house is reassured by Pidilite's strong earnings visibility in the thriving residential real estate up-cycle, expecting it to continue for the next few years. Pidilite's solid market position and potential weakening competition are factors contributing to this confidence. The company's profitability, despite recent price cuts and increased advertising and promotion spending, is considered comfortable.Additionally, Pidilite's low risk of disruption sets it apart from other building materials products. Adhesives, a key product, are likely to remain B2C, unlike other building products that may transition to B2B as development trends shift towards larger projects by major developers, Kotak said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

But 'buy' recommendations decreased from 25 to 22, while 'hold' and 'sell' calls rose to 5 and 7 from 4 and 5, respectively. The overall sentiment towards the stock remains positive on the Street, characterised by a mood of 'cautious optimism'.Bharat Petroleum's Q3 results fell below analyst estimates on lower gross refining margin (GRM) and weaker marketing margin. Despite a record H1, the Q3 profits declined. Its Q3 refining throughput rose 5 percent on-quarter to 9.9 mmt, with reported GRM at $13.4/bbl, surpassing estimates.While Singapore GRM averages $6.5 per barrel, long-term sustainability is uncertain. Analysts project BPCL's GRM at $13.1/6/6/bbl for FY24/25/26. Mumbai/Bina/Kochi GRMs missed by 39.3 percent/25.7 percent/23.6 percent. The PAT beat is attributed to a 51 percent surge in other income/lower interest cost, despite a marketing inventory loss of Rs 369 crore, according to a Nirmal Bang report.BPCL's implied marketing margin contracted from Rs 7 a litre in 2Q to Rs 4.2 in 3Q, impacted by lower diesel margins and inventory loss. Interest costs dropped significantly QoQ, but higher depreciation and lower other income offset the reduction. The completion of refinery upgrades in Mumbai and Kochi and plans for petrochemical and renewable energy projects at Bina have been announced.According to JP Morgan, despite historical trading at a premium due to better ROE and asset quality management BPCL's valuation premium against IOCL and HPCL may remain limited due to IOCL's aggressive petrochemical expansions.Analysts said retail margin upside is restricted by periodic pricing constraints influenced by political considerations, potentially offsetting analysts' forecasted oil price declines. Clarity on the rights issue timeline, pricing, size, and other details, targeted for completion in FY24, is eagerly awaited by analysts.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

He warned them not to have another ‘Yes Bank scenario’.It could be considered as an investment choice for sophisticated investors who can track the communications coming out of both the RBI and PayTM and understand, interpret and infer appropriately from those communications, he said.If Paytm could successfully migrate the wallet business to other banks, it could keep most of the wallet customers without huge customer loss and it won’t have a long-term impact on the company, according to Gupta.Paytm outlook uncertain; valuation attractive, but things could get worse tooBut, what about investors who already own Paytm stock? “People who already have Paytm in their portfolio need not panic and book loss now, because it is trading at juicy valuations, assuming that the overall business comes back to the original levels, albeit in partnership with other banks,” he explained.Gupta added that things could get even worse for Paytm. It could be suitable only for investors who put a limited proportion of their portfolio into the stock, and who have a good risk appetite.Meanwhile, Bernstein has given an outperform call on Paytm with target price of Rs 600 as they expect the company to “successfully execute operational changes required to overcome restrictions”.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The brokerage believes these refiners are seeing multiples re-rate as investors reassess long-term growth prospects. Morgan Stanley pointed out four key factors driving the re-rating.Among the reasons propelling re-rating in these stocks, Morgan Stanley said that India remains the fastest-growing market globally for fuel demand with improved clarity on global fuel demand over the medium term as internal combustion engine vehicle demand remains strong. It also said that hardware upgrades by refiners prior to COVID 19 are now being reflected in earnings as the energy market becomes less volatile. Besides, the SOE reforms, which led to re-ratings in countries like China, Singapore and Korea, are now being reflected in India as well. ""Stocks of these oil refining and marketing companies  are seeing multiples re-rate as investors reassess long-term growth prospects,"" said the brokerage in its report. Morgan expects both earning upgrades as well as re-rating in these stocks with multiples rising to levels seen in 2014-2o017, said the report.For Reliance Industries, the report said its NAV is starting to reflect energy upside. “In our view, RIL’s implied refinery multiples have re-rated by around 10 percent since last quarter. While there is also an element of the investment cycle being unwound, a large part is driven by the fuel business. Improving refining margins and their impact on deleveraging, along with clarity on margins due to limited windfall taxes on exports, are all falling in line,"" the report added.Morgan Stanley believes the re-rating will be followed by an earnings upgrade cycle. Over the past six months, HPCL has run up more than 100 percent, IOC 99 percent, and BPCL has risen 69 percent.Over the past month alone, IOC has run up 39 percent while HPCL has surged 24 percent, and BPCL has also gained 34 percent.In terms of valuations, Morgan Stanley noted that ""IOCL trades at one year forward P/BV of 1.2x, 19 per cent below +1 standard deviation; BPCL trades at one year forward P/BV of 1.5x, near historical averages; and HPCL trades at one year forward P/BV of 1.5x, near +1SD,"" said Morgan Stanley."

Buying traction remained in the metal segment, while both Bank Nifty and PSU banking indices experienced a round of correction.On the daily chart, the index has formed a bullish candle with the downside being protected at 21,700. To resume its primary uptrend, the index has to breach the hurdle of 22,100.Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP ParibasOn the daily charts we can see that the Nifty has been broadly trading within the range in an upward sloping channel. Until the recent swing low of 21,730 not breached, we can expect the upmove to continue towards 22,000 – 22,130.The daily and the hourly momentum indicators have a positive crossover, which is a a buy signal. Both price and momentum indicators are suggesting continuation of the positive momentum, however, considering the recent sharp reversals from the upper boundary (22,000) one needs to be cautious on the long side.Stock-specific action and sector rotation are likely to continue during this period of consolidation. Key support levels are 21,730–21,700 while immediate hurdle is at 22,100 - 22,130.Bank Nifty closed in the negative but the index seems to be oversold. The positive crossover on the hourly time frame suggests that the Bank Nifty is poised for a pullback after the recent correction. On the upside, we expect Bank Nifty to retrace till 46,500–46,800. Crucial support is at 45,370.Osho Krishan, Sr Analyst-Technical and Derivative Research, Angel OneThe broad-based buying traction levitated the undertone, which was seen in the technical chart structure for the Nifty. Amid a favourable sentiment, the index managed to maintain a positive stature and settled the day a tad above 21,900, procuring 0.72 percent to bull’s kitty.Technically, there has been insignificant development with minor alterations on a broader view of the index. However, sectoral rotation is evident, keeping the play in the market.The chart structure points to range-bound activity, with a strong nearby resistance at the 22,000 followed by 22,100. Only a decisive breakthrough can trigger the next leg of rally. Intermediate support is at 21,800-21,750, while the 20-DEMA placed around 21,650 is the sacrosanct support zone for the comparable period.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Therefore, approvals are sought for 9.99 percent, the maximum limit.Despite the perceived intent, it does not mean that full 9.99 percent stake will be acquired. Since it does not make sense to seek RBI approval for every 1-2 percent stake, companies tend to ask for the maximum 9.99 percent.How much does the HDFC group currently hold in these banks?At the end of the December quarter, it held 3.43 percent in ICICI Bank, 2.57 percent in Axis Bank, 4.48 percent in IndusInd Bank and 3 percent in Yes Bank.Why is RBI approval needed?The RBI's approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector, said Vijay Singh Gour, lead analyst, Choice Broking.Also Read: China's market restrictions won't help, may be bad for EMs, no immediate impact on IndiaWhat is the validity of the approval?The approval is valid for a year and if HDFC fails to acquire the shareholding within that period, the approval stands cancelled.If the holding stands at sub-5 percent before the year-end, then RBI’s approval will be required again to increase it to 5 percent or more.Is this sign of merger?No. It is simply an approval for investment purpose, clarified Jignesh Shial of Incred Equities.Other examples...LIC on January 24 received the RBI's approval to acquire up to 9.99 percent in HDFC Bank. In December 2023, ICICI Prudential AMC got RBI nod to acquire 9.99 percent in Federal Bank.In October 2023, HDFC AMC got the RBI’s go-ahead to acquire 9.5 percent in DCB Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, The Federal Bank, Karur Vysya Bank and City Union Bank.Also Read: Credit growth to moderate to 13%; Paytm and lower-rated NBFCs at risk: Macquarie’s Suresh GanapathyAny instances where RBI approval has lapsed before a 9.9 percent stake acquisition?Yes. In November 2021, LIC got approval to hike stake in Kotak Mahindra Bank to up to 9.9 percent. A year later, its stake in the lender had gone up to 6.25 percent from 4.96 percent.In May 2023, SBI MF received similar approval for HDFC Bank. Three months to go for the validity to lapse and SBI MF holds about 5.57 percent stake in the bank.What does it mean for the six stocks?It is a sentimentally positive news, said Nitin Aggarwal, head–BFSI research, institutional equities, Motilal Oswal Financial Services. “Flows should come in over the medium term,"" he said.What do back-to-back RBI approvals indicate?Domestic institutions, including LIC, are eyeing to increase stake in private banks. Since October 2023, domestic institutions have created over Rs 1.4 lakh crore headroom to buy stakes.With the general election unlikely to throw a surprise and expectations of private capex picking up, domestic institutions are waiting on the sidelines to hike stakes in banks and financials.Banking stocks are seen as a reasonably valued bets at a time when the market sits on high valuations, analysts said."

The proportionate weight of Banking and Financial Services shares in Nifty is fallen to 33% as per the latest factsheet from National Stock Exchange, as compared to a 38.45% weightage in April 2023. This is a significant fall of 5.45% in the weightage of banking in the index.Private sector banking shares are the biggest drag in the weightage, with Nifty heavyweights like HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank and IndusInd Bank all of them correcting sharply in the past few weeks.Shares of HDFC Bank have taken the biggest knock this year, correcting 15.5% to be the worst performing stock on the Nifty in 2024, after UPL. India's largest private bank had registered its biggest single day drop since March 2020, a day after its Q3FY24 results. The bank had reported a miss in net interest margins (NIM) in Q3FY24 due to higher cost of funds. Higher provisions and decade low earnings per share (EPS) growth also added to the decline.This weakness in HDFC Bank has rubbed off on the Nifty Bank Index as well, which is down about 5% this year.In fact, the sentiment for private sector banking shares has soured so much this year that all the constituents of Nifty Bank index except ICICI Bank are trading with losses for the year.What made matters worse was the third quarter net profit of India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) missing street estimates earlier this month, with the bank provisioning for more funds for pension liabilities."

The regulator has already ordered the bank to halt much of its business, potentially affecting the broader digital-payments pioneer’s prospects.Paytm said the company and its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma aren’t under investigation by the country’s anti-money laundering agency, although the statements did little to alleviate investor concerns. Paytm shares tumbled 10% Monday, pushing its declines over the past three trading days to more than 40%.“In the past, certain merchants/users on our platforms have been subject to enquiries and on those occasions, we have always cooperated with the authorities,” Paytm parent One97 Communications Ltd. said in a disclosure to stock exchanges late Sunday. The company has also cooperated with state agencies on such probes, it added.The unprofitable company’s market value has tumbled to about $3.4 billion — down about 80% from its stock market debut in late 2021. The Mumbai stock exchange over the weekend changed the daily move limit on Paytm shares to 10% after it plunged by 20% — the previous limit —  on each Thursday and Friday.India’s regulator stepping up its actions on Paytm’s relatively small banking arm is a blow to the broader firm’s reputation and means it needs to quickly find new partners to soften the impact to its core digital-payments business.Sharma owns 51% in the payments bank, which can take deposits of up to 200,000 rupees ($2,412) but isn’t allowed to lend. One97 Communications owns the remaining stake.The Reserve Bank of India on Jan. 31 issued an order that bars Paytm Payments Bank from taking deposits or allowing top-ups after Feb 29. The banking regulator is considering scrapping the bank’s license as early as March.SoftBank Group Corp.-backed Paytm has been in the cross-hairs of the regulator for some time, with multiple warnings over the past two years about questionable dealings between its banking arm and its popular payments app.In a response to the regulator’s latest salvo, Paytm last week said it will expand its relationships with third-party banks to expand its business and work toward profitability. It also addressed what it called “market rumors,” saying Sharma “has not taken any margin loans, or otherwise pledged any shares that are directly or indirectly owned by him.”"

But there is a twist in the tale,"February 05, 2024 11:05 AM IST","Several brokerages, including Motilal Oswal, Jefferies and Nomura, have a “buy” call on SBI stock. JP Morgan and Bernstein have an “overweight” call on the counter.","State Bank of India (SBI) has failed to live up to the projections made by the Street with its Q3 net profit being battered down by a hefty wage and pension bill. The state-run lender's overall earnings, however, remained healthy, driven by lower credit costs, despite weak core operating performance, which attracted bullish calls from brokerages. Analysts believe that SBI is well-placed amid tight liquidity.For the quarter ended December 2023, the bank's net profit fell 35 percent on-year to Rs 9,163 crore under Rs 7,100-crore pension liabilities. The net interest income (NII) of the country's largest bank came in at Rs 39,815 crore, missing estimates of Rs 40,304 crore.According to analysts at Noumra, despite soft NIM and significant one-off expenses in Q3FY24, SBI demonstrated robust loan growth, although NIM fell short of expectations.""The bank is positioned well within the current tight liquidity environment,"" it said, adding that SBI's operational expenses were managed effectively, excluding the impact of elevated provisions for wage revisions.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionWhile the brokerage has put a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 755 per share, it has adjusted its FY24 EPS estimate downward by 13 percent.SBI's asset quality remained robust in the quarter under review, with net slippage at just 0.4 percent.JP Morgan noted that despite a 12-bps sequential decrease in core NIMs due to deposit repricing, SBI's credit costs were lower, with core loan losses offset against account level upgrades.Looking ahead, the brokerage believes that Q4 is expected to see another wage revision hike, while FY25 stands to benefit from a moderation in wage costs, driving up the operating leverage. It has an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 725 per share.Jefferies also has a 'buy' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 810 per share. The public sector lender's NIMs were effectively managed, contributing to NII growth, while loan growth improved to 14 percent, primarily driven by corporate loans, the brokerage noted. The unsecured retail segment shows signs of normalisation downward, it said.""Despite concerns, asset quality is performing better than estimated. With a CET-1 ratio of 10.4 percent, there's a limited buffer, but high return on equity (RoE) and marked-to-margin (MTM) gains may provide support. However, the potential for a near-term capital raise remains an overhang,"" Jefferies said in a report.Note that the CET-1 ratio compares a bank's capital against its risk-weighted assets to determine its ability to withstand financial distress. International firm Bernstein also has an 'Outperform' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 710 per share.Also Read | SBI Q3 results: Net profit plummets 35% to Rs 9,163 crore, asset quality healthyAccording to Motilal Oswal, SBI has various levers such as cash deposit (CD) ratio and marginal cost of the fund-based lending rate (MCLR) repricing to keep margins stable.SBI's business growth remains robust, with signs of a recovery in the corporate segment, the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 800.Analysts at JM Financial Services believe delivery of growth on guided lines, sustenance of NIMs near current levels and controlled asset quality parameters aiding controlled credit costs should lead to strong profitability going ahead.""We value the core banking business at 1.2x FY26 P/BV and arrive at our SoTP-based target price of Rs 800 per share,"" the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock.At 9:43am, the SBI shares traded flat at Rs 651.70 a piece on the NSE.

He is the founder and director of Ayan Analytics which has developed ZodiacAnalyst. It is a research software, with time and price charting tools, and it is exclusively used along with technical support.Last week, equity markets witnessed a volatile price movement in many stocks. As expected, a few stocks got hammered. Paytm and L&T were prominent among the beaten down stocks. As per TimeMap, the energy sector kept up the bullish sentiment, and many counters still look undervalued. Banks, NBFCs, and insurance sectors are not bullish but attractive as low-risk bottom fishing bets.We are not surprised by the volatility, as TimeMap was showing 50:50 equal weight to bullish and bearish traders, and our opinion was slightly stock-specific bearish and best for speculative trades. While the recovery is surprisingly strong, even the follow-up buying seen in the energy sector is somewhat scary. We always accept the fact as it is.Technical: We have advised part profit-booking and exposure rebalancing to reduce portfolio beta, as charts have given the first confirmation of 20,450 within 30 days. Critical levels on the Nifty charts are 21,290 and 20,870; last week’s Nifty movement created a decisive exit point for the leveraged positions, which is 21,100.Also Read: Primary market action: 5 IPOs opening for subscription, with 6 listings scheduled next weekWeekly charts will turn negative at 20,870, opening another downside target of 20,100. Currently hold 7-10 percent cash in the portfolio, as on the upside, 22,390 seems an extremely tough zone to cross.Looking at various AI models and TimeMaps, unabated selling can get triggered around 22,390 and 20,870. Once the sale begins, the stop limit would be 550 to 600 points.Bank Nifty is showing low risk better reward status at the current moment.Energy and PSE sectors are positive, but will surely consolidate at the current levels, so the momentum will ease and remained stable.TimeMap: As mentioned, there is ongoing targeted wealth reduction. The upcoming week indicates that the bullish trend still has considerable momentum. Despite significant wealth depletion, the repercussions will persist, and we recommend adopting a more prudent approach for greater sensibility. In the coming week, aspects of Mercury 0 Pluto have historically given wealth destruction due to natural disasters.Institutional investors fund flow toward the FMCG, metal, and PSE still show strength, and there is a long way to go. The best day of the week for the bulls is the 7 February, aspect of Uranus 120 Venus, which significantly boosts the price of OIL companies, in the energy sector. The Mars 60 Neptune is suitable for research companies in every field. We are becoming more sceptical towards the markets.Also Read: Paytm denies facing ED probe amid RBI action against banking armStandalone Mercury is entering sign Capricorn, which is bad for the traders; the next 25 days might not prove suitable for the traders, and most will suddenly start witnessing weekly negative P&L (profit & loss).

Comparatively, it would be a boring day. Activity in some stocks would drop, especially the small and midcaps.

STBT is selectively recommended with 72 hours of trade life.February 08, 2024: Thursday: K.13: U.Shadha: Bad dayA negative opening of indices is expected. After 11 am, a slow and steady recovery in many stocks would increase hopes of the perennial bulls. Post 14.15, we expect a piece of external news or influence to shake the bulls' confidence, and many might exit from the long positions; unwinding can trigger a wave of a sell-off in the markets. In case of of sell-off BTST is highly recommended.February 09, 2024; Friday: K.14: Shravan: Bullish dayMarket opening would be sluggish, and slow start would refrain most participants entering the positions, lower volumes trigger price volatility. Market intelligence of news flow would give the best trades, do look forward to big deals and large volumes and participate with them.Overall while markets will remain stable and nominal negative weekly close is expected. In our opinion looking at the market TimeMap, looks like market breadth would be negative and midcap and small cap would see lot of outflows."

The Rest of the World market grew 12 percent on year.Continued pressure on pricing, higher discounts and forex losses led to a sharp erosion in the EBITDA margin to 4.21 percent the third quarter against 22.2 percent in the year-ago period.Going by the weak demand environment, the company expects pressure to persist in the next January-March period as well and now see business normalising from the second quarter of FY25 instead of the earlier H2 of FY24.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionDisappointed by the company's Q3 numbers, DAM Capital downgraded its rating for the stock to “sell”, with a price target of Rs 462.Jefferies reduced its price target on UPL to Rs 635 to factor in the weak Q3 numbers but retained its “buy” call.

This rally can continue over the coming days,"" says Milan Vaishnav, CMT, MSTA, founder of Gemstone Equity Research & Advisory Services.But, in case of Tata Motors, the current structure of the chart shows that the stock may consolidate for some time before moving higher, he feels.Among sectors, the Nifty CPSE index is overbought but it is in a strong uptrend, while the oil and gas space is also in a strong uptrend. ""With no signs of any impending reversal on charts, it would be fair to conclude that this uptrend may continue with intermittent consolidation on the chart in the oil and gas space,"" the technical expert with nearly two decades spent in the capital markets says in an interview to Moneycontrol. Excerpts:Do you think the Nifty 50 is done with the rally for the near term, considering the chart patterns? What is the possibility of another 10 percent rally from here on before the elections?I would look at the Nifty from a different perspective. From a technical standpoint, the index tested the current levels of 21,800-21,850 in the last week of December. Now, apart from marking an incremental high at 22,124 recently, it remains at the same level at which it was in the last week of December.Over the past many weeks, the Index is in a defined trading range of 21,100-21,900 and it is likely to stay in this range.Two things I see are - there is very little to no possibility of a 10 percent up-move in the Nifty from the current levels until the general elections; and the second thing is that any incremental up-move will come in (not 10 percent, of course) only if the index is able to cross and stay above 22,000 levels.Do you think the State Bank of India has formed double top pattern on all major timeframes? Does it mean there will be sharp cut in the stock price?Yes, but only on the daily timeframe. SBI has formed a double-top pattern with resistance at Rs 659. This implies that for any further up-move to take place, SBI will have to cross and stay above the Rs 659 levels.This also means that this level can act as a resistance. It does not imply that double-tops result in any sharp cut in the price. They just create resistance.Do you expect Tata Motors to hit Rs 1,000 mark in the coming weeks?It is difficult to say. Tata Motors is in a strong ongoing uptrend, any move above the recent high of Rs 900 can take it higher. The current structure of the chart shows that the stock may consolidate for some time before moving higher.I also expect the stock rotation to take place within the Auto Index with other laggards which are otherwise good stocks like Maruti Suzuki, Ashok Leyland, etc. start doing well.Do you see the rally continuing in InterGlobe Aviation that gained throughout last week?Yes, IndiGo has staged a breakout by crossing above Rs 3,000 level. This rally can continue over the coming days.Where do you see the best trading strategy among the Nifty 50, Bank Nifty, Fin Nifty or Nifty IT, for next week?I expect Nifty and Bank Nifty to oscillate back and forth in a defined trading range. I expect these indices to stay devoid of any definite directional bias and I also expect volatility to stay at elevated levels.A trending move in the upside in Nifty and Bank Nifty can be expected only after these indices cross and stay above 22,000 and 46,700 levels, respectively.So far as the Nifty IT Index is concerned, it is a strong uptrend; I expect this upmove to extend in the coming week.Do you see a Tweezer Top in the Nifty Auto index? Does it mean there would be correction in the coming week?Yes, you can call the current formation on the daily chart a Tweezer Top. However, this may not necessarily imply a correction. However, this has the potential to stall the current rally and cause the Auto index to consolidate.It is important to note that no candle should ever be traded in isolation; one must always look out for confirmation on the next bar and consider the overall technical setup.Do you think the Nifty CPSE index is looking overbought?Yes, it is overbought but it is also in a strong uptrend. Being overbought itself is a sign of a robust uptrend in force.Do you see more steam left in oil & gas stocks?Just like the Nifty CPSE index, the oil and gas space is also in a strong uptrend. With no signs of any impending reversal on charts, it would be fair to conclude that this uptrend may continue with intermittent consolidation on the chart.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The stock remained above all key moving averages which is a positive sign.,"With the formation of a 'shooting star' as well as a 'double top' kind of patterns formation on the daily charts, which indicate bearish reversal trends, experts turned cautious and now anticipate some consolidation with a negative bias in the upcoming sessions.If the index decisively breaks the low of Friday at 21,805, then there will be confirmation to the chart patterns and the index may see some corrections, but in case the index manages to hold the low, then the move towards record high can't be ruled out, experts said.On February 2, the benchmark indices closed off the day's high due to correction in the later part of the session.

Since the past couple of months the stock has witnessed rising volumes which suggests buying force along with price rise.With this price hike, the stock has also decisively broken previous swing high and registered a new high at Rs 572 levels indicating bullish sentiments. The daily and monthly ""Bollinger band"" buy signal suggests increased momentum.The stock is well placed above its 20, 50, 100 and 200 day SMA (simple moving average) and these averages are inching up along with rising prices which reconfirms bullish trend.Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 585-685, with downside support zone of Rs 515-500 levels.Jindal Steel & PowerWith last week's 8 percent gains, the stock has decisively broken out its past 6-7 weeks' consolidation range (Rs 760-Rs 690) on a closing basis. This breakout is accompanied with huge volumes indicating increased participation.Recently the stock has recaptured its 20, 50 and 100 day SMA and rebounded very sharply which supports bullish sentiments. The weekly price action has confirmed ""Cup & Handle"" formation breakout at Rs 760 levels on a closing basis.The stock is in strong uptrend across all the times forming a series of higher tops and bottoms. The daily, weekly and monthly strength indicator RSI (relative strength index) is in positive terrain which shows sustained strength.Investors should buy, hold and accumulate this stock with an expected upside of Rs 825-885, with downside support zone of Rs 745-730 levels.Can Fin HomesSince the past 8-9 months, the stock was consolidating within Rs 825-710 levels, however with last week's gain the stock is poised at the upper band of consolidation range.

Pricewise, it may seem that bulls had an upper hand through the eventful week ended February 2, however, Friday's notable profit-booking in the latter half indicates some uncertainty at higher levels.Examining Friday's candle, we can see a formation that resembles a 'shooting star' pattern at a new all-time high. This has a negative implication once prices start trading below the low of the candle i.e. 21,805 and certainly casts doubt on bullish prospects. Although the prices seem rangebound, caution is advised for traders due to a complete nosedive in financial space, which proves to be a spoilsport once again.Traders are advised to avoid complacent long bets and ideally, any bounce towards 22,000 - 22,100 should be considered to exit long positions. The primary up-trend will resume only once the Nifty closes above 22,100 comfortably.Conversely, immediate support is seen at 21,650, followed by 21,430, with a breach potentially triggering further weakness in the near term.Here is one buy call and one sell call for short term:Latent View Analytics: Buy | LTP: Rs 485.45 | Stop-Loss: Rs 459.80 | Target: Rs 528 | Return: 9 percentThe entire IT space, especially the midcap basket, has done phenomenally well over the past few months; but this stock is yet to prove its mettle. All this while, the stock prices have been trading in higher highs, higher lows formation, but the momentum has been lacking.We can see a series of consolidation phases following any short burst move. Now on Friday, we have observed a similar breakout potential move, but this time it’s backed by consistent volumes.Hence, we expect the stock to now catch up with some of its peer counters. We recommend buying on a decline up to Rs 480 for a trading target of Rs 528. The stop-loss can be placed at Rs 459.80.Jubilant Foodworks: Sell | LTP: Rs 494.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 512 | Target: Rs 474 | Return: 4 percentThis one of the largest food service companies has been on a declining mode since the fag end of the December month. In this process, it has not only breached key price swings but also sneaked below the key moving averages like ’89-day EMA’ (exponential moving average) and ‘200-day SMA’ (simple moving average).In addition, the ‘RSI-Smoothened’ oscillator has dipped below the 15 mark, indicating significant underperformance of the prices. Since there is no respite for this corrective move, we expect further decline in the coming days.We recommend selling around Rs 498 for a near-term target of Rs 474. The strict stop-loss needs to be placed at Rs 512.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, if there is a significant cut, the markets may not be able to sustain at the lower levels.","By Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand RathiJanuary 2024 turned out to be a roller-coaster month but ended on very flat note with no major catalysts. Too many things happened during the month that were broadly in line with our expectations. To begin with, we mentioned our red flag zone of 22,000-22,400 for the Nifty benchmark index. At the start of the month, the index touched a new high of 22,100, after which it corrected till 21,100, which is nearly 1,000 points from its high. On the other hand, the expected level of 21,000 served as a strong support level, after which we saw a recovery to the level of 21,700.According to the derivative data, the Nifty index turned from the level of 22,100 where the FII long short ratio of index futures reached the level of 70 percent. Then, there was a correction, and this data went down to the level of 20 percent. In general, this zone is seen as the oversold zone, and then the markets recovered. Therefore, based on the data (now again near 30 percent), we don't anticipate any major cracks in the market. However, if there is a significant cut, the markets may not be able to sustain at the lower levels.On the technical side, the new high of Nifty is a Double Top, and a close above the level of 22,126 in February month could trigger a fresh round of rally. Therefore, investors and traders can only make aggressive bets above the same level. On the downside, 21,500 could be a zone of staggered buying next week.Meanwhile, the Nifty Bank index was the biggest party spoiler in the market. The index not only outperformed the benchmark, but ended January 2024 with a cut of around 5 percent. As a result, the index retested its 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average), which was near 44,400. So 44,400 looks like the last hope for the bulls for the coming weeks. Weekly closings below the same can cause further panic.In the short-term, 45,000 could be a major support and if it does get support at the same, we might witness some recovery in the index. Overall, close above 47,000 can take Bank Nifty to 50,000 in the coming months..Here are three buy calls for short term:Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 180 | Stop-Loss: Rs 155 | Target: Rs 215 | Return: 19 percentSince the last 2 months or so, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Recently, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative. Having said that, it has also formed a bullish Gartley pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable. Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines.The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars, which indicates bullish bias in the counter. On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has given a trendline violation, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter.Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 172-182 with an upside target of Rs 215, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 155 on a daily close basis.Note: The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, which help traders, identify reaction highs and lowsPetronet LNG: Buy | LTP: Rs 269 | Stop-Loss: Rs 235 | Target: Rs 320 | Return: 19 percentSince 2019 until 2023, Rs 240 levels have proved to be massive resistance. Fortunately, in January 2024, the said counter managed to clear its Rs 240 resistance very comfortably and is currently placed near Rs 270 zone. The breakout on the monthly chart looks genuine since it is accompanied by huge volume, with respective stochastics reversing from the 40 zone, which is looking lucrative at current levels.Thus, investors and traders can enter longs in the zone of Rs 260–272 with an upside target of Rs 320 and a stop-loss of Rs 235 on a daily closing basis.KPR Mill: Buy | LTP: Rs 790 | Stop-Loss: Rs 749 | Target: Rs 860 | Return: 9 percentAfter making the top near Rs 928 on December 22, 2023, the said counter gave a decent correction until Rs 732. In the previous trading session, it bounced back from the support zone of Rs 730, coincidentally, which is between 100 and 200 DEMA, and in the process, it also took out its bearish trendline, thus making it attractive at current levels.On the indicator front, daily stochastics has given a bull divergence, which further confirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 780–795 with an upside target of Rs 860 and stop-loss orders would be placed on a daily closing basis around Rs 749.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Improved asset quality-led lowering of credit cost appears to be an outcome of some structural improvement owing to Company’s better underwriting and collections along with macro tailwinds benefiting the lenders. The management sounded reasonably confident about most targets of “Mission 2025”, except the 2.5% RoA.OutlookIn our view, MMFS’s strong Q3 performance signals a sustained improvement in profitability over coming quarters; however, it is unlikely that FY25E RoA will hit 2%.

Edited excerpts:What are your first reactions to the Budget?I am delighted to see the fiscal consolidation. It's remarkable to see this sort of fiscal consolidation in an election year. Given that this is the year India is making its debut in the global bond markets, it'll bring down the ten-year bond yield, it will strengthen the rupee, and it will embellish India's credentials as a market. So I was expecting a 5.2 percent fiscal deficit target for FY25 but the FM has said 5.1 percent. The FM has pulled back the capex to 11 percent.The focus on energy transition was also interesting which had EV charging stations, rooftop solar, and EV buses at the state government level. After the elections, we will hear plenty more on EVs. The government has also been moving ahead with the affordable housing theme. It looks like they’re going to keep on re-emphasising the housing theme. We have invested plenty in the building materials and housing space. We've begun our investments in energy transition, so hopefully, by the time she spells out the details after the elections, we will have made more investments there.What do you think about the 5.1 percent fiscal deficit target?If she is able to deliver the Rs 45 trillion spending figure and keep it at or below that number then I think 5.1 percent is very doable.Did you see anything in the Budget that could trigger consumption?The Finance Minister was very clear that the government would not want to give entitlements to the poor. Over the four years, the National Democratic Alliance was very clear about not giving handouts and sops but rather giving direct benefit transfer where it is required. They want to drive consumption through job creation via EV charging stations. She seemed to suggest that there would be announcements which would make it easier for entrepreneurs to start EV charging stations. Also make financing easier through PSUs and quasi-governmental organisations. Nothing in the Budget suggested that there would be helicopter dropping of cash. The Budget seemed more about giving direct benefit transfer wherever it was necessary. And after that designing schemes for job creation.What are the direct plays from the Budget?The Finance Minister was talking about middle-class housing, which means there will be encouragement given to build and buy housing. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY) Grameen, 2 crore more dwellings are to be created over five years. So, the entire building material space with affordable housing financiers will become relevant. Over the last year, mainstream mortgage finance has grown 25 percent while affordable housing finance has only grown at 15 percent. This will reverse after the elections if the Finance Minister’s scheme has legs in it.I meet auto rickshaw drivers, vegetable store owners, barbers, and rickshaw pullers who are buying houses using PMAY. We have Aavas Financiers as our main investment. Affordable housing using PMAY will become a defining theme in the years ahead.In energy transition, we've invested in Eicher Motors because of Volvo. Volvo was steadily gaining market share and has also set up a new plant in Madhya Pradesh. A lot of auto ancillaries will become interesting because they will supply to Indian auto OEMs as well as global OEMs with EV parts. The more support the government gives to the energy transition now, the more benefits we get in the years ahead.The government is focusing on the women empowerment theme because there are more women voters now. The women theme will also become a big theme.Would you bet on any developers?Investing in real estate in India is tricky because of the lack of barriers to entry. Even in the middle of this crazy boom in real estate, developers are not making money. The reason they don’t make money in terms of cash flows is that there are dozens of developers in a location pursuing the same customer. The customer obviously benefits.What about solar? Does it look like a theme to you?The silicon rooftop solar will potentially become a very interesting theme. It's almost similar to building materials. We haven't spotted any of them in the stock market yet but I think if there's a big scheme around rooftop solar, given that much of the country is dredged in sunshine this looks like a potential theme. I’m sure private equity investors are looking at making rooftop solar investments which will get listed in the next two-three years.How does the market look this year?The situation in the Middle East is tricky. It is not something where Washington DC can call up a government and negotiate with them. These are basically wild people who are hijacking ships, and setting drones with missiles on them. So you are dealing with supranational terrorists who are blocking the most critical freight route in the world. I don’t have a clear answer. But if the Middle Eastern situation calms down, I'm sure bond deals and inflationary pressures will come off and equities rally further.The second thing to look out for is when the Federal Reserve will cut rates. If rate cuts come by the middle of the year then it makes it easy for the RBI to cut rates. Another thing to watch out for is whether India will fill the void created by China’s decline. In the July Budget there will be more tangible steps like PLI and FAME, which will allow India to step into the void created by China's decline. The fairy-tale situation for us would be if by Diwali the Middle-east has quietened, crude prices are at $70 per barrel, the Federal Reserve has started cutting, and China’s property issues continue. This combination is powerful for the stock markets.What do you expect in the next Budget that was missed this time?There will be announcements on taxes and disinvestments. In the five-year cycle, the NDA will try to push disinvestments. There will also be trade treaties with the UK and Switzerland.What are your top three themes for the next six months to a year?I would say the big transition. The FM had alluded to it in her speech also. Public sector capex has gone up around 30 to 35 percent in the last three Budgets. She is now saying that it is time the baton is passed on to the private sector. We at Marcellus are trying our best to identify private-sector capex plays. So far, we've made investments in Shanti Gears, RHI Magnesita and SKF. Second is the whole focus on Nari Shakti. There's a massive constituency that is aspirational, well educated, increasingly finding income and employment, and will be logical for the politicians to cater to that. So far, we have identified Trent and Rainbow Medicare. We're looking for more such plays. If you were to think about it, Nykaa, Mamaearth, etc, are women-focused businesses. I just wish they made a little bit more money and made it easier for us to invest. What's very interesting is that many of the needs of women are being intuited and catered to better by women entrepreneurs than by male entrepreneurs. And we're certainly looking forward to finding more such companies.The third theme is energy transition. The quicker we transition to EVs, the better. And if our EV ecosystem is efficient enough to become an exporter, then it also becomes a creator of jobs for the country. Eicher Motors has been our investment till now but there are plenty of other EV investments we need to research."

Click here for the full listOutlook for February 5Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP SecuritiesNifty surpassed the 22,000 mark during the first half of the Friday session but subsequently formed a double top on the hourly chart. Confirmation of a bullish trend resumption would only occur with a decisive breakout above the double top, which is currently identified around 22,125.Conversely, a break below the support level at 21,500 could indicate a bearish momentum. In the scenario of a breakout above 22,150, Nifty may experience upward momentum, potentially reaching levels such as 22,500 and beyond.Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP ParibasThe Nifty opened on a positive note and touched a new all-time High of 22126.80. It, however, faced sharp selling pressure and witnessed a sharp selloff which pushed the Nifty lower and back within the broad range 21200 – 21900.The daily and hourly momentum indicator provide a divergent signal and prices are stuck within a range. Bollinger bands are contracting indicating range bound price action. Thus, parameters are suggesting that the consolidation is likely to continue. Stock specific action and sector rotation is likely to continue during this period of consolidation. Key support levels are 21660 – 21600 while immediate hurdle zone is placed at 22100 - 22150.Bank Nifty witnessed selling pressure from the 46900 – 47000 zone which coincided with the 61.82% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire fall it has witnessed from 48636 – 44429. The Bank Nifty is likely to enter into a consolidation phase in the range 47000 – 45500 from short term perspective.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Here are seven stocks that still offer solid upside potential of over 30 percent, with reasonable valuations, and robust growth outlook.Adani Enterprises | CMP: Rs 3,153Cantor Fitzgerald has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,369The flagship firm of the Adani Group has started to regain investor confidence after the apex court cleared the air for the company. Experts suggest that risk-reward is in favour of the investors at current levels and the company is the most reliable for bringing energy resources into India (- this needs to be attributed). Its current valuation is largely driven by three main segments namely airports, roads, and its new energy ecosystem. Adani Enterprises shares have jumped over 43 percent in the past three months.HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,466CLSA has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,025Notwithstanding near-term concerns over strain on the lender's net interest margin and sluggish deposits post its mega-merger, HDFC Bank's sharp slump in January has turned its valuations attractive. Analysts say that concerns over deposits and NIMs are an overall industry snag, and not specific to HDFC Bank. Moreover, analysts see the lender as a long-term growth story, with the potential to sail through the near-term headwinds as its merger settles down. HDFC Bank has delivered marginally negative returns in the past three months.PVR Inox | CMP: Rs 1,434HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,140After a rather dull 2022 for Bollywood, the multiplex company is gradually getting back on its feet. Analysts see light at the end of the tunnel and believe that the content pipeline in CY25 will improve. Global brokerage firm HSBC said that the business fundamentals have stabilised and most concerns are transient. Elara Securities said the company's concerns were overdone, adding that PVR-Inox has a healthy outlook in the medium term. PVR Inox has fallen nearly 10 percent in the past three months.SBI Life Insurance | CMP: Rs 1,432BNP Paribas has an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 2,450The life insurer is one of the best bets out there in the insurance space. The company anticipates clocking in robust, industry-beating growth in the medium term, with solid VNB margins, that are likely to stick around 28 percent for FY24. Brokerages are also buying into the management's bullishness as they expect SBI Life to show margin resilience. The cherry on the cake is the stock's underperformance in the past three months, leaving room for a stronger comeback. The stock has gained 7 percent in the past three months, underperforming the benchmark Nifty's 15 percent gains.Cyient | CMP: Rs 1,939Morgan Stanley has an overweight call with a target price of Rs 2,700Analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest a robust fourth quarter amid demand visibility in key verticals such as connectivity and aerospace. In the previous quarters, communications bottoming out was a positive for the analysts, who are of the view that the strong performance from different verticals has made the outlook promising. Cyient shares have surged 17 percent in the past three months.Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,929HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,020After a stellar October-December quarter, analysts see the growth outlook as strong, and expect price wars to stabilise in the coming quarters. HSBC believes that fears of competition-based prices are exaggerated. As for the rural demand, the monsoon coupled with an uptick in government spending and moderating inflation is likely to bring in positivity for the rural economy. Asian Paints has lost 0.4 percent in the past three months.Sunteck Realty | CMP: Rs 470YES Securities has a buy call with a target price of Rs 586In recent years, Sunteck Realty has showcased an impressive track record of acquiring projects and ramped up its execution capabilities. A strong balance sheet, strong upcoming cash flow and a consolidating market make management optimistic about doubling its under-execution pipeline to Rs 600 bn in 3 years, making the stock a favourite among analysts. Meanwhile, current valuations also make the risk-reward favourable for Sunteck Realty, with new project additions being the key growth drivers. Shares of Sunteck Realty are up 7 percent in the past three months.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, layoffs in the sector have recently caused optimism to cool down.","Three of the biggest tech companies reported their quarterly earnings on February 1. Meta announced its first-ever dividend, while Amazon posted strong earnings. However, Apple reported a sales slowdown in its key China market. These three tech companies are part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" and have been driving a market resurgence. However, layoffs in the sector have recently caused optimism to cool down.Coming to the results, Apple announced its first revenue gain in over a year, though the company continues to grapple with a decline in global smartphone demand.The California-based company posted $119.58 billion in revenue and $2.18 in earnings per share (EPS), beating Wall Street expectations of $117.91 billion in full-year revenue and $2.10 in EPS. This 2 percent growth in sales is a positive sign for the tech giant, as it breaks the company's four-quarter streak of declining revenue. However, the company's shares dropped in after-hours trading.Despite the revenue growth, Apple's sales in China, its third-largest market, dropped from $23.9 billion to $20.8 billion. The company also saw a decline in global iPad sales, which dropped to $7 billion in the most recent quarter, from $9 billion in the same quarter last year.On a more positive note, Apple's iPhone sales increased to $69.7 billion in the three months ending in December 2023, up from $65.8 billion year-over-year. However, this news was dampened by the recent prediction by prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who forecasted that Apple's iPhone shipments would decrease by 15 percent year-over-year, due in part to a sizable drop in iPhone sales in China.Despite the challenges, Apple's services business maintained its growth, with the company posting $23.1 billion in revenue, up from $20.8 billion in services revenue the previous year. However, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company in January, hitting a $3 trillion valuation while Apple's market capitalisation slipped.Meta exceeded expectations with its fourth-quarter earnings report released on Thursday, revealing an impressive 25 percent increase in revenue from $32.2 billion to $40.3 billion. This marks the fastest rate of growth in any period since mid-2021 and is largely attributed to the rebounding online ad market, according to a CNBC report. Additionally, the company's cost-cutting measures led to an 8 percent decrease in expenses year over year, and an operating margin that more than doubled to 41 percent, indicating increased profitability.Compared to the previous year, Meta's net income increased more than threefold, from $4.65 billion to $14 billion, with earnings per share growing from $1.76 to $5.33.In a first for the company, Meta announced its intention to pay investors a dividend of 50 cents per share on March 26th. Meta also declared a $50 billion share buyback.Meanwhile, Amazon too, reported impressive fourth-quarter results on Thursday, surpassing analysts' expectations. The company's net income surged to $10.6 billion compared to $278 million in the same period last year.Furthermore, Amazon's first-quarter sales are expected to grow between 8 percent and 13 percent, reaching between $138 billion and $143.5 billion. This is higher than analysts' estimates of $142.1 billion, CNBC states. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing division, saw sales climb 13 percent in the fourth quarter to $24.2 billion, in line with Wall Street's forecast. However, it was a deceleration from the year-ago period when sales grew 20 percent.On the other hand, Amazon's advertising unit saw impressive growth, with sales increasing by 27 percent year over year to $14.7 billion. The company has started showing ads on Prime Video content, which analysts predict will generate significant new revenue for the business.Wall Street Reaction Meta Platforms and Amazon.com saw a combined increase of $280 billion in their stock market value on Thursday after reporting their quarterly results. Apple's market value decreased by $70 billion following its results.Amazon's stock rose by 8 percent as the company exceeded expectations for December-quarter revenue growth due to strong online spending during the holiday shopping season. This brought the online shopping and cloud-computing giant's market capitalization to $1.78 trillion.Meta's shares rose by over 14 percent to a record high of $451, increasing its market capitalisation by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion. This came after the social media giant announced its first-ever dividend. Despite dividends being typically associated with mature, slow-growth companies, Meta delivered a 25 percent increase in revenue, reaching $40.1 billion in the December quarter, thanks to strong advertising and device sales.Apple's quarterly results were better than expected, but the company's sales in China fell short of estimates, which caused its stock to fall by 3.3 percent. Apple faces tough competition in China, and this has been a concern for Wall Street in recent months."

On the downside, crucial support levels lie at 21,350 and 21,100.","The benchmark Nifty has been showing a bullish trend with consistent higher tops and higher bottoms on monthly time frames. However, a recent Doji candle pattern at the life-high level suggests potential fatigue in the positive market sentiment. The corrective phase emerged in the last couple of weeks after reaching a fresh life high at 22,124 on the weekly chart.Despite the correction, the Nifty made a 'higher top higher bottom' formation this week, indicating strong demand at lower levels. On the daily charts, the index is in a consolidation range between 21,350 and 21,850 levels, signaling a short-term sideways sentiment.Critical technical indicators, especially the relative strength index (RSI), continued to show positive momentum, maintaining levels above 60 on weekly and monthly intervals. However, the RSI on the daily time frame hovers around the 55, indicating a neutral momentum in the short term.Looking forward, immediate resistance levels for the Nifty are identified at 21,850, with an additional hurdle at 22,124, representing the life-high level. On the downside, crucial support levels lie at 21,350 and 21,100.Considering the overall chart structure, there is an anticipation of short-term volatility. The recommendation is to consider buying at support near the 21,450–21,400 zone, targeting an upside potential ranging from 21,800 to 21,850 levels. It is advised to implement a strict stop-loss at 21,350 on a closing basis to effectively manage risks.Here are three buy calls for 3-4 weeks:Indian Overseas Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 52 | Stop-Loss: Rs 46 | Target: Rs 62 | Return: 19%IOB is presently trading at its 52-week highs, indicating a strong and resilient momentum in the market.

This consistent upward trajectory aligns with a classical uptrend, highlighting a robust price structure.Furthermore, the stock maintains its position above both the 20-week and 50-week EMA (exponential moving average), reinforcing the bullish trend. The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has provided a bullish crossover in the positive territory, underscoring the trend's strength backed by substantial momentum.A noteworthy observation is the ratio chart of IOB against Nifty, which indicates a change of polarity. This shift showcases the stock's robust strength and potential for continuous outperformance compared to the broader market.Looking forward, there is an anticipation of further price ascent towards Rs 62 mark. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 46, strictly based on the closing basis.BSE: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,493 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,980 | Target: Rs 2,973 | Return: 19 percentBSE is currently trading within a clear rising structure, nearing its all-time highs, indicating robust momentum in the market. The stock has consistently formed higher highs and higher lows, initially breaking out from a falling wedge bullish pattern.More recently, it witnessed another breakout from a triangular pattern, considered a shallow retracement of the prior rally. This breakout was supported by a significant surge in volume, surpassing the 10-week average, suggesting a continuation of the upward trend.The stock's shallow retracement found support near the 20-week average, reflecting a mean reversion. The subsequent follow-up rally in the current week affirms the trend's continuation.Additionally, the RSI has shown a positive signal, reverting upside from a trend line connected since 2021. This reinforces the bullish momentum, underlining a favorable outlook for BSE in the current market conditions.Looking ahead, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting Rs 2,973 level. It is recommended to set a stop-loss at Rs 1,980 based on closing values.Container Corporation of India: Buy | LTP: Rs 921 | Stop-Loss: Rs 854 | Target: Rs 1,048 | Return: 14 percentContainer Corporation has initiated a bullish surge, backed by a series of technical validations. The stock consistently establishes higher tops and bottoms, signifying a sustained upward momentum. Notably, a significant structural development is evident with the swing high of November 2022 now acting as support, highlighting the stock's robustness.The stock confidently trades above crucial moving averages, including the 12-week and 26-week EMA. This alignment with the moving averages not only reinforces the positive momentum but also instills confidence in the stock's continuous upward trajectory.This bullish sentiment is further corroborated by indicators like ADX (average directional index) and DI (directional indicator). With the ADX at 36, a well-established trend is indicated, and the +DI consistently remaining above 25 underscores the strength of the positive momentum.Looking ahead, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting Rs 1,048 level.

""We will expand the EV ecosystem by encouraging the adoption of electric mobility in the public transport sector,"" Sitharaman said in her budget speech.This announcement sent shares of EV manufacturers like JBM Auto as well as EV component makers, including Servotech Power and Samvardhana Motherson up by 2-5 percent.PSU Bank stocksThe government's decision to reduce its borrowing plan for FY25 to Rs 14.1 lakh crore as against Rs 15.1 lakh crore in FY24 triggered strong buying across PSU bank stocks. This is because a fall in the government's borrowing plan helps ease yields, which benefits PSU bank players as they invest heavy chunks of capital in treasury bonds.On that account, most PSU bank stocks, including Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, UCO Bank, South Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Bank of Baroda and PNB moved 3-8 percent higher.What the market liked and did not in Interim BudgetDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana), the initiative launched in 2015 to offer affordable housing saw a marginal increase in the overall allocation from Rs 79,590 crore in FY24 to Rs 80,671 crore in FY25.

Apart from the multi-year growth opportunity due to large credit under-penetration in the rural and semi-urban regions, the segment also has high yields across cycles, given higher delinquencies for smaller loans.Well-established companies such as Home First Finance, Aavas Financiers and Aptus Value Housing will likely be the key beneficiaries of housing push. Small players like Repco Home Finance and India Shelter Finance Corporation will also gain from this.Backed by marquee investors, these companies are growing rapidly with rising disbursements. This boost to low-cost housing will clearly increase the credit demand and benefit existing players.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page"

This year too agriculture garnered tremendous focus as the finance minister announced empowering poor, women, youth and farmers as the top 4 priorities.Subsidy outlaySubsidy forms a large part of the government’s budget and reducing the subsidy outlay is one of the top priorities. For FY24-25 the total fertilizer subsidy was announced at Rs. 164,000 crore, which is a decline of 6 percent YoY (Rs 175,100 crore budgeted for FY23-24).It is important to note that this reduction in subsidy has been announced in line with the sharp fall seen in the raw material prices and thus is not likely to have any harsh impact on the fertilizer manufacturers.On the other hand, the food subsidy outlay continued to be on the higher end and was increased by 4 percent to Rs 205,250 crore compared to Rs 197, 350 crore in FY23-24.Focus on Nano DAPIndia imports about 50 percent of DAP, which is a key phosphatic fertliser. The budget focused on the usage of Nano DAP and announced extending its application for all agro-climactic zones, which is a big positive. Nano fertilizers will improve crop yield with less fertiliser consumption, lighten the subsidy budget, and will cut down import requirements.Budget allocation for agriculture mechanizationThe government launched Namo Drone Didi' programme in Nov 2023, which aims to provide drones to 15,000 women Self Help Groups (SHGs) during the period FY24-25 and FY25-26 for providing rental services to farmers for agriculture purposes.The Kisan Drone Subsidy Programme has also been initiated with the goal of streamlining tasks like spraying to reduce time and labour.This budget included a separate Rs 500 crore allocation towards the Namo Drone scheme, which is an assertive step towards promoting agricultural drones on a commercial scale.Focus on Bio agri inputsThere has been an increased awareness and adoption of organic and bio-fertilizers. The government is promoting natural farming under the Bharatiya Prakritik Krishi Paddhati Programme (BPKP).For the first time the union budget included a separate Rs 100 crore fund for the promotion of organic fertilizers.ConclusionCoromandel International and Paradeep Phosphates will be big beneficiaries from the push towards Nano fertilizers as both have the technology in place to launch Nano DAP in coming quarters and are invested in drone technology.Additionally, Coromandel is one of the largest organic fertiliser marketers in India and Dhanuka Agritech has a range of biological products in its pipleline. Both these companies should benefit from increased preference for bio agri inputs."

Inland and aquaculture production and seafood exports have doubled since a separate fisheries department was set up a few years earlier.India is the 3rd largest fish producing country with around 8 percent share in global fish production. Globally, India stands 2nd in aquaculture production and is one of the top shrimps producing and exporting nations. Coastal aquaculture, particularly shrimp farming, is the most vibrant food producing sector in India, earning high foreign exchange. Frozen shrimp contributed nearly 70 percent of USD 8 billion worth of seafood exports from the country during FY23.In 2020, the Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with the goal of transforming the country's fisheries and aquaculture sector.  The PMMSY scheme focuses on developing and modernizing fishing harbors, landing centers, fish markets, and fish-landing centers and has witnessed a total outlay of almost Rs 20,000 crore over a period of five years, from 2020 to 2024-25.During the Interim Budget 2024, the finance minister announced a new set of measures to boost the growth in the sector. Under the PMMSY, the government aims to double the aquaculture exports to nearly Rs 1 lakh crores and generate over 50 lakh job employment opportunities. Besides this, the government also plans to set up five integrated Aqua parks.The Indian seafood industry has been struggling off late due to oversupply, falling prices and a competitive landscape. Ecuador that has been gaining market share in US, Europe and other geographies has replaced India as the shrimp export leader in recent years by offering its produce at cheaper prices. Therefore, the efforts to increase productivity and yields under this scheme should provide much-needed tailwinds for fisheries as well as shrimp exporters.  The move augurs well for Avanti Feeds (largest producer of shrimp feed in India with a market share of 50 percent in the domestic feed business) and Apex Frozen Foods (integrated producer and exporter of frozen shrimp)."

Hence, investors should not pay much heed to the budget day market movements.Source: Moneycontrol ResearchIndia is now a multi-year growth opportunity and the reforms process is a steady exercise and not a one-off issue. Hence, investors usually get over the budget’s impact in a few trading sessions.However, what matters for the markets in the medium to long term is the earnings trajectory. To that extent, any budgetary announcement that can lead to meaningful earnings revision will merit attention. Also, the valuation of the markets has a bearing on the post-budget movement.Source: Moneycontrol ResearchOur analysis suggests that whenever the one-year forward Price Earnings of the Nifty is above 21x,  markets have delivered a one-month negative return post the budget.Seen in this context, the current valuation at 19.1x one-year is not only reasonable but at a discount to the ten-year average of 19.5x. Hence, going by historical trends, we do not foresee a negative one-month return.We believe India’s current strengths — the transition to sustainable energy, the trillion-dollar manufacturing exports opportunity, its unique advantage to become a global service hub, the great infrastructure build-up along with the evergreen consumption opportunity — are mega trends for investors to ride on for many more years.The earnings growth story in India is trending higher in a structural manner, supported by favourable demographics, improved labour productivity, and a multipolar world that will drive up services exports and FDI. The formalisation of the economy is getting reflected in the earnings growth of Corporate India. We have reasons to believe that beyond the earnings growth, there are several structural changes, including reduced reliance on volatile foreign flows, the coming of age of Indian retail investors, and a rising share of stable domestic liquidity, which will keep inflows into equities elevated for many more years.Hence, any weakness in this market will be short-lived and bought into for the long term.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page"

For the quarter ended December 2023, Paytm reported a 38 percent on-year (YoY) increase in revenue at Rs 2,850 crore, and its consolidated net loss narrowed to Rs 220 crore. The company's EBITDA before employee stock option (ESOP) grew to Rs 219 crore.There were expectations that Paytm would likely report breakeven on EBITDA in FY25. However, this might not be possible after the RBI action, according to analysts. ""We think revenue & profitability implications in the medium to long term could be significant and remain a key item to monitor,"" said Macquarie in its report.""We have seen RBI take 15 months time to revoke its ban on digital business activities of the largest private sector bank. However, in this case, since the first ban (in March 2022) for onboarding new customers (22 months have lapsed), RBI has conducted a comprehensive IT audit and continued to identify non-compliance, which in our view indicates that these lapses are quite material,"" the brokerage firm further noted.On February 1, 2024, shares of Paytm settled marginally lower at Rs 761.20 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). The stock is still 65 below its IPO price of Rs 2,150.Jefferies has downgraded its rating on shares of Paytm to 'underperform' from its previous 'buy' call, while slashing the price target for the stock by more than half to Rs 500. Macquarie has a 'neutral' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 650 per share.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

On March 11, 2022, the RBI directed Paytm Payments Bank to stop onboarding new customers with immediate effect,"" it said.Also Read | RBI imposes major business restrictions on Paytm Payments BankPaytm, listed as One97 Communications Ltd (OCL), has been informed that the action against its associate PBBL does not impact user deposits in their savings accounts, wallets, FASTags, and NCMC accounts, where they can continue to use the existing balances. ""OCL, as a payments company, works with various banks (not just Paytm Payments Bank), on various payments products. OCL started to work with other banks since starting of the embargo,"" said Paytm.Going forward, Paytm will be working only with other banks, and not with Paytm Payments Bank. The Paytm Payment Gateway business (online merchants) will continue to offer payment solutions to its existing merchants. OCL’s offline merchant payment network offerings like Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, Paytm Card Machine, will continue as usual, where it can onboard new offline merchants as well, the company informed.Concerning the direction on termination of nodal account of OCL and Paytm Payments Services Limited (PPSL) by February 29, 2024, OCL and PPSL will move the nodal to other banks during this period, Paytm said in a release. ""OCL’s other financial services such as loan distribution, insurance distribution and equity broking, are not in any way related to PBBL and are expected to be unaffected by this direction,"" it said.Separately, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma reconfirmed to Paytm that he has not taken any margin loans, or otherwise pledged any shares that are directly or indirectly owned by him.The fintech major also clarified that as per banking regulations, Paytm Payments Bank Limited is run independently by its management and board. ""While OCL is allowed to have two board seats on the board of Paytm Payments Bank Limited, as a part of its shareholder agreement, OCL exerts no influence on the operations of Paytm Payments Bank Limited, other than as a minority board member, and minority shareholder,"" it said.Paytm share price impactShare price of One 97 Communications (Paytm) may crash to the lower circuit on February 1 due to the RBI crackdown on Paytm Payments Bank, effectively putting an end to the firm's banking activities. Institutional investors may dump the stock over concerns that the contagion may spread to Paytm’s other key businesses. This will give a body blow to its business, say analysts and fund managers.Also Read | Paytm stock to see sharp cut as institutions may dump stock; reputational risk greater than earnings impactJayant Kharote, Equity Analyst at Jefferies India, said that Paytm’s wallet business, which is 5 percent of GMV, may need to be wound down. Also, Fastag GMV, where Paytm is the third largest player with 17 percent market share, will be majorly affected. All these customers will now likely migrate to other players in the market. ""Key impact can be on lending business (more than 20 percent of revenues) if lending partners limit business due to operational/governance risks,” he said.Fund managers and analysts are expecting a 5-15 percent earnings per share (EPS) impact. This will deepen the worry as the company has been trying hard to become profitable. There were expectations that the company would likely report breakeven on EBITDA in FY25.Some leading fund managers told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity there may be no point holding Paytm stock as the RBI move casts a long shadow on the way ahead.On January 31, Paytm shares settled marginally lower at Rs 761.00 on the National Stock Exchange. The improving business performance led to a rally in Paytm share price as buyers returned even as some pre-IPO shareholders exited the stock. The stock is up 45 percent in the last one year.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Also, the previous 3–4 months have exceptionally gone well.

In December quarter, L&T's domestic order flow was down 44 percent YoY.A boost to public capex could bode well for the company, believe most analysts, however foreign broking firm Jefferies is of a different view. It recently cut L&T to neutral in its model portfolio, anticipating only 7-8 percent capex growth as fiscal consolidation takes a toll.Budget 2024: Can housing and housing finance companies get a boost from Nirmala Sitharaman?2.

NTPC (CMP: Rs 318)According to the Central Electricity Authority, India's peak power demand will cross the 260 GW mark in 2025-26 and hit 277 GW by 2026-27.

REC (CMP: Rs 498)Speaking of power demand and renewable energy, non-banking financier of power projects REC will be on investors' watchlist today. The stock has already rallied 300 percent over the past one year, but the Street is optimistic that there is more steam left to the rally.Investors will also watch out for more details on Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, for which REC is the nodal agency. It is committed to provide a line of credit of Rs 1.2 lakh crore for this rooftop solar project, which aims to achieve 40 GW of rooftop solar capacity by March 2026.6.

National Fertiliser (CMP: Rs 126.5)The Union Budget is likely to look at an allocation lower than Rs 1.75 lakh crore for fertiliser subsidy in 2024-25 owing to a drop in international prices, government push towards schemes for use of bio and organic fertilisers and increased use of nano urea, a government official told Moneycontrol.In the current fiscal year (2023-24), the fertiliser subsidy is likely to touch Rs 1.88 lakh crore.Lower allocation could be a dampener for fertiliser stocks, though the general sentiment is that government will be proactive in supporting farmer by providing food and fertiliser subsidies.Union Budget 2024: What to expect for railway sector13 and 14. RVNL (CMP: Rs 309.25), IRCON (CMP: Rs 237.9)CareEdge Ratings anticipates a budgetary allocation of around Rs 3 lakh crore for the railway sector in Union Budget 2024-25, reflecting a 25 percent increase from the previous year.This will advance Vande Bharat trains, station redevelopment, and new tracks, contributing to a bull run in railway stocks.

So, any boost to these sector will bode well for cement stocks as well. ""Furthermore, under the National Infrastructure Plan, the government has plans to enhance India's infrastructure which will expedite highway projects. This is expected to increase demand for cement,"" said Axis Securities.Also, any development in Pradhan Manti Gram Sadak Yojna and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna will be a positive for cement companies.

ENA costs have been high for over a year now due to an uptick in the cost of grains such as barley, maize, and sugarcane.Prices of barley and wheat are still inflationary, and the government might undertake some initiatives to bring down agri-commodity prices in the Interim Budget, said Karan Taurani, Senior Vice President at Elara Securities. ""Announcements in terms of farmer incentives might help in lowering agricultural commodity prices,"" he said.Stay tuned with Moneycontrol's LIVE blog on Budget 2024Taurani also said that announcements on delaying the 20 percent ethanol blending target for FY25 can also help the alco-beverage industry. Currently, 10 percent of ethanol is blended with petrol. The government increased this to blending 20 percent ethanol with petrol and wants it to be followed from 2025. ENA costs might inch up further if more ethanol goes for blending and so alco-beverage companies want the FY25 deadline to be postponed.Stocks likely to move as a result of these announcements are United Spirits, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan.The overall alcohol industry will report revenue numbers similar to FY24 in FY25 due to input price inflation and no further price hikes, said Taurani.Premium category alcohol is expected to grow faster compared to the regular category in FY25, say experts. ""Prestige and Above (PA) category will see a double-digit revenue growth in FY25 and medium-to-high single digit volume growth in the same period,"" said Thakur. However, revenues from the regular category will continue to decline.""We expect premiumisation to aid growth as consumer preferences are shifting to better quality liquor. We expect the trend of uptrading from regular to PA as a structural and sustainable trend and aid overall growth for the sector,"" said B&K Securities in a report on the sector.CigarettesNo incremental announcements on cigarettes are expected in the Interim Budget, experts Moneycontrol spoke to said.""The government will most likely not increase taxes on cigarettes because it lowers their revenue,"" said Preeyam Toila, Equity Research Analyst at Axis Securities. He also said that the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD), a type of tax on cigarettes was revised last year so any new tax changes this year are unlikely. NCCD on specific cigarettes was raised by 16 percent in the last budget.Increasing taxes on cigarettes is also aimed at trying to lower consumption. However, experts say it does not reduce cigarette consumption, and sometimes leads to some people shifting to cheaper alternatives like bidis and chewing tobacco. Plus, the government loses revenues from organised players.Between FY13-17, excise duty on cigarettes grew at a CAGR of 15.7 percent, while the taxes remained stable during FY18-20. ITC wrote in its annual report that during FY13-17, the government's tax revenues increased by only 4.7 percent. Tax revenue collections grew 10.2 percent during the period of stable cigarette taxes.Stocks which could likely move from any announcements in the sector are ITC, VST Industries and Godfrey Phillips.In cigarettes, volumes and revenues are expected to grow slower in FY25 because of a high base, said Toila. After the pandemic, cigarette volumes and revenue increased due to high out-of-home consumption, creating a high base. People returning to offices contributed to the noticeable increase in cigarette sales during the same period. Also, the trend of organised cigarette players clawing back market share from illicit players will continue in FY25, said experts.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, Bernstein expects no immediate impact to One97 Communications' UPI Payment business that accounts for 70 percent of GMV (gross merchandise value).The central bank on January 31 said that Paytm Payments Bank will not be allowed to accept fresh deposits, undertake credit transactions, or top-ups in any customer accounts.

Bernstein differs here as it sees no impact to lending business.Wallets, which forms 5 percent of GMV, may need to be wound down and Fastag GMV where Paytm is the third largest player with 5.8 crore customers will also be majorly affected, noted Jefferies.

The former will have marginal impact on business, whereas the latter can have material impact,"" Jefferies said.Investors and analysts now keenly await Paytm managing director Vijay Shekhar Sharma's statement on RBI's restrictions. To be sure, when RBI had banned Paytm Payments Bank from onboarding new customers back in 2022, Sharma had said that the entity operates at an 'arm's length' from One97 Communications.Stock movementThe stock gained close to 60 percent last calendar year till November, but then saw a sharp fall when RBI cautioned against rising unsecured consumer loans in the system.

""Railways may see the highest increase in allocation, with spending up by nearly 40 percent year-on-year in FY24 year-to-date,"" they said.Budget 2024: Govt capex growth likely to slow down to 10% in FY25Against this, shares of IRCTC, Rail Vikas Nigam, IRCON International and Indian Railways Finance Corporation will be closely watched. These shares have rallied in the range of 9 percent to 78 percent in the past month, as against 1 percent decline in the benchmark Sensex.Earlier, the railways capex was announced at Rs 1.6 lakh crore. This year, analysts at ICRA estimate the capex for the sector to increase to Rs 2.4 lakh crore.Defence & aerospace indigenisation theme to playout; HAL, Bharat Dynamics, Cochin Shipyard shares to gain tractionGiven the government's emphasis on the defence indigenisation theme, related stocks like Hindustan Aeronautics, Bharat Dynamics, Cochin Shipyard and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders will grab investors' attention ahead of the budget presentation.

All these stocks have surged between 20-40 percent over the last one year.Cement demand surged post-COVID recovery, driven by government spending and housing revival, leading to higher sales and prices in FY2024. Margins are set to rise as input costs have fallen for both the December quarter and the full year, analysts said.For the year ahead, cement firms are expecting a combination of strong demand and benign input costs to drive profitability. Analysts are pencilling in a 300-350 bps expansion in operating margins to 16.5-18.5 percent as prices of two key raw materials — pet coke and coal — have cooled down significantly.Also Read: 15 budget-sensitive stocks to watch todayAt the same time, there are concerns about potential oversupply, given the industry's capacity addition of 119 mtpa in the last five years, reaching 595 mtpa. Another 150-160 mtpa is expected in the next five years, of which 35-40 mt will be in this fiscal itself.Continued government emphasis on infrastructure and housing incentives in the Interim Budget could have a multiplier effect, particularly on cement. Analysts stress that the impact relies heavily on demand from affordable housing, which exhibited a soft trend in the past two to three quarters.""Amidst robust infrastructure development, we anticipate strong cement demand, spurred by budget increases in housing, roads, railways, and rural projects, and further boosted by initiatives like PMA,” said Arun Shukla, President and Director, JK Lakshmi Cement.Cement makers are hoping that the government will take steps to address rising input costs through lower GST rates and easing import duties on key materials like coal and petcoke.Budget expectationsStakeholders eagerly await the FY25 target for government capital spending, a key driver of economic growth. PM Modi, at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, outlined a vision for robust infrastructure growth, signaling potential policies and incentives in the Interim Budget 2024. Analysts suggest these measures could spur substantial development in the infrastructure sector.Recently, Moneycontrol reported a Ministry request for a Rs 3.25 lakh crore budgetary allocation for FY 2024-25, a 25 percent YoY increase, aiming to reduce market borrowings for the National Highways Authority of India. In the FY24 budget, the finance minister allocated Rs 10 lakh crore for infrastructure capital expenditure, a 33 percent increase.

An emphasis on maintaining competitive prices for raw materials and energy sources will significantly boost the Indian cement sector. We also remain hopeful of receiving sustained support through fiscal incentives and streamlined freight mechanisms, essential for thrusting the cement industry forward.

Here's why,"January 31, 2024 09:48 AM IST","The L&T stock has zoomed 71 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which has risen 21 percent during this period.","Shares of construction major L&T fell 5 percent on January 31 after the company's Q3 earnings missed Street estimates. Its net profit jumped 15 percent on-year to Rs 2,947 crore on better execution of infrastructure projects and continued growth in the IT and tech services portfolio. Its revenue also jumped 19 percent YoY to Rs 55,128 crore.While the December quarter numbers came in below street expectations, analysts remain bullish on the stock.Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect L&T to continue to benefit from the strong addressable market in both India and international locations. Going forward, the company's growth is expected to be driven by growth in order inflows; a gradual recovery in core EPC EBITDA margin; and control over working capital and net working capital (NWC).""We expect the infrastructure and hydrocarbon segments to remain the key growth drivers for LT,"" it noted.L&T's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 14 percent YoY to Rs 5,760 crore during the quarter. The company won orders worth Rs 75,990 crore at the group level during Q3 FY24, logging a 25.2 percent YoY growth. International orders at Rs 50,562 crore comprised 67 percent of the total order inflow.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionOutlookThe company's prospect pipeline for Q4 FY24 stands at Rs 6.3 lakh crore, up 29 percent YoY. The pipeline has been boosted by strong order inflows in the hydrocarbon segment. Stable oil prices auger well for prospects in the hydrocarbon segment and improve overall prospects in the Middle East, according to Motilal Oswal.L&T is cautiously bidding for thermal power projects, the brokerage noted. ""The hi-tech energy segment is still small, with a prospect pipeline of Rs 16,000 crore, but it will grow at a fast pace,"" the brokerage said.L&T has been focusing on reducing working capital through improved collections and better customer advances. The brokerage expects L&T's working capital to remain comfortable at around 17-18 percent of sales, as the overall project mix is changing in favor of projects that have NWC such as international and mega and ultra-mega projects.With expected improvements in margins in FY25, there is scope for further Return on Equity (RoE) expansion, it said.Stock call: Why you should buy L&T sharesMorgan Stanley has issued an overweight call on L&T with a target price of Rs 4,171 per share. The brokerage highlighted L&T's continued strong execution, despite potential ordering activity slowdown due to elections. However, the company's core margin guidance has been adjusted downward due to timing differences. On the positive side, L&T's working capital is expected to remain steady, it said.Motilal Oswal has a 'buy' rating on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 4,200 based on the SOTP methodology, valuing the core business at P/E of 28x Mar’26 EPS and a 25 percent holding company discount for subsidiaries.""Our higher multiple takes into account the continuously improving prospect pipeline and improvements in NWC and RoE despite margins being lower than guidance,"" it said.InCred has also issued an 'add' call on L&T, with a target price set at Rs 4,016 per share. L&T's management has revised its FY24 order inflow growth guidance upward to 20 percent from 15 percent earlier, reflecting confidence in future prospects, the brokerage noted.Additionally, the company has adjusted its FY24 revenue guidance to 15 percent from the previous range of 12-15 percent, driven by a robust order pipeline.Key risks and concernsA slowdown in order inflows, delays in the completion of mega and ultra-mega projects, a sharp rise in commodity prices, higher crude prices, an increase in receivables and working capital, and increased competition are a few downside risks for L&T, according to Motilal Oswal.Also Read | L&T Q3 results: Net profit rises 15% to Rs 2,947 crore, misses estimatesOn January 30, L&T shares closed 1.8 percent lower at Rs 3,639.85 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

This abrupt shift from a bullish sentiment to a bearish reversal signifies potential weakening of the prevailing uptrend. The Nifty concluded Tuesday's trading session near the 20 DMA at 21,520 levels, down 1 percent. While the 50 DMA is positioned at 21,200 levels as the next important support.The India VIX, the fear gauge, has experienced a significant surge and surpassed the 16 level. The last time India VIX closed above this threshold was in March 2023. This rise in the fear gauge suggests intensified market volatility.In summary, a break below the 20,500 level could lead to a downward movement in the Nifty, while surpassing the 22,124 level might signal the onset of the next rally targeting 22,750 and 23,000.Bank Nifty concluded at 45,368, marking a modest decline of 0.16 percent. Notably, Bank Nifty encountered robust resistance at 45,650-45,700 levels, leading to corrections in the preceding two sessions.The 200-day moving average (DMA) at 44,500 acts as a critical support with a breach below this level that could intensify selling in the index.In a broader context, following a correction of nearly 7 percent from its all-time high of 48,636.45, the Bank Nifty faces a crucial juncture. A further decline below the important level of 43,700, representing a nearly 10 percent correction, could signal the potential extended correction. On the other hand, if this level is defended, the path seems open for a gradual and steady ascent towards its previous peak levels.Here are three buy calls for short termDr Lal PathLabs: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,476 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,380 | Target: Rs 2,610 | Return: 5.4 percentThe stock is currently trading above its 20 simple moving average (SMA), reinforcing a robust support level in price action. Exiting the accumulation zone, the stock exhibits positive signal and is trading above the middle Bollinger band with a positive MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator crossover. These indicators suggest a bullish momentum highlighting the stock's strength.Although minor resistance exists around Rs 2,500 levels, once crossed, strong traction is expected on the higher side.Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 2,476.2 for a target price of Rs 2,610. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 2,380.Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,702 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,625 | Target: Rs 1,840 | Return: 8 percentIn the daily chart, the stock is actively shaping a compelling bottom double pattern showcasing a potential reversal. Its resilience is evident through consistent trading above the 20-day moving average.The RSI (relative strength index) of 57 emphasize a favourable bullish momentum, reinforcing the stock's strength. Notably, a noteworthy breakthrough occurred as the stock closed above the crucial 1,700 resistance levels indicating heightened buying interest especially among short-term traders.Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP of Rs 1,702.3 for a target price of Rs 1,840. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 1,625.DLF: Buy | LTP: Rs 786.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 755 | Target: Rs 840 | Return: 7 percentThe stock is demonstrating a bullish trend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows. It sustains a positive momentum by trading above both the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA).Significantly, it maintains a robust support level at 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement and remains above a sturdy support zone of Rs 770 levels. The noteworthy increase in delivery volume by 23 percent over the past month adds to the positive indicator as well.Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 786.9 for the target price of Rs 840.

Hence, if the index manages to hold the momentum, 21,850-22,000 is the area to watch out for on the higher side, which can give the confirmation to the start of a higher-high-higher-low formation, whereas on the other side, 21,600-21,500 is expected to be the near-term support area for the index, experts said.On January 29, the BSE Sensex rallied 1,241 points or 1.8 percent to 71,942, while the Nifty 50 surged 385 points or 1.8 percent to 21,738 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.6 percent and 1.5 percent.Stocks that smartly outperformed the broader markets as well as benchmarks included Reliance Industries, Power Finance Corporation (PFC), and MCX India.

The stock jumped 6 percent to Rs 3,415 and traded well above all key moving averages.Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Reliance IndustriesIt is rare to see this stock rally by more than 7 percent in single day. Reliance Industries surpassed its previous record highs of Rs 2,792 level and achieved fresh record highs of Rs 2,905 level which keeps the tone positive for the stock.Parabolic Sar dots has started to form below the price which is also suggesting that short term bias is bullish. Stochastic RSI (relative strength index) is also confirming the bullish bias as it has given bullish crossover. Stock has shown sharp upside move, buy on dips seems to be a prudent strategy.In short, Reliance is bullish. Buy on dips can be used to ride the trend as far as price hold Rs 2,790 on the downside for further upside levels of Rs 3,000.PFCOn the below chart, we can see that stock has given breakout of the rectangular pattern, indicating up move post accumulation. In the previous session, price has closed above Rs 432 with increase in volume. This confirms breakout of the trading range.Along with this, MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has also shown a bullish crossover which is acting as a double confirmation.In short, trend for PFC looks positive. Use dips towards Rs 432 as a buying opportunity with the target of Rs 465 as long as Rs 410 holds on the downside.MCX IndiaMCX price gave breakout from consolidation technical pattern which keeps the tone positive.

The Nifty also closed above its 11-day and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) suggesting a bullish trend reversal.In the options segment, we have seen aggressive Put writing at the 21,500-21,600 levels. This level coincides with the 5, 11 and 20-day EMA which are placed at 21,540, 21,565 and 21,534, respectively. Therefore, we believe that on the downside, 21,500-21,600 levels would act as a strong support.Traders are advised to accumulate longs in the Nifty with a stop-loss at 21,500 on a closing basis.There is an unfilled gap in the range of 21,850-21,970 which can act as an immediate resistance for the Nifty.

RBI allowed LIC to buy up to a 9.99 percent stake in the private sector lender from its current hold of 5.2 percent. This will be sentimentally positive for the stock and any downside from here on would be limited, said analysts.""We expect HDFC Bank stock to recover current losses and jump back by 15 percent in the next one year,"" said Chokkalingam G, Founder at Equinomics Research. He said that the bank is increasing its focus on rural and semi-urban areas and this will prove to be the next growth levers.Shares of HDFC Bank tumbled 14 percent after the lender's Q3 financials came below Street estimates. Factors like fall in earnings per share (EPS), margin strain and sluggish deposit growth contributed to the negative sentiment around the stock. As a result, Bank Nifty, wherein it carries a 40 percent weightage also declined by over a percent.ALSO READ: HDFC Bank stock gains 2% after LIC gets RBI nod to buy 4.8% additional stakeLIC's additional stake buyout in HDFC Bank is a 'value-buy', say expertsMarket experts believe that LIC's proposed additional stake buyout of 4.8 percent comes at a time when the lender's stock valuation turned attractive post its steep fall. They believe that the buyout would be gradual in process, spread over a one-year time frame and not an immediate one-time acquisition.""LIC will start buying its approved additional stake in HDFC Bank in a slow manner. Since HDFC Bank's valuations have turned attractive from historical averages, it is most likely expected that LIC will complete the rest of its acquisition,"" said VK Vijayakumar, Chief Market Strategist at Geojit Financial Services.Currently, HDFC Bank stock trades at 2.4-2.5 times (x) price-to-book (PB) value as against historical averages of 4xPB value, said analysts.The RBI has advised LIC to complete its approved shareholding in HDFC Bank within a period of one year, that is by January 24, 2025. LIC’s current stake at HDFC Bank is valued at nearly Rs 50,000 crore. So another round of Rs 50,000 crore fresh buyout will be done gradually, added Chokkalingam G of Equinomics Research.Kaitav Shah, lead BFSI analyst at Anand Rathi Institutional Equities sees LIC's additional stake approval in HDFC Bank as a 'value buy.' He believes that LIC's support will bode well for the stock that saw merger challenges this quarter.""Though we expect merger pangs to persist for the next couple of quarters, the bank may come out as winner once it balances its margin and growth pain. We will take another year to assess the bank's profitability due to its recent merger, hence, sharing a 'hold' call,"" he told CNBC-TV18.ALSO READ: Daily Voice | This market strategist says downside risk to HDFC Bank limitedLIC's shareholding in HDFC Bank vs other private peersHistorically, LIC has been increasing its stake in HDFC Bank over the last few quarters.

Click here for the full listOutlook for January 30Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares:Today's trade belonged to the Energy segment especially giants i.e. Reliance and ONGC. After commencing the week on a strong note around its crucial resistance of 21,500, the Index kept on compounding its gains in the presence of follow-through and finally settled at 21,737.60 with gains of 385 points.Barring FMCG, all other sectors ended the day in green with Energy and PSU Banking being the top performers. In one go only, the Index has breached its multiple hurdles (21,500 & 21,700) and formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart; however, we assume that Nifty may witness some pressure around 21,750.It is premature to say but there is a possibility of forming an Inverted Head & Shoulder pattern. The immediate resistance is placed at 21,850 while the downside seems to be protected at 21,570.Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas:The Nifty opened gap up and continued to inch higher throughout the day to close in the green up ~385 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has breached the previous swing high of 21750 and hence violates the downtrend as the lower top lower bottom formation has been violated. During the fall the Nifty held on to the support of the 40-day average placed around 21200 which shall now act as a lower boundary during the consolidation phase.On the upside, the Index can continue its pullback towards 21913 which coincides with the 78.6% fibonacci retracement level of the fall from 22124 – 21137 and also the gap formed on the 17th January, 2024 in the range 21850 – 22000 shall act as an immediate hurdle going ahead. The daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover however it has reached the equilibrium line and also prices are not showing weakness which can lead to a range bound action over the next few trading sessions. Considering the above parameters we shall change our outlook on the Nifty to sideways and the broad range of consolidation is likely to be 21200 – 22000.Bank Nifty is in the process of retracing the fall it has witnessed from 48300 – 44500 and hence the pullback can continue till 46000 – 46200 from short term perspective. On the downside 45110 is the crucial support from short term perspective.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

After negotiations, Disney’s India assets are now valued at around $4.5 billion, compared to its earlier demand for $10 billion, the report said. The combined entity aims for an $11 billion valuation, with Disney holding a 40 percent stake.Reliance Industries will own 51 percent, and the deal is set to be finalised in February, Bloomberg reported. The collapse of the $10 billion merger between Sony and Zee Entertainment removes a potential major competitor, the report added.The RIL stock gained 12 percent in January following positive commentary on peaking capex and strong retail performance. Analysts have raised target prices and maintained their ratings.In the fiscal third quarter, the company’s capital expenditure (capex) fell 22 percent to Rs 30,100 crore from the preceding three months. This drop was due to reduced spending by Jio after completing its 5G rollout across India and lower capex in its retail business due to limited space expansion.“We expect retail capex to decline Rs 15,000 crore on-year in FY24 and fall further in FY25. Also, Jio’s headline capex should fall Rs 30,000 crore in FY25, helping improve FCF (free cash flow) abating concerns on rise in net debt,” Jefferies India said.According to analysts, there was a slowdown in capex in the December quarter as the company neared completion of its 5G rollout. RIL has reported negative free cash flow over the past three years, primarily due to telecom spending. With the fading of these expenses and an EBITDA run rate of $20 billion annually, RIL is expected to generate positive free cash flow for the next two years. Although net debt slightly increased in the three months ended December 31, quarter-on-quarter, due to the repayment of other capex liabilities, analysts predict a downward trend in the future, supported by reduced capex and an improved EBITDA run rate.“We raise our FY24-26 EBITDA by 2-5 percent led by Jio (higher tariff hikes), retail (recent robust performance), and O2C (3Q beat). The stock’s recent outperformance, however, makes risk/reward more balanced, in our view, and we d/g to Neutral with Rs2,910 TP (+12 percent; roll-fwd). Key triggers – a surprise in the magnitude of tariff hikes, Jio/retail monetisation updates, deleveraging ahead of estimates,” said CITI in its latest note.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

India's sunflower oil imports are likely to decline in the coming months due to a surge in freight rates following the attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea by Yemen-based Houthi rebels since November, industry experts said. ""The attacks on the Red Sea have led to sunflower import freight rates increasing by $30 to $115 per tn,"" Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive officer at Sunvin Group told Informist. ""It is also a 15-day extra voyage as ships are forced to take longer routes from the Cape of Good Hope, Africa,"" Bajoria said. The traffic along the Red Sea – one of the world’s busiest waterways – has fallen more than two-thirds since Houthi rebels began targeting commercial shipping, Moody's Analytics said in a report last week. The Red Sea, which connects to the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal, accounts for about 80% of India's merchandise trade with Europe. The voyage time from Russia and Ukraine to India has gone up to 37 days from 22 days earlier, Bajoria said. He expects palm oil imports to India in 2024 to decline to 9 mln tn from 10 mln tn in 2023 and soyoil imports to increase to 4.5 mln tn from 3.5 mln tn. He, however, sees sunflower oil imports in 2024 remaining at 3.0 mln tn. India, one of the biggest importers of sunflower oil, uses the Black Sea region via the Suez Canal for most of its sunflower imports. In Nov-Dec, India imported 266,221 tn, or nearly 70% of its total sunflower oil imports of 389,557 tn, from Romania, Russia and Europe. Argentina was the other major exporter of sunflower oil to India, exporting 85,012 tn during the same period, according to data from the Solvent Extractors' Association.

Expansion into new ventures like pumped storage and green hydrogen further contributes to the positive outlook.As per Bloomberg's survey of two analysts, the projected net profit for the period is Rs 4,930 crore, with the anticipated revenue reaching Rs 44646.80 crore.NTPC plans to boost coal production and add 7 GW of power in FY24, with less than 1 GW from renewable energy. This expansion encompasses projects like Barh-3, North Karanpura 2 and 3, Patrharu, Kurja, Hydro, and NREL. In FY25, NTPC aims to add 6 GW through projects such as Patratu 1 and 2, Tapovan Vishnugar, and Solar. The company has raised its standalone capital expenditure plans to Rs 31,100 crore by FY25 and Rs 35,000 crore by FY26, compared to Rs 24,500 crore in FY23.Analysts predict NTPC will benefit from the growth in renewables and the increasing demand for thermal capacity during peak shortages. The company is also investing in green hydrogen and carbon capture, offering strategic alternatives.With accelerated coal-based additions, NTPC has commissioned a 3.3GW of renewable capacity, with 7.3GW under construction and a 10GW project pipeline. Private sector involvement in adding coal-based power capacity is limited. NTPC's generation (excluding renewables) increased by 15 percent YoY to 84 BUs in Q3FY24, including the commissioning of the 50MW Dayapar Wind Energy Project.

Net sales are expected to drop 18% YoY and 6% QoQ to Rs 102991.50 crore. EBITDA for the quarter is projected to decline around 60% QoQ to Rs 6194.90 crore, as per seven analysts polled by Moneycontrol.","State-run oil marketing major Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is expected to see a sharp sequential decline in earnings for the December quarter, primarily because of a significant inventory loss, normalisation of GRMs, and a slightly lower marketing margin.Anticipated net profit is around Rs 3,303.80 crore, down around 70 percent QoQ, with a YoY increase of about 30 percent. Net sales are expected to drop 18 percent on-year and 6 percent on-quarter to Rs 10,2991.50 crore. EBITDA for the quarter is projected to decline around 60 percent QoQ to Rs 6,194.90 crore, as per seven analysts polled by Moneycontrol.Analysts expect BPCL to report a Gross Refining Margin (GRM) of $8.5 per barrel for the upcoming quarter, down from $18.5 in 2QFY24. This projection is based on a core GRM of $11.5, a crude inventory loss of $3.0 on each barrel, crude throughput at 9.3mmt (a 1 percent QoQ decrease), and marketing sales volume at 12.8mmt (a 2.4 percent QoQ increase).Additionally, the anticipated decline in auto fuel gross marketing margin to Rs2.8/ltr in 3QFY24 (compared to Rs3.3 per litre in 2QFY24) and an expected product inventory loss of $1.2 a barrel contribute to this outlook.Analysts said retail margins remained strong in the quarter, with estimated diesel retail margins at Rs 2 a litre (Rs -6 YoY, Rs -1 QoQ). Analysts also expect a 5 percent on-year growth in domestic retail sales. However, Singapore GRMs fell 14 percent YoY and 43 percent QoQ due to weak global product cracks. Analysts anticipate GRMs to remain flat both QoQ and YoY. Additionally, BPCL reported high inventory gain in Q2 due to an 11 percent QoQ increase in crude prices.JM Financial predicts that Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) are likely to face a substantial crude inventory loss of $3-5 per barrel in the upcoming quarter. This is attributed to a QoQ decline of $16 in the Brent crude price (averaging $78 a barrel in December 2023, compared to $94 in September 2023). Additionally, analysts anticipate an inventory loss of $1.2 a barrel in the marketing business.Due to a moderation in diesel cracks and a reduction in Russian crude discounts, the reported gross refining margin (GRM) for OMCs (adjusted for inventory loss) is expected to sharply decline to $6-8.5/bbl, in contrast to the $13.3-18.5/bbl reported in 2QFY24.The weighted average auto-fuel gross marketing margin for OMCs has also decreased to Rs2.8/ltr in 3QFY24, down from Rs3.3/ltr in 2QFY24, and below the normalized margin of Rs3.5/ltr. As a result, analysts project a significant 50-70 percent QoQ decline in OMCs' EBITDA for 3QFY24, compared to the record-high earnings reported in 1HFY24.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Crucial level to observe is 37,000. A breakthrough above this level can take prices higher towards the 39,000 levels,"" Ashish Kyal, CMT, founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, says in an interview to Moneycontrol.Overall tone for IT will remain bullish for months, he believes. And one can use dips to buy stocks from this sector, he advised.Kyal, with more than two decades of experience in capital markets, suggested five budget picks, including AIA Engineering, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT), and Strides Pharma. Excerpts from an interview with Moneycontrol:Do you think the rally is done in IRFC and Rail Vikas Nigam which were the top gainers in the current month?Both IRFC and RVNL has shown near-vertical rise but reversed sharply on January 23. These stocks are still overbought and further profit-booking is possible in these stocks after the Union Budget.Prices are already discounting positive outcome from the Budget session and can show dramatic reversals. So, one should now be cautious on these stocks as long as lifetime high levels remain protected.Also read: Stockology: Watch for divergence indicators in a volatile trading weekAre the charts telling you that the selling pressure is done in Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Polycab India?For ZEEL, after recent decision to call off the planned merger with Sony, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) experienced selling pressure and closed the last week with loss of 29.47 percent. The downtrend is evident on weekly chart. The formation of strong bearish candle and closing below its previous crucial support level of 175 is confirming the bearish bias.On the daily chart, after significant sell-off on Tuesday price is trading within the range since past two trading sessions which is Rs 171–157 levels. RSI (relative strength index) is trading near the 23 level, which is indicating that prices are in the oversold area, so a short-term pullback is possible but use that as an opportunity to sell.Also read: Market Action: Six IPOs to hit Dalal Street, 10 listings lined upIn short, ZEEL is bearish. A breach below Rs 157 can drag the prices lower towards the Rs 150 level with hurdles near Rs 185 on the upside.For Polycab India, after news of the Income Tax (I-T) department detected ""unaccounted cash sales"" of about Rs 1,000 crore, the stock tanked 23 percent on January 11 which has changed the overall structure to negative. Formation of a bearish candle suggests that the short-term bias is bearish.After strong selling pressure price is consolidating in range of Rs 4,550 – 3,800 since the past two weeks. The price broke its previous support of Rs 4,800 which is also confirming the bearish bias. Ichimoku cloud is indicating weakness in price cloud has formed near Rs 4,750 which can act as a potential resistance.In short, Polycab is sideways to bearish. A breach below Rs 4,050 can drag the prices lower at the Rs 3,650 level, whereas a break above Rs 4,550 can result into a deeper pullback towards Rs 4,700.Do you expect the Nifty 50 to consolidate with support at the 21,000 mark in the coming weeks? What are the chances of the index hitting 20,500 -20,000 levels?The Nifty has been forming lower highs and lower lows after touching a lifetime high levels near 22,124 on the upside. This was also near the target we have mentioned in earlier interviews. After forming the high, there was a sharp reversal on the downside.Over the past few days, we can see rangebound movement. On the downside, a breach below 21,210 might open the downside possibilities to 20,800, followed by 20,500 levels. However, on the upside, the major hurdle is near 21,720 followed by 21,840 levels. A move above this will suggest upside reversal.For now, the index is trading at crucial juncture before the Budget. Prices are failing to show momentum on either side. After a strong run-up until January 15, short-term correction is a healthy sign for the overall long-term positive market trend. In a nutshell, the 21,210 support will be a crucial level to be watched over the short term.Do you think the 44,000 is expected to be crucial support for the Bank Nifty for coming weeks?Bank Nifty has been major contributor to the downside. It has been leading the fall and the Bank Nifty showed one of the steepest declines from January 16, 2024. Over the near term, 44,300 remains an important support for this index and if this is breached, we can expect the downside momentum to increase for a move to the 43,600 levels.On the upside, 46,200 is going to be a short-term resistance. A move above this is must for meaningful pullbacks. As long as the same is intact, the banking index can remain under pressure.Is the Nifty IT creating rounding bottom pattern on the weekly and monthly charts? Does it mean that completion and breakout of the same pattern in coming weeks or months can generate robust returns in following weeks or months?In December 2023, Nifty IT has shown strong breakout of consolidation pattern. In our past interviews we have mentioned bullish stand when the index was near 32,000 levels and since then prices have rallied by nearly 15 percent to close last week at 36,500 levels.The IT index has been forming higher highs and higher lows keeping the overall tone positive.Crucial level to observe is 37,000. A breakthrough above this level can take prices higher towards the 39,000 levels. Overall tone for IT will remain bullish for months ahead and one can use dips to buy stocks from this sector.Which are you top 5 budget picks and why?AIA EngineeringAIA Engineering has recently witnessed a breakout from the range Rs 3,300 – 3,800 levels, with the price managing to close above the range. The stock has broken out from an attractive technical pattern which is ascending triangle pattern. A follow-up action beyond Rs 3,910 level, price can reach towards uncharted territory setting new record highs for target of Rs 4,200.Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT)After a long consolidation phase, FACT broke the range in previous trading session. The price is trading above the breakout from ascending triangle pattern, signalling a bullish bias. The closing above its previous high and record high closing indicate strength in the stock.The technical indicator MACD aligns with the breakout, which is confirming the positive outlook.

Japan's Nikkei was up 0.8 percent, while Kospi index gained 1 percent.US prices rise moderately in December; inflation trending lowerUS prices rose marginally in December, keeping the annual increase in inflation below 3 percent for a third straight month, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates this year.But the timing of the anticipated rate cut is uncertain, with the report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showing consumer spending surging at the end of 2023 as Americans splurged on goods and services over the holidays.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2 percent last month after dropping 0.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Food prices rose 0.1% and the cost of energy products increased 0.3 percent.ECB leaves key rates unchangedThe European Central Bank froze borrowing costs again on Thursday even as inflation eases, signalling it was too soon to start considering rate cuts.The third consecutive pause since October leaves the ECB's benchmark deposit rate at a record high of four percent, following a historic run of hikes to tame prices that shot up after Russia's war in Ukraine.The pause was widely expected but with inflation steadily slowing and the eurozone economy stuttering, investor attention has shifted to when the ECB might start cutting rates.The ECB's governing council reiterated in its statement that it believed rates are at levels that ""maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution"" to returning inflation to the two-percent target.US economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.3% pace last quarterThe US economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk 3.3 percent annual pace from October through December as Americans showed a continued willingness to spend freely despite high interest rates and price levels that have frustrated many households.Thursday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product the economy's total output of goods and services decelerated from its sizzling 4.9 percent growth rate the previous quarter. But the latest figures still reflected the surprising durability of the world's largest economy, marking the sixth straight quarter in which GDP has grown at an annual pace of 2 percent or more. Consumers fueled much of last quarter's expansion.For all of 2023, the economy grew 2.5 percent, up from 1.9 percent in 2022.RBI allows LIC to acquire up to 9.99% stake in HDFC BankThe Reserve Bank of India has allowed Life Insurance Corp. of India to acquire as much as 9.99 percent of HDFC Bank, the country's largest private lender told stock exchanges on January 25.""LIC has been advised by RBI to acquire the aforesaid major shareholding in the Bank within a period of one year i.e. by January 24, 2025,"" HDFC Bank said in an exchange filing. ""Further, LIC must ensure that the aggregate holding in the Bank does not exceed 9.99 percent of the paid-up share capital or voting rights of the Bank at all times,"" said HDFC Bank.LIC owns a 5.19 percent stake in the bank, according to the lender's shareholding pattern as of December 31.As per the bank's exchange notification, the RBI informed the decision to the LIC through a letter dated January 25, under which LIC can acquire an aggregate holding up to 9.99 percent of the paid-up share capital or voting rights of HDFC Bank Limited.Crude OilOil prices jumped 1 percent on Monday on fuel supply concerns after a missile struck a Trafigura-operated fuel tanker in the Red Sea and as Russian refined products exports are set to fall as several refineries are under repair after drone attacks.Brent crude futures climbed 83 cents to $84.38 a barrel by 2341 GMT after hitting a session-high of $84.80.

In the case of any negative surprises, Nifty may decline towards 20,800 or even towards the bullish gap of 20,500.","The Nifty 50 slipped on the monthly expiry day on January 25 at the end of a volatile session, concluding the week with a percent cut, just above 21,350.For the second consecutive week, the Nifty experienced a decline, with bears seemingly in control, selling into any minor bounce. The charts exhibit a distorted pattern with a 'lower top lower bottom' formation on the daily chart, signaling a bearish reversal.When examined on a broader scale, a 'head and shoulders' pattern confirms a bearish trend. This does not bode well for the bulls, suggesting potential challenges in the short term. The current week is crucial, aligned with the key Budget event, which typically sets the market direction. The Budget week is known for volatility, and considering the above formation we lean towards the bearish side.In this scenario, the levels to monitor are around the psychological 21,000 mark, coinciding with 50-SMA (simple moving average). In the case of any negative surprises, the Nifty may decline towards 20,800 or even towards the bullish gap of 20,500.On the flip side, the resistance is anticipated, with 21,500 and the week's high of 21,750 seen as formidable obstacles before the Nifty targets the recent landmark high of around 22,100.The volatility is expected to be high, especially on the Budget day, where the market will witness wild swings in reaction to announcements by the finance minister.

It has already corrected nearly 15 percent in such a short span and has now reached its major support zone of Rs 506 which coincides with the ‘200-day SMA’.However, the way prices have confirmed a breakdown on Thursday’s session, this sacrosanct support is in jeopardy now. With ‘RSI-Smoothened’ continuing with its downward slope, there is no hope for any notable recovery in the coming week.We recommend selling around Rs 512 - 514 for a near-term target of Rs 493.

The BSE capital Goods Index, a collection of 27 stocks, which includes mid and small caps as well, has rallied 71 percent over the last year.Nirav Parikh, co-founder Molecule Ventures, a Surat-based PMS fund, feels it is a tough call.He told Moneycontrol that the capital goods, which recently came out of a long business downcycle sees a kind of improvement which is surprising even the promoters. “To what extent it can still surprise and what multiples market will be willing to pay is anyone’s guess,” Parikh said.The reason being that the profits many of these companies were reporting in a full year are now coming through in six months because of huge order wins, he said.Parikh’s fund owns companies like Praj Industries, Elicon Engineer, Apar Industries and TD Power.Given the unusually robust order book position, the stocks are quoting at multiples higher than those during the previous peak cycle in 2018.“Let's say we thought that 8 to 10 times EV/EBITDA is what Apar should trade because that was the peak in the previous cycle. It is now trading at 14 times,” Parikh said.Catching the topThe challenge in figuring out if the cycle has peaked is that earnings growth can continue to be strong for some more time as the backlog in the order book is still being executed. One indicator is to watch when profit margins hit historic highs. When that happens, stock prices usually stop reacting to incremental positive developments. But that indicator too has its limits, according to Parikh, as the trend varies across sectors.“If the entry barriers are low for the industry, it's very easy to set up capacity, and supply can come very fast. So, that is relatively easy to adjust. Let's say something like sugar, where you know it's not that difficult to divert the production or something of that sort.Or the BOPP films or BoPET films industry. You have a sense of how much capex has been announced and how much time it will take for the supply to come. For such industries, typically the demand is very linear.So, out there, you have comfort in comparing the historic margins or the previous cycle's high margins,” Parikh said.“But it can get tricky if the sector is one with high entry barriers. There you could see a time correction rather than a price correction. Say for instance, something that’s not exactly cyclical; Balaji Amines and Alkyl Amines. It is a oligopoly kind of market. But the stocks have stopped reacting for the last couple of years now, because margins had hit historic highs,” Parikh said.Watch the priceA tell tale sign that Parikh keeps an eye on is the stock price. “The relatively easy thing is to take feedback from the market because what will happen during an upcycle is that earnings will change, margins will change, and the ownership will change.If you combine all these things over time you will get a sense of how well markets priced a lot of things. And when even with good numbers if stocks stop reacting the way they used to in the past, you get a sense that there is over ownership in the sector. The story is well discovered, and it could be a prudent time to start trimming position,” Parikh said.Likewise, in a downcycle, the time to start buying when stock prices don’t react to bad numbers, as it is an indication that the outlook on the business is getting better.Order enquiriesParikh was early to latch on to the capital goods story and said the indicator he tracks closely is improvement in enquiry levels from clients. Managements usually mention that in their earnings calls.That allowed him to buy into stocks like Praj Industries and Triveni Engineering at attractive prices.“Those were the few companies which clearly mentioned that their enquiry levels were going higher by 30-50 percent,” said Parikh, who manages around Rs 450 crore.“A 10-15 percent increase in enquiries is quite normal. But the moment enquiries go up higher than that, you know things may be changing for the industry,” he said.Parikh cited the example of Praj Industries where the government’s announcement of the advancement of the deadline for ethanol blending did not immediately fire up the stock. But Parikh started building a position when he heard the management say the order enquiries were rising.Taking a callEven if the management say enquiries are rising, there is no saying if the enquiries will actually translate into orders. That’s where one needs to know the promoters’ track record.“Some companies are historically aggressive when it comes to such announcements. So you need to discount what percentage of that will actually translate into order wins. Then there are others who are conservative. If they mention a figure, you can assume that the conversion number will be high,” Parikh said.It’s the promoterBetting on the promoter is key because according to Parikh, the big losses usually come from company specific issues.“The business part typically any normal analyst can evaluate. But a capital loss typically happens when the promoters' intentions are not above the board. Whenever we look at an investment opportunity we also look at how promoters have behaved during a good cycle and a bad cycle, in addition to the standard quantitative filters,” Parikh said."

The 42-year-old co-founder of Surat-based PMS firm Molecule Ventures has been managing investments for over a decade now, initially for friends and family, and later for paying clients. The firm today manages around Rs 450 crore for a little over 200 clients since it got a Sebi registration in May 2021.Here's the excerpts from a freewheeling conversation:Warning signsThe quantity of shares is a good indicator of knowing whether the market is overbought or oversold.In January 2018, at the peak of the (mid and small cap) rally, the average daily shares traded was 46 crore. It fell to 20-25 crore during the bear market of 2019. During the Covid rally, it climbed a high of 100 crore in January 2022 as the market topped out temporarily. After consolidating between January 2022 and Match 2023, the number has been steadily rising and now stands at 145 crore.Junk indexThis volume needs to be viewed in the context of the kind of shares that are rising. We have internally come up with what we call a junk index. It has around 85 stocks with corporate governance issues, and which only participate in the fag-end of the bull market. In March (2023), around 10 percent of the stocks (in junk index) were rising. That number rose to around 40 percent by August. Today 100 percent of the basket is participating.Bearish on chemicalsWe were able to spot the chemical upcycle early in 2013 when companies across the board were expanding their capacities. Two things helped us make the decision. One, the capex was not being funded through equity dilution. Two, even if we were wrong in our call, the downside was limited because the stocks were available at cheap price-to-earnings multiples.What has changed The way it works for any sector is that the leader in the previous cycle will not participate in the subsequent cycle.One, the fundamental triggers would have played out to perfection, and the market would have priced these stocks fully. That is an important factor because the price you buy at will decide the returns you make.Also, a lot of OK kind of companies would have participated in the previous cycle, and many people would have got stuck when the cycle peaked. Say, you have 100 stocks in the chemicals sector. The main traction will happen in, let's say, 10, 15 stocks. That will be in line with a normal market scenario. So, they'll have earnings growth, normal multiples, and returns too will be normal. But because you have too many people owning the shares, every bounce will get sold into. It is the ownership that decides the extent of the move on either sides.Another thing that is different in this chemical cycle is that companies have lined up huge expansion plans, but this time a lot of funding is taking place through equity dilution."

The following two days gave insight that there is a long way to go for the infra and PSU companies, as expected, and lastly, cement companies are finally showing a bullish pattern after decades, and there can be 50 percent or more gains in many of them.

The influence of time and human responses are so predictive. We have always believed that the timing of action or execution of investment ideas is critical, as it can improve the performance of the fund or portfolio. TimeMap can reduce the portfolio's risk profile, minimise beta, and enhance the alpha of the fund or portfolio of the investors.The coming week will be volatile; the efficiency of the TimeMap is above 50 percent, which means the movement would be slightly above 3 percent.

Financial conditions loosen, posing concerns for Fed.","Is the equity rally getting too hot for the Federal Reserve? It’s an increasingly pressing question for Jerome Powell, after three months of gains put pressure on his efforts to keep screws on the economy tight.Fueled by uncertain bets that the central bank will embark on a protracted series of interest-rate cuts this year, the S&P 500 set fresh records in five straight sessions before Friday, extending an upward march that has added $8 trillion to shareholder value. Gains pushed a measure of financial conditions to the loosest since early 2022.Policy makers seldom say it out loud, but advances in equities — and the sense of affluence they induce across Wall Street and Main Street — have the potential to work against efforts to rein in inflation, by adding fresh fuel to the consumption and investment cycle. A study recently published on the National Bureau of Economic Research website called stocks the biggest influence on financial conditions and said swaying them is a crucial channel of monetary policy.While bulls would no doubt welcome dovish signals when the Fed meets next week, easing too soon is not without hazards. Among them: That markets boil over and the resulting economic wealth effect works against the Fed chair’s bid to squeeze out excess price pressures.“When you’re at full employment and then you watch a significant increase in stock market wealth, intuitively to me, that would be more inflationary,” said Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at Leuthold Group. “The stock market’s rally in anticipation of Fed rate cuts has been a form of easing in and of itself. That, ironically, could reduce the odds of rate cuts in coming months.”Up 1% over five days, the S&P 500 notched gains for the 12th time in 13 weeks. The ascent has led to a material easing in financial conditions, which measures tightness across money, bond and stock markets. In fact, the investment backdrop is more accommodative than before the central bank embarked on its aggressive policy-tightening almost two years ago — thanks in large part to the stock rally — according to Bloomberg indexes.With the focus shifting to lower rates ahead, the cost of funding for mortgages has dropped, luring home buyers. Share prices have reclaimed all-time highs, potentially providing a favorable impetus for consumer spending. Equity holdings by American households totaled $43 trillion in the third quarter, or 38% of their financial assets, according to the most recent Fed data available.Benign financial conditions and better-than-expected economic data pose a hurdle for the Fed in leaning toward a more dovish stance, according to Henry Allen, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. He recalls that in early 2023, when payrolls continued to hold up strong and inflation persisted, Powell in his congressional hearing said the central bank would be prepared to “increase the pace of rate hikes.”Additionally Powell has more than once, during the rate-hike cycle, highlighted the importance of overall financial conditions reflecting “the policy restraint that we’re putting in place.”“Clearly inflation is now much closer to target so that isn’t an exact parallel with today, but the risk is that easier financial conditions lay the foundations for inflation to re-accelerate,” Allen wrote in a note. “In the current cycle, the Fed have turned more hawkish again when financial conditions have eased.”That monetary policy plays a massive role in the fate of financial assets has become a famous investing axiom after the Fed repeatedly rushed to the market’s rescue in recent decades, from the 2008 crisis to last year’s regional banking turmoil. In the NBER paper titled Central Banks, Stock Markets, and the Real Economy, Ricardo Caballero of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Alp Simsek at Yale University presented a model that also highlights the lagged influence that asset prices exert on the economy.It cites a Fed paper that found just a 1% increase in equity prices tends to be associated with additional economic growth worth 2 basis points in the subsequent year and 4 basis points over the following two years.At the margin, the latest stock boom gives the Fed a reason to wait on material rate cuts ahead. But such decisions must account for a myriad of inputs, including other market developments pointing to restrictive financial conditions, such as an elevation in inflation-adjusted rates, Simsek said in an interview.“Definitely the Fed is in a difficult position and I can see the decision going either way,” he said, referring to the March meeting. “They might exert more caution, especially if they don’t want to revert that decision later on.”Still the wealth effect may have peaked, for now. Going by Wall Street strategist forecasts, the bull run in stocks will lose steam after the S&P 500 this week exceeded their average year-end target. At the same time, 61% of Americans have exposure to stocks, with wealthy households overwhelmingly dominating the ownership, according to a Gallup poll last year. That leaves many people’s fortunes untethered to near-term market moves.The counterpoint: If history is any guide, Americans’ equity wealth can keep expanding. Since the 1940s, there have been 13 other times when the S&P 500 fully recovered from a protracted slump, as it just did last week. In all those instances, the index continued to go up, climbing a median 29% over 19 months until an ultimate peak set in. Should this bull market match that median advance, that’d enrich stock owners by roughly $15 trillion.“When people are feeling happy with what’s happening to their portfolios, they tend to spend more. And the wealth effect certainly can be stimulative to economic activity,” said Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research Inc. “The risk is that the Fed goes from having a price inflation headache to having an asset inflation headache.”"

Domestic markets were still under pressure, especially because of poor numbers from a few major players. The Nifty index had a high near 21,750 before closing near 21,200 with a decent loss for the second consecutive week.During past sessions, the benchmark index Nifty found support at 21,150, which then led to a massive rise from there. Interestingly, the index has reversed from the support of a bullish Wolfe Wave formation. Based on the pattern, the index may revisit the 21,700–21,800 zone in the upcoming week if the recent low near 21,150 is not broken. In the worst-case scenario, we anticipate that the index will take support below 21,150, close to the 20,900 zone, where multiple supports are placed and the AB=CD pattern is completed.The 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average 44,570) of the Nifty Bank index has been retested, and we anticipate that this zone will serve as support in the upcoming sessions. Overall, we anticipate a strong rebound in the Nifty Bank index during the February 2024 derivative series if the 45,000–44,000 support holds.Here are three buy calls for short term:HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,435 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 8 percentSince the last 2 years or so, the said counter has been rejected six times from Rs 1,725–1,750 zone and is currently placed near Rs 1,430 mark. Currently, HDFC Bank has taken timely support near the October 2022 low of around Rs 1,380. Coincidentally, it is 200 DEMA, thus making it a viable buy at the current juncture.The fall from January 17, 2024, to January 23, 2024, has witnessed decreasing volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam. On January 24, 2024, HDFC Bank made a classic Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern accompanied by decent volume, which cannot be ignored as of now.Also, in the hourly time frame, it has managed to generate Bull divergence on stochastic. Based on the technical setup, one can accumulate the said counter in the range of Rs 1,420–1,450 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,380 and a target of Rs 1,550.Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 175.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 155 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 20 percentSince the last 2 months or so, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Recently, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative. Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable.Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines. The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars, which indicates bullish bias in the counter.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has given a trendline violation, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 170-176 with an upside target of Rs 210, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 155 on a daily close basis.Note: The Gartley pattern is a Harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, which help traders, identify reaction highs and lows.Greaves Cotton: Buy | LTP: Rs 165 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 200 | Return: 21 percentThe entire 2023 year went by, consolidating around 100–200 DEMA (exponential moving average), followed by recent bear trendline violations (refer to the chart). Also, volume is picking up from lower levels, thus making it attractive at current levels.On the indicator front, the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has given a bull cross just near the zero line, which further affirms our bullish stance. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 163–166 with a target of Rs 200 and a stop-loss of Rs 143 on a daily basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

On the downside, the 21,240–21,220 zone acted as a support zone where the 40-day moving average is placed. Thus, the Nifty is consolidating within these two parameters. A breach of this range shall lead to a move in that direction. The hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover which is a buy signal and hence there can be a minor degree bounce up to 21,520–21,550 before it resumes the next leg of the fall.Bank Nifty has witnessed a sharp pullback from intraday lows though closed marginally in the red.

Analysts anticipate continued attention on this sector in the FY25 budget.Although the upcoming budget is an interim one, it is expected to lay the groundwork for future policy decisions. Most brokerages anticipate a focus on fiscal consolidation and priorities regarding capital and non-capital expenditure.Also read: Thermal power plants' capacity utilisation to rise to 69% in FY'25: ICRA""We anticipate the policy direction and priorities to align closely with recent budgets, as the government navigates between fostering growth recovery and managing challenging debt dynamics,"" Elara Capital said in a recent report.Additional momentumAccording to a pre-budget report from Axis Securities, the power sector is expected to gain additional momentum in the interim budget. It cites the government's heightened focus on expanding the utilisation of renewable energy as a top priority.The report specifically highlights the inclusion of further details about the recently launched Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana, a scheme to make electricity affordable and make India self-reliant in power.Anticipated announcements in the interim budget include higher capital expenditure for renewable energy, incentives for green initiatives, and production-linked incentives (PLIs) for solar module manufacturing.Additionally, the report suggests expectations for dynamic feed-in tariffs, grid modernisation to better integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and capital spending on battery storage infrastructure. Other anticipated measures include a potential reduction in customs duty on solar cells to 5 percent from 25 percent and an extension of the waiver on inter-state transmission system charges for renewable projects commissioned beyond June 2025.Also read: Union Budget 2024: Gender budgeting in energy schemes is a sure path to equitable, women-led developmentSagar Lele, co-founder of Rupeeting, is betting on the power growth story and expects more push on renewable energy, with a focus on incentives for module manufacturing and building an ecosystem for renewable energy.“The overall direction will be to ensure that there is capacity so that demand is fulfilled, whether that is thermal or renewable. And on the 2030 goals, whether it is solar, wind, or green hydrogen, the goal will be to get some policy initiatives in place to build the ecosystem to facilitate our targets,” he said.Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates that the government may also focus on indigenous energy storage technology development and renewable power supply, which should address energy security and material sustainability.“There should be sufficient allocation in decentralised renewable energy and energy access to make it mainstream to the country's green growth,” it said.Power sector viewLele is positive about the power sector given the investment amounts, government reforms, and measures being taken to overcome the power deficit, such as extending Section 11 of the Electricity Act, under which the government can ask power-generating companies to override guidelines under extraordinary circumstances to maintain output.The government has added 194,394 MW of generation capacity in the past nine years, the ministry of power said on January 2. The present installed capacity of power generation is about 426,132 MW. Of the generation capacity of 9,943 MW added in the FY24, about 1,674 MW was based on fossil fuel sources and 8,269 MW on renewable energy, the ministry said.IIFL Securities analysts said recent comments by the power ministry suggest the government is looking at stepping up coal-based capacity addition to meet rising demand.“This is in addition to the more than 350GW RE capacity addition that the government has envisaged by 2032. And to that extent, the entire sector offers a significant runway for growth over the next 8-10 years,” the analysts said.In the renewable space, according to a November 2023 Kotak Institutional Equities report, the government is targeting 500 GW of renewable capacity by FY30 and has improved renewable auctioning from ~15 GW annual run-rate to 20 GW for YTD FY24, with plans to achieve 50 GW of annual auctions for the remainder of FY24. It added that while key players have lined up plans to set up renewable energy capacities, execution has been patchy so far.Analysts estimate power capex to continue to grow over the next 2-3 years. In a September 2023 Jefferies report, analysts said power capex should grow 9x at a CAGR of 20 percent during FY23-26, up from 2.2 percent during FY10-20.As India enters a phase of capex-driven GDP growth, Jefferies said power intensity should rise.“We expect annual thermal PLFs to cross 80 percent by FY2025E, above a two-decade peak. Power generation and T&D investments should rise 2.2x to $280 billion in FY24E-30E vs. FY2017-2023,” it said.Power stocks to track before and after Budget 2024With the interim budget expectations, stocks with renewable energy capability are expected to make some gains during and after the budget.Analysts at JM Financial said in a recent report that they are positive on growth opportunities for the NHPC stock as it is one of the largest hydropower-generating utilities in the country with an aggregate installed capacity of 7,071 MW. This is 15 percent of India’s installed hydropower capacity.“With 10,515 MW of projects under construction (hydro and renewables), the company’s installed capacity with regulated return is set to grow by 3,420 MW by FY2026, up by 50 percent after a gap of 3 years, resulting in revenue growth of 20 percent and a net profit CAGR of 11 percent over FY23–26E,"" the analysts said in the report. NHPC is also the “only large utility with a 100 percent green energy portfolio,” they said.While NHPC’s Q2 results missed estimates on account of lower generation due to lower water levels in reservoirs and flash floods in Himachal Pradesh, Elara analysts remain positive on the stock due to visibility from ongoing projects.NHPC has 15 projects (hydro and solar) of 10,449 MW under construction, including two units of the 8x250 MW Subansiri project that are expected to be commissioned in Q4, two units of 4x200 MW Parbati-II in early FY25, and the remaining units progressively by Q2 of FY25.In the private sector, Tata Power is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with a clean energy portfolio of 5,500 MW, which includes solar, wind, and hydropower.“The company plans to achieve 70 percent clean power generation by FY30 and plans to meet this target by installing between 1.5 and 2 GW of renewable energy annually. By FY2027, the company plans to incur a capex of Rs 60,000 crore, with around 45 percent of the capex being spent on renewable projects,” Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said in a report.Recently, the management of Power Grid Corporation of India increased its FY24 capex target to Rs 10,000 crore from Rs 8,800 crore. Analysts estimate the capex will move up due to the spending of Rs 12,500 crore and capitalisation of Rs 17,000 crore for FY25.“Longer term, the company has a Rs 1.9 lakh crore capex plan for the next decade that includes around Rs 1.7 lakh crore for transmission infrastructure, Rs 0.1 crore for solar generation, Rs 0.15 crore for smart metering infrastructure, and Rs 0.10 crore for the data centre business,” BoB Capital said in a report.BoB Capital values the company at 2.1x. According to the report, Power Grid warrants a higher valuation due to “its superior ROE of 15-19 percent, high 5.6 percent dividend yield in FY2023, and lowest risk profile in the power sector.""NTPC currently accounted for 17 percent of India’s installed capacity and 25 percent of the total power generation in FY23. According to analysts at Axis Securities, NTPC's substantial portfolio in conventional power, with a firm cost-plus business model, positions it well in a growing peak power cycle.“This structure contributes to stable cash flows and will facilitate growth led by renewable energy,” Axis said.NTPC has around 10 GW of thermal capacity under construction, which is expected to be commissioned by FY26. NTPC has a target of 60 GW of renewable capacity by FY32, up from the current 3.3 GW.Analysts estimate that until the elections, there may not be a slowdown in sentiment or stock price. Over the past year, stocks in the segment have seen healthy gains, with NTPC and NHPC shares gaining over 90 percent, recently listed IREDA with almost 2x returns, and SJVN with about 3x returns.IIFL Securities analyst said power capex, particularly generation, has a multiplier effect and will likely trigger a decadal long investment cycle, making the segment and associated companies a compelling play.“We note that the power sector’s weight in the overall market is near multi-year lows, and has tremendous scope to improve with the expected investments planned to meet the rising demand,” the analysts said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

In the last one year, the Nifty Auto index zoomed 43 per cent, ahead of the benchmark Nifty 50 that returned about 19 per cent. Auto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been spewing out strong sales numbers month after month, underscoring sustained demand. Adding to this are tailwinds from news around product launches and benign raw material prices that have lifted profit margins, after some painful quarters last year.December quarter results of two leading OEMs – Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd- beat expectations on the Street. Double-digit revenue growth compared to the year-ago period and about a 100 basis-points (bps) operating margin expansion justified the narrative of sustained earnings growth. But all this optimism seems to be baked into the respective stock prices. Why the present valuations look elevated is highlighted in MC Pro’s Research team analysis here and here.Over the next few days, more auto OEMs such as Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors are expected to declare their results that are likely to follow a similar trend- strong earnings growth baked into valuations.To be sure, Nifty auto index valuations have come off slightly in the last couple of weeks on reports of demand moderation in some segments such as passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. Tractors too seen to be going through the cyclical downturn. The high base will affect growth for these segments in the next couple of years.A recent report by BNP Paribas on the Indian automotive landscape highlights reasons why it expects demand growth to moderate to single-digits across the sector over FY2025-26. Economic recovery has not been broad based, which raises concerns on sustaining the strong automotive demand growth. It cites specific reasons such as concerns of K-shaped recovery looming still along with fears of unemployment along with missing real rural wage growth. Meanwhile, news on exports is not comforting enough to offset slowing domestic demand.In other words, it may be prudent for investors to moderate earnings growth expectations from the auto pack. Of course, the Interim Budget ahead of general elections may sprinkle some incentives/subsidies, particularly for rural areas, that may make positive headlines and drive up overall investor sentiment.Auto companies’ strategies to boost demand through new launches and refreshes in the absence of strong underlying success is likely to meet with limited success. Also, the noise around electric vehicles including the expected Ola Electric IPO may help keep investor interest in auto stocks elevated.Investing insights from our research teamTech Mahindra Q3 FY24 – A mixed bag, staring at a reset with the ongoing restructuringWhy 2024 can be the year of bond revivalJSW Energy: Riding ahead of its earnings growthPidilite Industries Q3: Growth stalling, margin strengtheningHavells India Q3: Slow and steadyLaurus Labs: CDMO ramp-up has some runway ahead before it fliesWhat else are we reading?Markets Near Peaks: Should investors book profits or hold?MC Pro Quicktake | Bajaj Auto: Two-wheeler sales rev up to boost Q3 profitsMC Pro Quicktake: Tech Mahindra’s Q3 results hold out hope for investorsZee Entertainment: Can a new cast revive the merger script?Union Budget 2024: Government must focus on capex, fiscal prudence to drive growthBudget Snapshot: Cement supply uptick may keep prices in checkTata Steel Q3: China’s shadow looms over the industry’s profitabilityThe Ram temple and other projects of national rejuvenationColder-for-Longer: Fintechs must realise that the time for reckoning is nighStart-up Street: Follow-on funding challenges for Indian start-upsBiden’s green spending splurge is a hard model to copy (republished from the FT)Maldives could be China’s revenge against India outsmarting it in Bhutan and NepalMacron’s visit reaffirms India’s unique and trusted partnership with FranceMusk waves goodbye to Tesla’s growth targetsPlastic bag bans have failed in every way except oneImpact of Union Budget on the stock market in three chartsIf Congress-TMC talks collapse, who will it benefit in Bengal?Hedge funds are playing a dangerous game on Japan and ChinaPersonal FinanceDCB Happy Savings Account offers cashback on UPI transactions: Should you open one?Tech and StartupsGenerative AI will go mainstream over the next 2-3 years: Persistent Systems CEO Sandeep KalraTechnical Picks: HDFC Bank, Vedanta, Hind Copper and Astral (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Vatsala KamatMoneycontrol Pro"

Despite these uncertainties, market analysts remain optimistic about the company's prospects, eagerly expecting insights into the turnaround strategy from the newly appointed CEO, Mohit Joshi, for the medium-term.Over the last twelve months, the stock of this IT services company has experienced a notable surge, recording a growth of over 31 percent. This outperforms the broader Nifty IT index, which witnessed a comparatively modest rise of 23 percent during the same period.Street awaits new CEO Mohit Joshi's turnaround strategyAnalysts at Nomura shared a 'buy' call for Tech Mahindra, with a target price of Rs 1,470 per share from last close of Rs 1,407, saying that the Q3 financials were above estimates on growth and margins were in-line with their expectations. The brokerage firm awaits full details of new CEO's turnaround strategy in April 2024.This is the first quarter since new CEO Joshi completely took over reins of the company from former CEO CP Gurnani. Joshi restructured the organisation and the leadership team to turnaround the business, which came into effect on January 1, 2024.ALSO READ: Inside Tech Mahindra’s restructuring game plan""The quarter was a mixed outcome.

The counters are also different. The ones beaten down most have low FPI ownership,"" said Nirav Karkera, head of research, Fisdom.Also Read: MC Explains | What are Sebi FPI norms and how are they linked to the market fall?Sebi initially estimated that the quantum of FPI stake that will have to comply with additional disclosure norms at around Rs 2.46 lakh crore. Sources at Sebi, however, told Moneycontrol that the amount was a conservative estimate. The amount was now significantly lower despite a significant escalation in the market’s overall market-cap, as more FPIs got eliminated on additional exemption criteria.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, said Sebi norms could be one of the triggers but one must also note that FIIs were selling across emerging markets (EMs).""The global FII view is to reduce exposure to EM equities, maybe because they feel markets are overvalued. India is also at the receiving end,"" he said.During the January 15-23 period, the Nifty lost 4 percent and the Nifty Midcap 100 2.5 percent. FIIs pulled out Rs 32,000 crore and DIIs bought stake worth Rs 17,000 crore.After a very strong rally and the Nifty scaling 22,000, the markets had moved to an overbought situation and needed an excuse to pullback a bit, Gaurav Dua, SVP - Head Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan told Moneycontrol.""The volatility in global markets and the post results correction in some heavyweights in banking sector seem to have provided the required trigger for the correction. The reports related to FPI norms seem to have only added to weakness in sentiments,"" Dua said.Stock-specific triggersMuch of the market fall has been triggered by negative news about specific stocks. Zee Entertainment Enterprises, for instance, saw a 38 percent drawdown largely on the back of the Sony deal fallout. Data compiled by Prime Database shows only two FPIs holding more than 50 percent of their corpus in Essel group, which amounts to total of Rs 63 crore. Zee's total market cap loss over this period is more than Rs 7,000 crore.In the case of HDFC, two FPIs have concentrated holdings — Aberdeen and Invesco — amounting to Rs 18,210 crore. Both are exempt from making additional disclosures, as per Sebi. HDFC Bank has fallen close to 15 percent after it announced its third quarter results as the Street was disappointed with its margin performance.Also Read: Expect some housing incentives in Budget, prefer private over PSU banks: Macquarie’s Suresh GanapathyOberoi Realty, which does not have concentrated FPI holding, has tumbled 10 percent in the past weak after its December quarter net profit tanked close to 49 percent from last year. On the other hand, Adani group companies that have highest amount of concentrated FPI bets have fallen between 2 and 5 percent.For several stocks, one cannot make a direct connection between concentrated FPI holding and the recent selloff. That said, the numbers could be an under representation of opaque structures as they include only FPIs with greater than 1 percent holding. Data for this study was compiled by Prime database, based on public disclosures.What are Sebi FPI norms and what are the deadlines?Sebi wants additional disclosures from FPIs to prevent companies from manipulating the rules on minimum public shareholding and also to prevent overseas entities from indirectly controlling Indian companies through a chain or web of shell firms.Disclosures on beneficial ownership have to be made by FPIs whose 50 percent of equity assets under management are invested in a single Indian corporate group, or FPIs that have invested over Rs 25,000 crore in the Indian stock market.Sources on January 24 said there is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings.Also Read: Sebi FPI norms: Quantum less than projected, no immediate deadline to liquidate, say sourcesFPIs which meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of October 31, 2023 have time till January-end to rebalance their holdings, if they so wish. ""If they continue to meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of January end, they shall be required to make the additional disclosures within 30 trading days,"" sources said.Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they will have another six months to reduce their holdings."

Also, the correction from the recent top Rs 248 had very thin volume, which hints that bears are losing steam. In previous trading sessions, the said counter has gained momentum, which is looking lucrative.On indicator, hourly scale stochastics has managed to make bullish divergence, which further confirms the bullish stance in the counter. Thus, we advise going long in the range of Rs 230–238 with an upside target of Rs 265 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 219 on a daily close basis.Dr Reddy's LaboratoriesSince the last few months, the counter has been respecting Rs 5,500 levels. Also, the correction from the recent top Rs 5,970 had very thin volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam.In previous trading sessions, the said counter has gained momentum by clocking 4 percent gains, which is looking lucrative. On indicator, daily scale stochastics has managed to make bullish hidden divergence, which further confirms the bullish stance in the counter. Thus, we advise going long in the range of Rs 5,850-6,000 with an upside target of Rs 6,350 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 5,699 on a daily close basis.Note: Hidden Bullish Divergence is Once price makes a higher low (HL), look and see if the oscillator (stochastics in our case) does the same. If it doesn’t and makes a lower low (LL), then we’ve got some hidden divergence in our hands.Borosil RenewablesJanuary 2024 has been fabulous for the said counter as it has already given 38 percent return in just one month time. Having said that still lot of upside potential is seen. On monthly time frame it has taken out previous 7 months candle. Also, volume is very huge from lower levels which is making it as a lucrative buy.On Indicator front, monthly stochastics has given bull cross just above oversold zone which further confirms bullish stance in the counter. Thus, one can buy in small tranche in the range of Rs 590-615 and another tranche in the range of Rs 550-560 (if tested) for upside target of Rs 750 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 499 on daily close basis.

The strong APE growth, coupled with steady margins, may lift the value of new business (VNB) - the profitability metric - by 13 percent YoY during the fiscal third quarter.India's third biggest life insurer is scheduled to announce Q3 results on January 25.According to an average estimate of five brokerages, SBI Life's APE is expected to come in at Rs 5,963 crore in Q3FY24 as compared to Rs 5,430 crore in Q3FY23. APE essentially measures life insurer's new business value written during the quarter.On the other hand, VNB is expected to be at Rs 1,702 crore in Q3FY24 as against Rs 1,150 crore in the year-ago period, according to the average estimates. VNB assesses present value of future profits associated with new business written during the quarter for a life insurer.ALSO READ: Union Budget 2024: Life insurers want tax-free annuity income, term insurance benefit under new regimeA healthy growth in SBI Life's VNB is also expected to help expand VNB margins by 84 basis points (bps) to 28.64 percent in Q3FY24, compared to 27.8 percent in Q3FY23.Gross premium income is expected to grow two percent YoY in Q3FY24, said analysts at Motilal Oswal. The firm’s first year premium will likely fall eight percent YoY, renewal premium will grow seven percent YoY, and single premium will clock a whopping 35 percent YoY growth.Some of the key factors to watch in the SBI Life's Q3 performance would be management’s commentary on product mix, outlook on VNB margin, and if there is any expected change in commissions payable to SBI.Further, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said that clarity on proposed insurance regulatory development authority (IRDA) guidelines on surrender penalty caps would be a key watch out. ""We need clarity on the final guidelines, estimated impact and the strategies to be adopted by life insurance companies thereon,"" they said.The cap on surrender penalty will limit the charges imposed on policyholders after they voluntarily terminate an insurance policy before its maturity period. In this manner, a policyholder would receive a higher premium for the insurance they paid and surrender charges would be waived off. This, analysts believe, could take a toll on insurance companies margins.In the October-December period, SBI Life shares surged over nine percent as compared to nine percent rise in the benchmark Sensex. On a yearly basis, the stock of this life insurer gained eight percent, underperforming Sensex, which jumped by 15 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

That took precedence for investors over the company’s profit, which fell short of analysts’ forecasts.Also helping to bolster tech stocks was ASML, the Dutch company that’s a major supplier to the semiconductor industry. It reported stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected, and its U.S.-listed stock jumped 7.4%.Stocks have broadly rocketed to records recently on hopes that cooling inflation will convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates several times this year. Treasury yields have already come down considerably on such expectations, which can relax the pressure on the economy and financial system.The only question on Wall Street is when the Fed would begin cutting rates and how deeply it would go. Traders have recently been trimming their bets following stronger-than-expected reports on the economy, which keep worries about a recession at bay but could also add upward pressure on inflation.The latest signal of economic strength arrived Wednesday morning, when a preliminary report suggested growth in output for businesses accelerated to a seven-month high. Perhaps more importantly for Fed officials, the flash report from S&P Global also said that prices charged by businesses rose at the slowest rate since May 2020.The report did include some negative signals, such as delays in deliveries of supplies because of bad weather, ""but for now the survey send a clear and welcome message of resilient economic growth and sharply waning inflation,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.Treasury yields in the bond market pared earlier losses following the report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.12% from 4.14% late Tuesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.33% from 4.38%.Economic reports coming later in the week could further sway expectations for rate cuts this year. On Thursday, the government will give its first update for how quickly the economy grew during the final three months of 2023. A day later, it will give the latest monthly update on the measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve prefers to use.Virtually no one expects the Fed to cut rates at its meeting next week, but traders are still betting on a better than 50% probability that it will move in March, according to data from CME Group.Until then, earnings reports from companies are causing some of the biggest moves.Elevance Health climbed 2.9% after it reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that squeaked past analysts’ expectations. Kimberly-Clark fell 4.7% after the maker of Huggies and Kleenex reported weaker profit and revenue than expected. DuPont tumbled 14.1% after it gave forecasts for upcoming revenue and profit that fell well short of analysts’ estimates. It said it’s continuing to see weak demand form China, among other challenges.China's stock market has been one of the world's worst recently on worries about its economy, which has raised pressure on Chinese authorities to make moves to stimulate the economy. Stocks climbed 1.8% in Shanghai following China's move to free up cash held by banks. They're still down 5.2% for the year so far."

If that happens then Chinese steel companies will be able to sell a good quantity of their production locally, instead of dumping them in international markets.For the last many months, global steel prices have been subdued, due to a combination of weak demand as well dumping by China. Weak global prices hurt exports for Indian steel makers.“Chinese steel companies have not been cutting production despite weaker demand. They have only cut it in the second half of the last year despite the losses. If the economic reforms lead to a revival in the real estate and infrastructure sector, then Chinese exports will come off aiding steel pricing across the globe and in turn helping domestic steel companies.” said Tushar Chaudhari, Lead Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher.Pan Gongsheng, People’s Bank of China governor said the banks will cut the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percent on February 5, which will provide $139 billion in liquidity to the economy, according to a Bloomberg report.According to a Prabhuadas report, domestic demand for steel companies is expected to slow down in Q3 due to moderation in infrastructure spending due to election, hence competitive exports gave a good advantage to these companies.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The most popular one doing the rounds is selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPI) to comply with Sebi's additional disclosure norms.What are these norms and why has the regulator put them in place? We break it down for you in this edition of MC Explains:What does Sebi want from FPIs?Sebi wants additional disclosures from FPIs to prevent companies from manipulating the rules on minimum public shareholding, and also to prevent overseas entities from indirectly controlling Indian companies through a chain or web of shell firms.Also read: Sebi FPI norms: Quantum less than projected, no immediate deadline to liquidate, say sourcesWhat additional disclosures?FPIs need to give full details of all holders of ownership, economic, and control rights. This will help in identification of ultimate beneficial ownership.Do all FPIs have to make these additional disclosures?No. Disclosures have to be made by FPIs whose 50 percent of equity assets under management are invested in a single Indian corporate group, or FPIs that have invested over Rs 25,000 crore in the Indian stock market.Who are exempt from making additional disclosures?Sovereign wealth funds, listed companies on certain global exchanges, public retail funds, and other regulated pooled investment vehicles with diversified global holdings.Also read: Did the Sebi FPI ownership norm cause the market to fall What are the risks of concentrated FPI investments?Concentrated investments raise the concern and possibility that promoters of such corporate groups are acting in concert with FPIs. Sebi observed that in some instances, promoters were holding more than the stipulated 75 percent by parking their shares with FPIs friendly to them.""If this were the case, the apparent free float in a listed company may not be its true free float, increasing the risk of price manipulation in such scrips,"" Sebi had said.What is the quantum of FPI AUM that need to make additional disclosures?Back in March 2023, Sebi's first estimate was Rs 2.6 lakh crore. Now, sources say that it is much lower, despite a run-up in the markets over the past one year.Also read: Tatas, Hindujas among 40 groups with concentrated FPI holdings. Here’s the listWhat is the deadline to make such disclosures?In October 2023, Sebi finalised the standard operating procedure (SOP) for custodians to follow for enhanced disclosures. Existing FPIs, which were in breach of the investment limits as on October 31, 2023, were required to bring down such exposure within 90 calendar days i.e. January 29, 2024. They are required to do this only if they wish to do so.In case of genuine FPIs, unable to bring down the equity AUM below the prescribed thresholds within the timelines, they shall be required to make the additional disclosures within 30 trading days from 29th January 2024 i.e. by March 11, 2024.Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they would have a further six months to reduce their holdings.What does it have to do with the market fall?Over the past one week, Nifty and Sensex fell close to 4 percent and many reports attributed this to FPIs adjusting their portfolios before the January 31 deadline.Is that really the reason?Hard to say. It is unlikely that FPIs waited till last minute to adjust portfolios. Foreign investors have sold equities worth Rs 27,830.34 crore over the past one week, much lower than Sebi's initial estimate.Genuine FPIs would not have any issue in disclosing granular details and would sell stake due to stock-specific reasons rather than to simply comply with the threshold norms."

Earlier, Axis Bank shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,151 each on December 5, 2023.Analysts see credit profile improvingAnalysts at Jefferies shared a 'buy' call on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,380 per share as against the last close of Rs 1,088. While Q3 profit was a little below their estimates due to weaker NII or net interest margins (NIMs), analysts still believe that the franchise is strong enough to deliver 16-18 percent growth in loans going ahead.""We could also see improvement in deposit profile that would sustain the return on equity (RoE) of 18 percent. We see a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17 percent over FY24-26. At valuations of 1.8x FY25 adjusted PB/10x PE are attractive and 20 percent discount to ICICI Bank,"" the brokerage firm added.HSBC analysts, too, remained bullish on the lender, sharing a target price of Rs 1,404 per share but cut FY24-26 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 0.3-1.5 percent. ""The EPS cut reflects minor adjustments to growth, NIM, and operating expenditure estimates.

The brokerage firm downgraded its rating on Axis Bank to 'neutral' with a target price of Rs 1,175 per share.Moreover, the management commentary suggested that margin pressure is likely to continue till Q1FY25 due to deposit repricing but the pace of increase will temper down.Elevated CD ratio may limit credit growthThe lender's loans grew 23 percent on-year in Q3FY24, led by the retail segment. Deposits, on the other hand, climbed by 18 percent on-year during the quarter.As a result, its credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio turned to be elevated at 93 percent as against RBI's comfortable range of 70-80 percent. This, analysts believe will limit credit growth going ahead.""We will keep an eye on the near-term growth as an elevated CD ratio will constrain credit growth, while continued re-pricing of deposits will likely exert pressure on margins in the coming quarters. The bank has a healthy LCR of 118 percent as it maintains industry best outflow rates. However, the impact of a surge in non-retail deposits will need to be watched over the coming quarters,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Analysts foresee a 6% dip in standalone volumes due to a seasonally weak quarter, coupled with a 1% sequential rise in blended realizations amid higher domestic steel prices.","JSW Steel Ltd is expected to report a 45 percent quarter-on-quarter decline in net profit for the December 2023 quarter because of reduced volume and increased operating costs.The company is expected to report a net profit of Rs 3,556 crore for the third quarter of FY24. A year-on-year comparison of the bottomline is not applicable because it had reported a loss in the same quarter last year. Its net sales is projected at Rs 44,799.60 crore, down 18 percent QoQ and 13 percent YoY, according to estimates from seven analysts.Standalone volumes are likely to decline 6 percent primarily on account of a seasonally weak quarter. Blended realisations may rise 1 percent sequentially due to higher steel prices in the domestic market. However, with increased coking coal and iron ore prices, standalone EBITDA per tonne is likely to decrease by 14 percent QoQ to Rs 11,000 per tonne in 3QFY24.Analysts also anticipate international operations to post an EBITDA loss during the quarter on the back of a sharp decline in global steel spreads.Yes Securities anticipates a Q3FY24 performance similar to Q2FY24 for JSW Steel. The coking coal impact is estimated to be around $30 per tonne for JSW Steel's Indian operations. Moreover, the expectation is for the topline growth to remain relatively flat.ICICI Securities anticipates a 5 percent QoQ increase in India business volume, with improved margins due to positive price-cost effects. However, subsidiary performance is expected to remain subdued. Coated products may be affected by a lower CRC-HRC spread, and US subsidiaries could incur inventory-related losses amid falling HRC prices.According to analysts, the Chinese property market struggles to recover despite government stimulus, while robust demand persists in the automotive sector. Overall, subdued demand in China and increased exports at competitive prices continue to impact domestic realisations. Monitoring the resurgence of Chinese demand and the resumption of Indian exports are key considerations moving forward.Recently, JSW Steel reported consolidated crude steel production of 6.87 million tonnes for Q3 FY24, marking an 8 percent increase over the previous quarter and a 12 percent rise on-year. The surge in infrastructure projects drove metal demand. Indian operations operated at 94 percent capacity in Q3. In India, crude steel production rose by 9 percent YoY to 6.63 million tonnes. For the US-Ohio operations, there was a 191 percent YoY increase to 0.24 million tonnes, with a sequential rise of 76 percent compared to Q2 FY24. The growth aligns with Crisil's projection of 11-13 percent YoY growth for India's steel sector in the current fiscal year.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The stock has formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily charts and saw healthy volumes, while trading above all key moving averages.Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Sun Pharmaceutical IndustriesOverall Pharma sector has continued to outperform since many weeks. Sun Pharma made a fresh record high in the previous session. The stock continued to rise despite of broader markets falling.On the below chart, we can see prices have broken above the upward sloping channel and shown strong positive momentum. The overall trend for the stock is positive unless we see close below the 50-day moving average which is near Rs 1,280 levels.In short, trend for Sun Pharma is positive. Use buy on dips approach to ride the trend with the target of Rs 1,480 levels. While on the downside Rs 1,280 is the crucial support level.Chalet HotelsChalet Hotels has continued to show strong rise since May 2023. Prices are still gaining momentum and is not showing any slow down as can be seen from RSI (relative strength index).As shown on daily chart we can see strong breakout above the channel and after retest there is again attempt to move higher. Break above yesterday’s high near Rs 775, the up move can resume in this stock for a move to Rs 810 levels. On downside, channel support is near Rs 710 levels.HDFC BankHDFC Bank has shown a sharp fall post the disappointing quarterly results. Since then not a single candle has given a close above previous day’s high which suggests weakness.On the below chart, the red vernicle lines represent 53 days’ cycle. We can see most of the lows are formed on our cycle and after almost every 53 period, HDFC Bank has shown a positive reversal. Currently, Time cycle of 53 days is due by January 25. So, post January 25, we can expect some buying.However, price action is a must to confirm the same and for that we need a close above Rs 1,475 levels. A close above it can suggest that short term bottom has formed.In short, trend for this stock is still negative. Any break below Rs 1,400 can drag the price lower towards Rs 1,340 levels. Whereas a close above Rs 1,475 can result into a short covering which can lift the price higher towards Rs 1,520-1,530 levels.Follow Ashish Kyal on Twitter - @kyalashishDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It is likely to test the 50 DMA of 21,000, while 20,800 is the next support level.Therefore, we can expect some pullbacks from 21,000–20,800 area. On the upside, 21,500 will be an immediate hurdle, while 20-DMA round 21,700 will remain a key challenge.The Bank Nifty is a key laggard where it rejected its 50 DMA and slipped below its 100 DMA. The 200 DMA of around 44,650 will be a critical support where we can expect a buying interest.While below 200 DMA, it may further weaken. On the upside, 45,500 will be an immediate hurdle, while 46,500 will be the key resistance at any pullback rally.Here are three buy calls for short term:Zydus Lifesciences: Buy | LTP: Rs 729 | Stop-Loss: Rs 680 | Target: Rs 800 | Return: 10 percentThe structure of the counter is bullish, as it has witnessed a breakout of long consolidation formation with huge volume on the daily chart, while on the weekly chart, it has given a breakout of a Cup and Handle pattern. It is coming out of a long consolidation range with a triangle formation breakout on the weekly chart.It is trading above its all-important moving averages, with higher highs and higher low formations. On the upside, Rs 750 is the immediate horizontal resistance; above this, we can expect Rs 800+ levels in the near term. On the downside, Rs 680 will be taken as important support during any correction.Anand Rathi Wealth: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,802 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,500 | Target: Rs 3,134 | Return: 12 percentLooking at the extended timeframe, the stock is displaying conventional bullish momentum by establishing higher highs and higher lows. In the shorter term, it broke out of a prolonged consolidation pattern with substantial trading volume. The stock's structure appears promising as it is currently trading above all significant moving averages.The momentum indicators signal positive trends, with the relative strength index (RSI) showing a favorable position, and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) experiencing an upward crossover at the centerline.On the upside, the key psychological level of Rs 3,000 holds significance. If surpassed, there is potential for the stock to reach Rs 3,100 or higher in the near to short term. Conversely, on the downside, Rs 2,500 is expected to provide strong support in case of any corrections.Global Health: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,130 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 | Target: Rs 1,244 | Return: 10 percentThe counter is in a classical uptrend and now it is breaking out of a triangle formation to resume its uptrend. The breakout coincides with rising volume and it manages to sustain above breakout level despite weakness in the broader market.It is trading above its all-important moving averages with a positive bias in momentum indicators. On the downside, a cluster of moving averages around the Rs 1,050 levels will act as a strong support level.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It fears that in the next season, higher production and a cap on diverting cane for ethanol could hit lead to a price slump","Sugar companies were trading down on January 23 after the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said the sweetener production was down compared to the previous year.Sugar production in the current marketing year, till January 15, was 149.52 lakh tons against 157.87 lakh tons in the year-ago period.The sugar marketing year runs from October to September.At 1.35 pm, Shree Renuka Sugars, the most valued sugar manufacturer, was down about 2 percent. Balrampur Chini Mills, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, Dalmia Sugar, Dhampur Sugar and DCM Shriram Industries were down up to 4 percent.According to reports, ISMA said the recent weather has been favourable for the standing cane crop. Cane commissioners of major producers such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka had revised their sugar production estimates for 2023-24 by 5-10 percent each.“We also believe that sugar production in the current year could be higher than what was expected earlier. Accordingly, ISMA has requested the government to allow additional 10-12 lakh tons of sugar diversion towards ethanol production,” the association said.Even after allowing additional sugar for production of ethanol, closing balance should be sufficient to cater a couple of months into the next season, it added.In December, the government allowed – after banning briefly – use of sugarcane juice as well as B-heavy molasses to produce ethanol but capped the diversion of sugar at 17 lakh tons. The cap will stay for the 2023-24 supply year that ends in September.The ban had come as sugar prices inched up and there were production concerns as well.Also read: Sugar mills face another hit from higher UP sugarcane costHigher sugarcane supply, along with the cap, will likely mean more sugar production, which will bring the price down, resulting in lower revenue for mills.The government recently announced incentives for ethanol made from maize. ISMA, however, argued that since the cane crop was more efficient in terms of water, nutrients and land use, it should get more support from the government.Also read: Sugar stocks turn bitter as govt steps in to check prices; analysts say worries overratedIt sought higher procurement cost for ethanol produced from cane juice, syrup, B-heavy molasses and C-heavy molasses for the sugar year 2023-24.The C-heavy molasses is a by-product of the sugar refining process which is has very little sugar content.

Steel production at 5.32 MT, up 6% YoY/QoQ, suggests inventory buildup.","Tata Steel Ltd is expected to see a sequential dip in net profit for the December 2023 quarter, primarily attributed to challenges in European operations, according to analysts. The company will report its earnings on January 24.The average of estimates by seven analysts polled by Moneycontrol suggests a consolidated net profit of Rs 702.70 crore, reflecting a 16 percent decline from the previous quarter. In the December 2022 quarter, the company reported a loss of around Rs 2384 crore.Consolidated revenue for the quarter is pegged at Rs 56,400.50 crore, with a 1.3 percent on-quarter increase driven by higher sales realisation in Indian operations and increased sales volume in India. However, this is partially offset by lower sales volume and realisation in Europe. Year-on-year (YoY) revenue is likely to decline by 1.2 percent.Analysts foresee a 3.5 percent QoQ decline in EBITDA, driven by reduced EBITDA per tonne in India due to higher coking coal costs. Despite increased realisation and sales volume in India, this impact outweighs the gains. In Europe, weaker EBITDA per tonne is expected due to lower sales volume and realisation, partially offset by reduced coking coal costs. Additionally, analysts anticipate a sequential drop in EBITDA per tonne in Europe due to lower sales volume and operating leverage.Analysts further predict a 2 percent growth in standalone volumes for the third quarter, reaching 4.9 million tonnes. They anticipate an increase of around Rs 1,200 per tonne in realisations and expect the standalone EBITDA per tonne to rise around 10 percent to Rs 14,700. However higher costs are likely to partially offset the realisation gains. Given that Tata Steel has captive iron ore, the company would not be impacted from higher ore prices leading to margin expansion sequentially, analysts said. Corus EBITDA per tonne is expected to be negative, at $177.Tata Steel's Q3 provisional sales volume in India rises 1.2 percent QoQ to 4.88 MT, driven by strong domestic demand. Steel production at 5.32 MT, up 6 percent YoY, suggests inventory buildup. In Europe, provisional sales volume drops 2 percent QoQ to 1.92 MT. The Netherlands sees a 5 percent QoQ increase to 1.29 MT but declines 8 percent YoY due to blast furnace relining. UK sales volume at 0.63 MT, down 5 percent/14 percent YoY/QoQ, reflects lower demand.""Tata Steel would again be in focus during the Q3FY24 results on how the operations are going to change for the firm at its European operations and the update on the union talks. However, at the consolidated level we see margin expansion to take place on the back of stable steel prices as well as a small impact on the coking coal front,"" said Yes Securities in its latest note.Axis Capital predicts a marginal 2 percent QoQ decline in EBITDA per tonne at Indian operations to Rs 14,705, attributed to increased coking coal consumption costs, despite higher realisations and sales volumes. In Europe, an anticipated EBITDA per tonne loss widens to $180 from $137 in Q2FY24, driven by lower sales volume and realisation, partially offset by reduced coking coal consumption costs.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions."

In response, Zee Entertainment has denied all allegations made by Culver Max and Bangla Entertainment Pvt Ltd (BEPL) regarding breaches of the MCA terms, including their claims for the termination fee.Zee is also gearing up to take legal action against Sony Pictures over the termination of the deal.Impact on Zee stock: Price targets slashed, valuation to slumpFollowing the unfavourable end-result of the merger plans for Zee, global brokerage firm CLSA has downgraded the stock to a 'sell' call from the earlier 'buy' while sharply slashing its price target for the stock by 34 percent to Rs 198.""We believe this will have a negative impact on both parties, as both companies are going through stiff competition from digital media and face a potential threat from the merger of RIL-Disney over the near term,"" said Karan Taurani, research analyst at Elara Securities.CLSA also agrees as the firm believes the scrapping of the merger will see Zee's PE will slump back to 12x levels, seen before the announcement of the deal in August 2021. ""Competition for Zee will also intensify with the reported merger of Reliance and Disney Star,"" the brokerage said in a note.Amit Kumar Gupta, founder and CEO of Fintrekk Capital also seconded concerns over a sharp correction in Zee's valuation as the media giant and its associated companies struggle with debt and holding shares pledged with lenders, for which they need cash to keep the shop running.""Zee Entertainment’s consolidated revenue from operations has also stagnated, and its operating profit margin has fallen to less than half. Net profit margin has gone from a healthy 19 percent in FY19 to just 3 percent in FY23,"" Gupta said. He also forecast Zee to have difficulties in surviving if the Reliance-Disney deal actually fructifies.Amid the pool of negative sentiments for Zee, Sham Chandak, head of institutional broking at Elios Financial Services, feels that the only saving grace for the stock could be another Indian media house showing interest in acquiring Zee. ""And that is a big 'if',"" Chandak said.No relief for Zee, even with another white knight""Despite that, even if some other corporate house was to step in to buy out Zee, expect a sharp markdown in valuation,"" he added.In response to the deal being called off, AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital believes Zee's stock will likely fall below its 52-week low of Rs 170. ""Everyone was placing their bets on the merger but with no triggers in place now, and the promoter's stake being hardly 4 percent, we think there is no skin in the game. Investors can buy out if there is a correction from here on,"" Prabhakar said.Aditya Agarwala, co-founder and director of Invest4Edu, also expects a negative impact on the stock, with a gap-down open in the stock on January 23.Also Read | Zee refutes all claims by Sony, says evaluating optionsOn the technical front, Agarwala sees a move below Rs 229 dragging the stock lower to levels of Rs 200-180. ""Further, a fall below Rs 180 will trigger a breakdown which could extend the correction to levels of Rs 160-130, while resistance sits at Rs 265-290 on the upside,"" Agarwala said.Shares of Zee have had a rollercoaster ride through 2023 as it got tangled in multiple fiascos. At the start of the year, lender IndusInd Bank approached the NCLT to initiate insolvency proceedings against Zee, a move that could have threatened the merger by stopping all transactions, including asset transfers.The proposed merger also grappled with legal challenges due to opposition from several creditors, including Axis Finance and JC Flower ARC, among others.Even though the scrapping of the deal finally closed a major chapter for Zee, the bitter aftertaste is likely to irk investors of Zee Entertainment as well as the stock.Also read | CLSA downgrades Zee to 'sell' as Sony calls off merger; expects valuation to slumpDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The Nifty 50 has formed a long bearish candlestick pattern which resembles a bearish engulfing kind of pattern formation on the weekly charts at the top of the market upcycle, indicating the possibility of weakness, though higher high formation continued for eighth consecutive week.Hence, if the index breaks the low of this month around 21,300, the crucial support, then further correction towards 21,000 mark can't be ruled out, while 21,850 will be crucial for further upside in the 'sell on rally' market, experts said.The Nifty 50 fell 1.5 percent to 21,572 for the week, with strong volumes.""Going forward, the crucial support for the index will be the weekly low at 21,285.

In a conversation with Moneycontrol, he explained that while certain defence PSU stocks have large order books, they are not generating enough cash.With 43.94 percent returns over a three-year period, First Water Capital Fund is India’s (added) second-best alternative investment fund (AIF). It is a category III, long-only AIF. The company manages Rs 700 crore with its offshore and domestic AIF vehicle.Edited excerpts from the conversation.Your thoughts on the current IPO scenario?We’re very unlikely to participate in initial public issues (IPOs). There is a lot of fashion-parading involved in IPOs, where numbers are padded up ahead of the issue to portray a better picture of the business. Miraculously, in a lot of cases, growth of the company tapers post listing for some or the other reason. We are not happy to give an exit to a private equity investor or a promoter doing an offer for sale. Specifically at this time, the IPO markets seem to have a lot of froth and we don’t see much being left on the table for investors like us, who’re not looking for just a listing pop.It is also unlikely for us to participate in qualified institutional placements (QIPs) or block deals because companies are looking for investors who keep their float passive, and we are active investors. Also, fund managers are offered a lot of incentives, like discounts on the market price, to participate in the lofty growth stories.Do you feel PSU valuations are expensive?Valuations are not expensive in and off itself. A considerable amount of re-rating has already played itself out in PSU stocks and the P/B has more than doubled in most cases. Valuations have a tendency to revert to the mean. So from here on, the easy money may be off the table and some moderation in P/B will be seen. This will lead to a more time-wise correction rather than just a price-wise correction. Some PSU stocks may end up with mediocre returns over a 2-year time frame from here on.So are you scaling down on PSUs?We are paring down some of our exposure in PSUs. They have run up more than our comfort level. While the initial re-rating was driven by excessive undervaluation, what we are seeing currently is that the rhetoric ‘Modi hai to mumkin hai’ has seen PSU names, especially central government owned-PSUs scaling to unprecedented heights. Some of the PSUs have run way ahead of fundamentals due to the defence theme such as shipbuilding stocks, which we have completely axed from our portfolio.What are certain red flags in a company?Companies which don’t have adequate cash flows, which are continuously growing but not generating cash. This is true for certain defence stocks which have larger order books but their working capital is too stretched.Another red flag is companies whose value is overly attributed to the perception of people at the helm, rather than intrinsic worth of the underlying business. In the past, we have seen that some CEOs have had a rockstar image which led to premium valuations and there was a substantial de-rating when they left; Vishwavir Ahuja of RBL Bank and Ramesh Sobti of IndusInd Bank are cases had a great influence on the extrinsic values of these companies.The business should have hard assets. We do not invest in new-age companies. If companies say that they have a user base and maybe three years down the line, they will monetize that user base, we are not interested. We will never invest into a Zomato or a Paytm for example. Likewise, we don’t invest in companies which have perennially been overvalued based on the fond hope that they will someday achieve something which they have never achieved. For example, VIP stealing the march from say a Samsonite.Any contra views?Packaging. We continue to like packaging over the years and the market hasn’t given its due to is packaging films companies like Uflex and Polyplex. And there was pain in the sector for the last two quarters because oil prices were going up and their margins contracted. Now, milder oil prices are a positive for this sector. Packaging is a proxy for the whole consumption theme. Rather than paying 60-70 times earnings for an FMCG company, we are happy to pay single-digit multiples (adjusted for cyclicality) for packaging firms.Also, Indian packaging films players have created businesses of truly global scale with manufacturing plants across the globe. Therefore the story is not just domestic but also gaining market share from the higher cost local manufacturers.Your thoughts on the pipes sector?Some pipe companies on the PVC side such as Astral and companies on the construction side such as APL Apollo have grown manifold. But 2010-2020 was a lost decade for saw pipe manufacturers like Jindal Saw, Welspun Corp and Man Industrie. They were operating at low levels of utilization and struggling with margins.  But we love situations where companies are at an inflection point. Then the embedded operating leverage will create a very high alpha for investors.What kind of  inflection point?One has invested Rs 1,000 crore to create a million tonne capacity, but because the industry is in a slowdown, the company is operating at only 4,00,000 tonnes. Then, when the industry picks up, the company does not have to invest fresh money because it already has a capacity of a million tonnes. This will translate into earnings. I am not happy to invest in a company operating at a high efficiency level and high capacity utilisation, Because if something is doing well, then where is the lever (for further growth)?What sort of companies do you prefer?Companies with a potential to invest relatively lesser amounts than a greenfield expansion interests us. Brownfield expansion happens at a fraction of greenfield. If a company sets up a new facility at Rs 1,000 crore, a brownfield will happen at Rs 500 crore because it doesn't invest in land. The company will probably add another building, block, or line.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

According to him, it is akin to the phrase 'Hindu rate of growth' that was ""unthinkingly"" used and stuck for no reason.","The government's decision to target a fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of GDP in 2024-25 may have left markets stunned, but there was no intent to ""make a statement"" of any sort with such aggressive consolidation, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran has said, adding that the interim Budget had not made any unrealistic assumptions to arrive at the lower-than-expected target.""It's not that we are trying to make a statement here. We are comfortable with the numbers,"" Nageswaran told Moneycontrol in an interview after the interim Budget.Economists polled by Moneycontrol had expected the fiscal deficit target for the next financial year to be set at 5.3 percent. However, the Indian government already has one eye on meeting its stated objective of cutting the deficit down to 4.5 percent or lower by 2025-26. Nageawaran said that commitment had to be reinforced.""We were at 5.9 percent when the Budget exercise started last year. So we need to demonstrate commitment to that path. We have to demonstrate credibility,"" he said, emphatically denying that the inclusion of Indian government bonds on global indices later this year had any role to play in setting the deficit target for 2024-25.As for what ratings agencies think, Nageswaran said while the government would welcome an upgrade, it was not ""chasing"" one.“At the end of the day, it is their prerogative. We can only do what we have to do and we are demonstrating that we are doing that. But they shouldn't be shifting the goalposts,"" the government's top economist said, echoing Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's post-Budget comments.When asked if the announcement of any major policies in the full Budget post the Lok Sabha elections could leave the fiscal deficit target untenable, Nageswaran refused to comment, saying it is ""too premature to speculate on that"".Four years of 7% growth?Being an interim Budget, Nageswaran and his team did not present an Economic Survey on January 31. Instead, on January 29, they published a report reviewing the Indian economy where they said the GDP may grow close to 7 percent in 2024-25. Nageswaran has stuck to that approximation.""I think 6.5-7 percent would be a good way to peg it...maybe tending towards the upper end of this range, at this point. But I think at least one quarter or four months of data has to pass before we can talk about the balance of risks,"" he said.For Nageswaran, giving precise growth forecasts is an exercise in futility as they always end up being wrong, except by chance.""We are here to talk about ranges of outcomes. That's why it is quite possible that we may end up achieving a fourth year of 7 percent or 7 percent-plus growth,"" he said.On January 5, the statistics ministry said the Indian economy may post a growth rate of 7.3 percent in 2023-24, up from 7.2 percent in 2022-23. In 2021-22, the GDP had increased by 9.1 percent.No K-shaped recoveryWhile India's recent growth numbers have surpassed all expectations, the general consensus among economists is that the post-pandemic recovery has been led by the upper class, with growth in demand for premium goods outstripping that for the mass-market segment. This pattern of recovery has been labelled 'K-shaped'.The government, however, has rejected this thesis, with Nageswaran adding to the criticism recently voiced by the finance minister.""This is like someone unthinkingly using the phrase 'Hindu rate of growth' that has stuck for no particular reason. It is the same Indian economy that has seen its decadal growth rates keep rising. So similarly, these kinds of alphabets are meaningless,"" the chief economic adviser said.However, Nageswaran did not deny growth has been uneven, with the coronavirus pandemic leading to reverse migration and temporarily resulting in an increase in the agricultural workforce.""We don't have data beyond 2021-22, but if you look at the RBI's KLEMS (capital, labour, energy, material, services) database, that shows that in 2021-22, manufacturing created a large number of jobs and the reverse migration began to reverse. But once you see the data for 2022-23 and 2023-24, you will see that it is beginning to happen. So obviously, until such time that you are confident of these trends, then the government would continue to make sure that it provides some sort of a buffer, or insurance to the public,"" Nageswaran said, referring to the decision to extend the free foodgrain scheme for an additional five years until 2028.Capex not slackingAs expected, the interim Budget raised the capital expenditure target for next year to a fresh record high of Rs 11.11 lakh crore, although the pace of increase cooled sharply to 11.1 percent compared to the 2023-24 budget estimate – something Nageswaran had indicated would happen way back in December 2022.""With every passing year, the base becomes higher. So you can't maintain the same growth rate on a higher base,"" he said.When asked if there were any concerns over private sector capex being concentrated in certain sectors such as construction, Nageswaran dismissed the suggestion as ""hair-splitting"".""Obviously, we would love to see much more all-round development. But certain places will start ahead of others. You are talking about a large, continental country – not everybody will be firing on all cylinders at all times."""

So college recruitment, IIM-like campuses, are important. But equally, the jobs that are getting created in the middle and lower order, are not getting counted at all,"" Sitharaman said.Moneycontrol reported on January 3 that some premier Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), which normally achieve 100 percent placements in just a couple of days, have been struggling for the last two months to find jobs for their students.However, the finance minister said the employment debate in India needed more complete data.""I think a fairer, open, and exhaustive picture of India's employment — both in the formal and non-formal areas — will have to have some kind of wider base. And we need to bring in such data so that the discussion can be more informed,"" she said.As per the latest data from the government's Periodic Labour Force Survey, the overall urban unemployment held steady at 6.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023-24, unchanged from April-June 2023. At 6.6 percent, the rate of unemployment in Indian cities is at its lowest ever since the survey was started in 2018-19.According to Sitharaman, banks' credit growth provides a good illustration of the job creation going on in the economy, especially concerning small and medium enterprises.""Why would new companies get registered in a bigger number than before if employment is not being offered? Companies cannot operate in a vacuum without human beings in them,"" she said.In its January 29 report reviewing the Indian economy, the finance ministry said that as of November 17, 2023, bank credit to micro, small, and medium enterprises had registered a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 14.2 percent from 2018-19 to 2023-24."

This was broadly in line with expectations, with a Moneycontrol poll predicting that the allocation for 2024-25 would increase to Rs 11 lakh crore.Even as Sitharaman raise the capex target for next year, the revised estimate for 2023-24 was lowered by more than Rs 50,000 crore from Rs 10 lakh crore.

We are closer to Rs 10 lakh crores,"" Sitharaman said.The 2023-24 capex target of Rs 10 lakh crore was missed primarily due to lower-than-anticipated utilisation by states of the capex loan scheme.

We have come out with a facility for updation of return. 56 lakh updated returns updated and garnered around Rs 4,600 crore taxes from that,"" Gupta said.The Interim Budget 2024-25 has announced withdrawal of outstanding small tax demands, some even dating back to 1962, of up to Rs 25,000 till 2014-15 in respect of income, wealth and gift taxes. There are about 1.11 crore such disputed demand entries and the aggregate tax demand involved is Rs 3,500-3,600 crore.Gupta said the move would benefit about 80 lakh unique taxpayers.""Small tax demand we are tackling in that (withdrawal of demands) manner and large tax demand we are tackling separately (through demand management centre). We think this exercise would yield quite a lot of dividend to us and we will be able to manage the demand in a more meaningful way,"" Gupta said.With regard to withdrawal of disputed demands which is announced in Budget, Gupta said most of these demands are on the books.There could be cases where the taxpayer has already paid the tax demand but it has not been updated on the system because it's an old demand when everything was manual. Some of the demand could be fictitious as well in that sense, because it is already been paid or not payable by taxpayer but no one has record of this, Gupta explained.""So to do away with all these and reduce grievances of taxpayers, this is a step we have taken. We believe that a number of entries of that nature what the Finance Minister has spoken about in budget speech could be a crore or more of the number of entries and number of taxpayers could be 80 lakh or so unique ones,"" he said, adding with this exercise the department can clean its books and it would be beneficial for taxpayers as well.""The amount Rs 3,500 crore (which is being withdrawn) would be insignificant compared to what we are collecting annually Rs 19.45 lakh crore. This is the right time to do exercise on that front as well and focus on collection of big demand. The manpower is limited and the effort that we will put in to recover or rectify would be much more than the benefit,"" Gupta said.The budget 2022-23 had announced a scheme for filing updated returns in ITR-U form. The form can be filed within 2 years of the end of the relevant assessment year, and taxpayers will have to give reasons for updating the income -- return previously not filed or income not reported correctly or wrong heads of income chosen or reduction of carried forward loss."

This is based on a continued path of gradual deficit reduction, as well as robust nominal growth of around 10.5 per cent of GDP.In the interim Budget 2024-25, presented in Parliament on Thursday, the government revised lower its current year fiscal deficit to 5.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent budgeted earlier.The deficit, which is the gap between the government's revenue and expenditure, will come down to 5.1 per cent in 2024-25 and further to 4.5 per cent by 2025-26.Fitch said this demonstrates a firm desire to adhere to a path of gradual fiscal consolidation even amid an election year.""The budget presented on Thursday was broadly in line with our expectations, though with a slightly faster pace of deficit reduction, from when we affirmed India's 'BBB-' rating with a Stable Outlook in January.""As such, it does not significantly change the sovereign credit profile. India's fiscal deficit and government debt ratio are high relative to peer medians, but the government's emphasis on deficit reduction helps to stabilise the debt ratio over the medium term,"" Zook said.This Budget was important in signalling the current government's clear commitment to fiscal consolidation and its capex agenda, should it return to office, he added.The government had earlier estimated that the fiscal deficit will come down to 5.4 per cent in the next financial year, beginning from April 1, 2024.However, in the interim Budget, it bettered its estimates to 5.1 per cent of GDP.""Our current forecast is for the deficit to reach 5.4 per cent of GDP in FY25, above the budget target due to more conservative revenue forecasts in the next year. But the government has shown a recent record of achieving fiscal targets, which gives credibility for it to reach the 5.1 per cent target,"" Zook said.Replying to a question in the post-budget conference on her message to rating agencies, Sitharaman said: ""Not only aligning with the fiscal consolidation roadmap that we gave earlier, but bettering it -- that is one simple, straight forward message that every rating agency should take on board."" Higher dividends from banks and financial institutions, apart from improvement in tax mobilisation, would help achieve the fiscal deficit glide path.All three global rating agencies -- Fitch, S&P and Moody's -- have the lowest investment grade rating on India, with a stable outlook. The ratings are looked at by investors as a barometer of the country's creditworthiness and impact borrowing of companies.On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service had said that the interim budget for 2024-25 firmly conveys the government's commitment to its fiscal consolidation goals, set against a backdrop of healthy economic growth.The government demonstrated fiscal restraint in not resorting to large handouts or increasing discretionary spending ahead of this year's elections, Moody's Investors Service Senior Vice President Christian de Guzman had said."

Rate cuts will likely only begin in the second half of 2024 as headline inflation stabilises nearer to the 4% target midpoint,"" said Aditi Raman, associate economist at Moody's Analytics.""While there is a risk of inflation breaching the 6% upper limit, the RBI is likely to monitor commodity and food prices closely.""Although there was no clear consensus around the timing of the first rate cut, a significant minority, 25 of 56, forecast the easing would start in the third quarter. Only 18 of those expected the first cut before July.Those expectations were despite inflation mostly predicted to remain above 4% this year and next.""The RBI finds itself in a reasonably comfortable position... the economy continues to be in a Goldilocks phase, with growth broadly steady, seemingly without resulting in demand-side inflationary pressures, yet,"" noted Rahul Bajoria, chief EM Asia economist at Barclays.The economy was forecast to grow 6.9% this fiscal year and 6.3% in FY 2024-25, a separate Reuters poll showed.In her latest annual budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India would reduce its budget gap sharply in fiscal year 2024-25 and focus on infrastructure and long-term reforms to drive growth.The government reduced its fiscal deficit target to 5.1% of GDP in 2024-25 from 5.8% this year."

He said ""The frame used to calculate average real income by the government is 10 years. The government has  looked at real incomes for all Indians and come to the conclusion based on data and said that it has increased by 50 percent.""Sinha noted that government transfers must be taken into account to calculate real income. He said ""An important thing that you have to take into account is the value of the transfers from the government. Whether it’s the Kisan Samman Nidhi, NREGA, or Gareeb Kalyan Yojna all have to be taken into account to look at real prosperity.”Message for 2024 elections:Sinha said ""The big message in the run-up to 2024 is ‘Modi Sarkar ki guarantee’.

Earlier, this scheme was implemented only in a few states, and now seeks to expand on a national level.Under the scheme, women undergo training in a range of practical skills that align with emerging industry demands. These skills include plumbing, LED bulb manufacturing, and the operation and repair of drones, among others. This diversified training approach ensures that women can tap into various sectors and explore entrepreneurial opportunities.When was the scheme launched?Addressing the country on August 15, 2023, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi announced that the government is working with Women’s Self Help Groups (SHGs) with the aim of creating 2 crore ‘Lakhpati Didis’ in villages.The PM observed that 10 crore women are today associated with Women’s Self-Help Groups. “In villages today, one can find a Didi in the Bank, in the Anganwaadi, and a Didi to provide medicines.”The PM said that 15,000 Women’s Self-Help Groups would be given loans and training for operating and repairing drones. “Drone ki Udaan” will be carried out by these Women’s Self-Help Groups, said the PM.What is the latest development?The finance minister while addressing her interim budget speech 2024-25 said that eighty-three lakh SHGs with nine crore women are transforming rural socio-economic landscape with empowerment and self-reliance.""Their success has assisted nearly one crore women to become Lakhpati Didi already.

The allocation is Rs. 750 crore higher than what was released for the program in the current financial year.The corpus announced in the Budget speech is part of the already approved outlay of Rs. 4800 crore for FY23-26, for  a comprehensive development  of  select  villages  in  46  blocks across 19 districts. These villages are near the northern border with China in the states of  Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Uttarakhand and UT of Ladakh.The objective of VVP is comprehensive development of these villages to improve the quality of life of people and attempt to reverse outmigration. The programme will create opportunities for livelihood through promotion of agriculture, horticulture, tourism and cultural heritage, skill development and entrepreneurship, among other measures.Through this program, Government aims to improve road connectivity to remote villages, housing & rural infrastructure, energy including renewable energy, television and telecom connectivity.Catch other details of Finance Minister's budget address here.One of the areas identified for development is the promotion of tourism and culture by enhancing infrastructure in these remote villages.

For the Interim Budget 2024, expectations were high that the finance minister would announce a slew of measures and capex. The total railway capex, including Extra Budgetary Resources, have gone up 1.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,65,200 crore. In the budget, the government announced that it is setting up three major railway corridors to reduce congestion and logistics costs for energy, mineral, and cement, connecting to main clusters, including enhanced port connectivity.That apart, the finance minister also announced that 40,000 normal trains will be upgraded to Vande Bharat standards. The NAMO trains and metro rail services will be  extended to more cities. This, along with the strong focus on tourism, means there is more opportunity for capacity expansion, redevelopment, and electrification of  railway lines.KEC International has strong presence in railways and higher capex for the development of corridors should benefit. We also feel that railway PSUs such as RVNL, IRCON, and RITES should continue to benefit in the light of these plans.The defence expenditure estimate for FY25 has broadly remained unchanged at around Rs 4.54 lakh crore. A ground-breaking provision in the budget allocates a substantial corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore, offering a 50-year interest-free loan for long-term financing, refinancing, and projects with negligible interest rates. This strategic financial move is poised to trigger a surge in research and development (R&D) across pivotal sectors, namely high-end manufacturing, defence, renewables, net zero, and decarbonisation. Companies at the forefront of R&D investments, such as MTAR and Data Patterns, stand to benefit significantly from this unprecedented initiative.Beyond immediate cost savings, this financial support addresses the critical need to manage the prolonged funding requirements inherent in extensive R&D projects. These projects often navigate protracted trails and approval cycles, making the extended loan term and interest-free nature of the financing instrumental in sustaining their progress. This visionary budgetary allocation not only stimulates innovation but also reinforces India's position on the global economic stage, signalling a commitment to foster advancements in technology, sustainability, and strategic sectors."

The committee now emphasises reluctance to lower rates until there's more confidence in inflation reaching 2%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell echoes this, ruling out a March rate cut. As a result, the probability of a March rate cut drops sharply from 47% to 31%, a notable decrease from less than a month ago when it was at 90%.Apart from the budget, India's fiscal deficit for Apr-Dec 2024 was at Rs 9.82 trillion, comprising 55% of the annual estimate, with government capital expenditure at 67.3% of the yearly target.

At Rs 14.13 lakh crore, the government's gross market borrowing figure for 2024-25 is sharply lower than economists' expectations of Rs 15.2 lakh crore.

As such, demand for government bonds will likely exceed their supply and should push bond yields – which are the government's cost of borrowing – lower next year despite liquidity conditions tightening sharply.On capital expenditure, Varma said the target of Rs 11.11 lakh crore – 11.1 percent higher from the 2023-24 Budget estimate and 16.9 percent higher than the revised estimate – raises the capex-to-GDP ratio to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent this year even though the pace of growth has expectedly come down.""Over the last 2-3 years, private capex was weak, so public capex stepped in. Now with private capex likely to pick up, the government is slowly stepping back to prevent crowding out,"" the economist said.On the whole, the assumptions underpinning the Budget numbers are seen as ""reasonable"", with the nominal GDP budgeted to increase by 10.5 percent next year.""There will be some hits and misses, but seems achievable overall,"" Varma said."

Apart from the multi-year growth opportunity due to large credit under-penetration in the rural and semi-urban regions, the segment also has high yields across cycles, given higher delinquencies for smaller loans.Well-established companies such as Home First Finance, Aavas Financiers and Aptus Value Housing will likely be the key beneficiaries of housing push.

In her budget speech on February 1, she noted that under the PM-Kisan Samman Yojana, direct financial assistance is provided to 11.8 crore workers. She also expressed the government's intent to raise the productivity of high-yield variety crops.According to an analysis by PRS legislative research, fund utilisation by the ministry has been above 70 percent in the last decade. Allocation to the ministry increased by 141 percent in 2019-20 on account of PM Kisan.Nearly 48 percent of the allocation to the ministry in 2023-24 was towards PM Kisan. The scheme became operational on December 1, 2018. It provides income support of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal instalments to all land-holding farmer families. According to the guidelines, state governments and UT administrations identify the farmer families. In 2021-22, Rs 66,825 crore was spent on PM-Kisan and according to the revised estimates, Rs 60,000 crore is estimated to have been spent on the scheme, lower than the budget estimates, in year at Rs 68,000 crore.Challenges for the year aheadIndian farm sector clocked a growth rate of 4.4 percent in the past six years (2017-18 to 2022-23) but the first advance estimates for  FY 24 indicate a seven-year low growth of 1.8 percent, aggravated by poor monsoon (El-Nino effect) in 2023. Analysts predict that production of major Kharif crops could witness a decline in 2024, allied activities such as livestock, fishing and aquaculture are also likely to decline. Rabi sowing has been muted as on December 1, while sowing of key Rabi crops such as wheat, pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals had declined to 434.66 lakh hectares, around 67 percent of the normal area.Promise of doubling farmer incomesPrime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to double farmer incomes by 2022 and a committee was formed to suggest a blueprint. The committee recommended that the cost of production be reduced, ensuring remunerative prices for agricultural produce. A slew of schemes have since been designed to buffer farmer incomes. The schemes include PM Kisan and PM Fasal Bima Yojana. As of available data, the average monthly income of agricultural households was Rs 2,115 in 2002-03 and in 2018-2019, it reached Rs 10,218. This is according to the MOSPI Committee on Doubling Farmers Income 2017.The government has taken steps to improve remunerative prices for farmers, including procuring certain crops at minimum support prices. The MSP for wheat in 2023-24 was fixed at Rs 2,125 per quintal, more than double the cost of production, while for paddy, the MSP for 2022-23 was fixed at Rs 2,040 per quintal with the cost of cultivation pegged at Rs 1,360. The ministry had adopted the recommendation of the committee and the MSP for all Kharif and Rabi crops was increased."

Here, Moneycontrol tells you which numbers matter the most and what they mean for the economy in 2024-25","The Union Budget for 2024-25, presented on February 1, was a vote-on-account with the Lok Sabha elections due in April-May. The full budget will be presented by the next government in July.But that does not mean the set of numbers that have been presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman can be ignored. The Interim Budget, like a full one, contains thousands of numbers, one as important as the next. Here, Moneycontrol tells you which numbers matter the most and what they mean for the economy in 2024-25.Size and deficitThe total size of the 2024-25 Budget stands at Rs 47.66 lakh crore — 6.1 percent bigger than the revised estimate for 2023-24. To help meet the gap between its income and expenditure of Rs 16.85 lakh crore, or the fiscal deficit, pegged at lower-than-expected 5.1 percent of the GDP, the Centre will borrow Rs 14.13 lakh crore from the market by issuing bonds.On a net basis, after adjusting for the payments it will make for bonds maturing the next financial year, the Centre's borrowing programme has been estimated at Rs 11.75 lakh crore.Key Numbers of 2024-25 Budget (in Rs lakh crore)FY25 BEFY24 RE% changeTotal Receipts47.6644.906.1%    Gross Tax Revenue38.3134.3711.5%    Non-tax Revenue4.003.766.4%Total Expenditure 47.6644.906.1%    Capital Expenditure11.119.5016.9%Fiscal Deficit16.8517.35-2.8%Gross Market Borrowing 14.1315.43-8.4%When it comes to spending the money, the government earns and borrows, capital expenditure remains the dominant force.At Rs 11.11 lakh crore, the Centre's capex target for 2024-25 is at a fresh record high and 16.9 percent higher than the revised estimate for this year. As expected, the Centre has missed its Rs 10-lakh-crore target for 2023-24 by around Rs 50,000 crore.On the receipts front, the finance ministry continues to remain realistic. The Budget estimates that the Centre's gross tax collections will rise to Rs 38.31 lakh crore in 2024-25, up 11.5 percent from the revised estimate for this year. Net tax revenues — arrived at after adjusting for transfers to states —are seen rising 11.9 percent to Rs 26.02 lakh crore.Within taxes, corporate and income tax collections are seen rising 13 percent and 13.1 percent. Excise duty collections are pegged 5 percent above this year's revised estimate at Rs 3.19 lakh crore, while the Centre's Goods and Services Tax collections are seen rising 13.1 percent to Rs 9.18 lakh crore.Revenue Break-up (in Rs lakh crore)FY25 BEFY24 RE% changeGross Tax Revenue38.3134.3711.5%  Net Tax Revenue26.0223.2411.9%    Corporation Tax10.439.2313.0%    Personal Income Tax11.5610.2213.1%    Customs2.312.195.8%    Excise3.193.045.0%    Central GST9.188.1213.1%Non-tax Revenue4.003.766.4%    Disinvestment0.500.3066.7%    RBI, PSU bank Dividend1.021.04-2.3%Non-tax revenue for the next financial year has been pegged at Rs 4 lakh crore, up 6.4 percent.

While the former has been pegged at Rs 50,000 crore, the central and public sector banks are expected to give a dividend of Rs 1.02 crore next year.On the whole, Sitharaman has been far more aggressive in consolidating the Centre's finances than was expected. But the real test will come first in the Lok Sabha elections and then the full Budget in July where - as the finance minister confidently said in her speech: ""Our government will present a detailed roadmap for our pursuit of 'Viksit Bharat'."""

This will boost infrastructure growth and have a multiplier effect on other industries.“The multipronged economic management over the past ten years has complemented people-centric inclusive development…All forms of infrastructure, physical, digital or social, are being built in record time,” Sitharaman said in her shortest budget speech.Presenting her sixth budget, the minister said the government has put in place a system for the effective and timely delivery of programmes and large projects.“Our vision for ‘Viksit Bharat’ is that of “Prosperous Bharat in harmony with nature, with modern infrastructure, and providing opportunities for all citizens and all regions to reach their potential,” the FM said.Industry players had expected higher allocation, especially in an environment where the private sector continues to be jittery about scaling up investments.""Infrastructure allocation increase of 11.1 percent is, frankly, below expectation after the 30 percent and 35 percent increases of the last two years. Hopefully, as this is only an interim carry-on Budget, when the full Budget for 24-25 is formulated, the government may consider going back to the 30 percent hike levels,” said Vinayak Chatterjee, Infravision Foundation Founder and Managing Trustee.Experts are not too worried about the lower allocation, given that it is interim budget.

The huge upward revision in the budget estimate comes after the RBI transferred an unexpectedly large dividend of Rs 87,416 crore in May 2023.While the central bank's interventions in the foreign exchange market helped boost its coffers, the dividend it finally transferred could have been as high as Rs 1.2 lakh crore if not for the decision by the RBI's board to raise the central bank's Contingency Risk Buffer to 6.0 percent from 5.5 percent.The Contingency Risk Buffer comprises the RBI's provisions to cover any potential risks — be it credit, operational, financial, or related to monetary stability — and can be described as the country's savings for a rainy day.The RBI will likely transfer the dividend to the Centre in May 2024 after its accounts for 2023-24 are finalised. As such, the dividend for 2024-25 will be from the RBI's operations for 2023-24.Also Read: Would've transferred full surplus to govt had I been RBI Governor, says Subhash GargIn the course of performing its duties, the RBI generates revenue.

This is well below the 10.5 percent the finance ministry had assumed in the 2023-24 Union Budget. Normalisation of the base effect and the key Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation remaining subdued due to cooling global commodity prices have been responsible for nominal growth undershooting the government's expectations this year.However, with wholesale inflation – which has a strong bearing on nominal GDP growth – expected to keep rising in the coming months after remaining sub-zero for the first seven months of 2023-24, India's growth without adjusting for inflation is seen higher next year.Higher nominal GDP growth is essential to improve the Centre's finances considering its committed expenditure – interest payments, salaries, and pensions – are difficult to reduce, while capital expenditure remains a key focus area.In her Budget speech, the finance minister surprised one and all by targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of GDP for next year, well below expectations of 5.3 percent."

And, even after the improvements that we have seen recently, the fact is it remains a very weak fiscal performance compared to the metrics that we are assessing it against,"" Kim Eng Tan, S&P managing director for APAC sovereign ratings, said on December 14.S&P's assessment is shared by other global rating agencies, with Moody's Investors Service also requiring a fiscal deficit ""much narrower"" than 4.5 percent of GDP for it to reconsider its view on India's fiscal strength.Also Read: India's sovereign rating utterly absurd, says PM-EAC's Sanjeev SanyalAll the three global ratings agencies — S&P, Moody's, and Fitch Ratings —  have assigned the lowest investment-grade rating for India.However, it is likely that the government's aggressive compression of its deficit will be given a thumbs-up, with bond markets already surging.""The first impression from the budget speech and fiscal deficit numbers for 2023-24 and 2024-25 suggests that the government is serious about achieving the fiscal consolidation path of 4.5 percent fiscal deficit by 2025-26,"" Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings and Research, said.Like other countries, India's fiscal deficit ballooned due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Hence, investors should not pay much heed to the budget day market movements.Source: Moneycontrol ResearchIndia is now a multi-year growth opportunity and the reforms process is a steady exercise and not a one-off issue. Hence, investors usually get over the budget’s impact in a few trading sessions.However, what matters for the markets in the medium to long term is the earnings trajectory. To that extent, any budgetary announcement that can lead to meaningful earnings revision will merit attention. Also, the valuation of the markets has a bearing on the post-budget movement.Source: Moneycontrol ResearchOur analysis suggests that whenever the one-year forward Price Earnings of the Nifty is above 21x,  markets have delivered a one-month negative return post the budget.Seen in this context, the current valuation at 19.1x one-year is not only reasonable but at a discount to the ten-year average of 19.5x. Hence, going by historical trends, we do not foresee a negative one-month return.We believe India’s current strengths — the transition to sustainable energy, the trillion-dollar manufacturing exports opportunity, its unique advantage to become a global service hub, the great infrastructure build-up along with the evergreen consumption opportunity — are mega trends for investors to ride on for many more years.The earnings growth story in India is trending higher in a structural manner, supported by favourable demographics, improved labour productivity, and a multipolar world that will drive up services exports and FDI. The formalisation of the economy is getting reflected in the earnings growth of Corporate India. We have reasons to believe that beyond the earnings growth, there are several structural changes, including reduced reliance on volatile foreign flows, the coming of age of Indian retail investors, and a rising share of stable domestic liquidity, which will keep inflows into equities elevated for many more years.Hence, any weakness in this market will be short-lived and bought into for the long term.For more research articles, visit our Moneycontrol Research page"

Meanwhile, net tax collections may be nearly Rs 60,000 crore higher than previously thought.""2023-24 tax revenue continued to imitate the non-linear relationship between economic activity and taxes, significantly outdoing nominal GDP growth,"" noted economists Madhavi Arora and Harshal Patel of Emkay Global Financial Services. According to them, increasing formalisation, better compliance, improving growth momentum, healthy corporate profitability, and ""stealth benefits of GST-led formalisation"" have driven the rise in direct tax collections this year.Tax collections this year have indeed been impressive, with the available numbers, so far, suggesting a tax buoyancy of 1.7 – far higher than the average of 1.2 across the five pre-pandemic years from 2014-15 to 2018-19.No Econ Survey, but Fin Min report says FY25 GDP growth may be close to 7%Tax buoyancy is the ratio of growth in tax collections to nominal GDP. As such, the buoyancy is said to be greater than 1 when tax collections grow faster than nominal GDP. However, economists see the tax buoyancy declining in 2024-25. According to India Ratings and Research, the net tax revenue buoyancy, or the ratio of growth in net tax revenue to nominal GDP, maybe 1.2 in 2024-25, down from their forecast of 1.9 for 2023-24.Last year's Budget numbers had suggested a net tax revenue buoyancy of 1.1.To be sure, the budgeted and actual tax buoyancy can differ substantially, as the above chart shows. The government's actions on compliance have in particular meant that tax collections have been better than expected. And the same could happen next year.""The GST audits by the government are also helping to unearth cases of under-reporting, inappropriate input tax credit, and fake invoices. This may also provide some further legroom for GST collections as compliance continues to improve,"" Elara Capital said in a note."

However, it surpasses the estimate of 8.9 percent provided by the statistics ministry for the same period. GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicatedNominal GDP growth, representing the country's GDP without adjusting for inflation, plays a crucial role in determining various aspects of a Budget. It serves as the basis for calculating metrics such as the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio.

Therefore, the economic growth has a strong bearing on tax collection and, in turn, on fiscal consolidation,"" India Ratings and Research noted.However, economists expect wholesale inflation, which has a strong bearing on nominal GDP growth, to keep rising going ahead. As such, nominal GDP growth is seen higher in 2024-25 than in 2023-24.As per the statistics ministry's first advance estimate of national income for 2023-24, India's nominal GDP is seen growing by 8.9 percent this year to Rs 296.58 lakh crore. The 2023-24 Budget had assumed the nominal GDP would grow to Rs 301.75 lakh crore.The Indian government is looking to cut its fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26. India must lower fiscal deficit 'a lot more' to get higher rating, says S&PAfter two years of very high nominal growth thanks to high inflation and a favourable base post the pandemic-stricken year of 2020-21, the Centre's annual fiscal deficit has come down sharply to an expected 5.9 percent of GDP this year from 9.2 percent in 2020-21. But with the base effect's normalisation outweighing the increase in wholesale inflation, nominal GDP growth has also plummeted from 16.1 percent in 2022-23 and 18.4 percent in 2021-22. This may complicate the consolidation of the Centre's finances.Follow Moneycontrol's comprehensive LIVE coverage of Budget 2024According to ANZ economists Dhiraj Nim and Sanjay Mathur, the Centre may look to lower its fiscal deficit next year by a ""less than the optimal"" 50 basis points to 5.4 percent of GDP from 5.9 percent this year.""A sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit ratio (70 basis points or more) is rare and requires much higher nominal GDP growth,"" Nim and Mathur added."

However, this is unlikely to be met, with economists of the opinion that it may be revised slightly lower to Rs 9.7 lakh crore.

And there are already signs that capex growth has started to cool.""On a six-month rolling sum basis, capex growth has moderated from 50.7 percent to less than 9 percent,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said in a note.For April-November 2023, the Union government's capex stood at Rs 5.86 lakh crore – or 58.5 percent of the allocation – meaning that it has fallen behind the run-rate needed to meet the full-year target.As usual, the capex allocation for 2024-25 will likely be dominated by defence, railways, and roads and highways. Further, the amount of long-term, interest-free loans to states under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment may be raised slightly from Rs 1.3 lakh crore this year.However, states are unable to fully utilise this scheme.""We expect states to fall short by Rs 20,000-30,000 crore in availing this facility.

With India’s inclusion in bond indices, the transparency of its macro numbers will be under greater scrutiny than ever before.","The Vote on Account speech might be shorter and grand announcements might be fewer but the numbers presented in the interim budget remain sacrosanct. This may only be a trailer for the big finale that will follow when the new government is formed, but the macro data presented in the budget will continue to form the crux of the budget.So, here are the big numbers to watch out for:GDP A review put out by the government on the Indian economy has pegged India’s growth rate at or above 7 percent for FY 24. In a world that’s struggling to grow at 2 percent, 7 percent growth is an encouraging number. There are projections for the Indian economy to clock real growth of 7 percent in FY 25 as well. S&P Global has forecast India’s GDP growth rate in 2023-24 to be 6.9% while the RBI’s projection is 7 percent. Why is this number important? Because a higher growth rate means higher economic activity, translating into higher incomes, spending power, jobs and so on.Fiscal deficitThe big number that the markets will be watching for is the fiscal deficit. How much will the government spend and how much will it have to borrow? Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said that the government intends to reduce its fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent by FY 26. The FRBM Act has fixed a target containing Central Government debt to 40 percent of GDP by 2024-25. A fiscal deficit higher than 5.2 percent could imply that the government might not be able to meet the target of 4.5% by FY 26.Capital expenditureThe government has been steadfast in its focus on capital expenditure. Overall public sector capital investment has gone up from Rs 5.6 lakh crore in FY 15 to Rs 18.6 lakh crore in FY 24. The government has been riding high on its capex push. If the finance minister announces a low capex growth number, anything below a 15% increase could disappoint the markets.Market borrowingsThe government has a borrowing plan to meet its spending targets. It borrows money through government securities and treasury bills. When the government decides to stick to its borrowing programme, it largely keeps bond yields in check. If the government resorts to higher borrowings than projected, interest costs also go up, putting pressure on the fiscal deficit and government finances. The government borrows funds twice a year. The first part of the borrowing is shared as part of the budget announcement. The second part starts around late September or October. The Reserve Bank of India and the department of expenditure finalise how much the government will borrow. The expectation is that it could borrow around Rs15.2 lakh crore in gross terms in 2024-25, down from the Rs 15.43 lakh crore budgeted for the current financial year.Consumption and manufacturing spendsIn a pre-election budget there could be announcements that specifically target a consumption boost, a feelgood factor. Also, the government could continue with its manufacturing push through the PLI scheme. The date for incentives under the scheme could be extended and the scheme could be expanded to other sectors. Farmer welfare scheme PM Kisan could also see its allocation go up to give rural demand a boost.Election expenditureKeep an eye out for election expenditure, which will see a massive jump from Rs 340 crore for the current fiscal year. This number will be lurking under the law and justice header.Stay tuned with our live updates: Budget 2024 LIVE Updates: Nirmala Sitharaman's Union Budget speech to start at 11AM"

It did not provide final figures for Central GST, State GST, or the cess that has been collected.""During the April 2023-January 2024 period, cumulative gross GST collection witnessed 11.6 percent year-on-year growth (till 5PM of January 31, 2024), reaching Rs 16.69 lakh crore, as against Rs 14.96 lakh crore collected in the same period of the previous year,"" the finance ministry added."

The commerce ministry, on January 31, revised this figure slightly up to 7.9 percent. The output of the eight core sectors had grown by 8.3 percent in December 2022.In April-December, the output of India's eight core industries was 8.1 percent higher year-on-year, the same as in the first nine months of 2022-23.The weaker core sector growth in December was largely due to an unfavourable base, with with the overall index of the eight core industries having surged by 10.1 percent month-on-month in December 2022 - the period on whose basis the year-on-year growth in output in the last month of 2023 is calculated. As such, all but two of the sectors saw poorer growth performance in December compared to the growth numbers they had posted in November.The performance of the eight sectors in December is as follows:>> coal output up 10.6 percent as against 10.9 percent in November>> crude oil output down 1.0 percent as against a fall of 0.4 percent in November>> natural gas output up 6.6 percent as against 7.6 percent in November>> refinery products output up 2.6 percent as against 12.4 percent in November>> fertiliser output up 5.8 percent as against 3.4 percent in November>> steel output up 5.9 percent as against 9.4 percent in November>> cement output up 1.3 percent as against a fall of 4.0 percent in November>> electricity output up 0.6 percent as against 5.7 percent in November""The positive aspect was the improvement in cement output with growth of 1.3 percent following the contraction seen in the previous month,"" pointed out Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge Ratings.The slower increase in core sector output in December means industrial growth, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), may also cool down as the eight core industries make up more than 40 percent of the weight of the IIP.Data on the IIP growth for December will be released on February 12.In November, IIP growth had already slumped to an eight-month low of 2.4 percent from October's 16-month high of 11.6 percent as fewer working days on account of Diwali took a tool on production. With the unfavourable base effect continuing in December too, economists see industrial growth to be muted around 2 percent."

However, a lower nominal GDP than what the Union Budget had pencilled in could result in the fiscal deficit printing at 6.0 percent of GDP,"" said Aditi Nayar, ICRA's Chief Economist.The fiscal deficit in December, at Rs 75,694 crore, is more than five times what it was in December 2022. However, for April-December 2023 as a whole, the fiscal deficit was down 1 percent year-on-year.The surge in the fiscal deficit in December was spurred by a huge increase in capital expenditure, which more than doubled year-on-year to Rs 87,985 crore, taking the total for year to Rs 6.74 lakh crore. The pick-up in capex is encouraging after it had slowed down in recent months, leading to economists predicting that the Centre may miss its record target of Rs 10 lakh crore for 2023-24.According to a Moneycontrol poll of 15 economists, the government may revise down its capex for the current financial year by around Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 9.7 lakh crore.The sharp increase in capex in December was responsible for pushing up the government's total expenditure last month by seven percent to Rs 4.02 lakh crore. For April-December, the Centre's spending amounts to Rs 30.54 lakh crore, or 67.8 percent of the full-year target, and is up 8.4 percent compared to the first nine months of 2022-23.On the income side, total receipts were down 9.5 percent year-on-year in December at Rs 3.26 lakh crore, with net tax revenue 11.1 percent lower even as gross tax revenue rose nearly 13 percent on the back of a 15 percent rise in corporate tax collections and 24 percent jump in the income tax mop-up. The Centre's receipts fell in December even though gross tax collections were up due to the central government releasing an additional instalment of tax devolution to states during the month.For April-December, the government's total receipts were up 13.5 percent at Rs 20.72 lakh crore. While tax collections have been robust, non-tax revenue crossed the Budget estimate of Rs 3.02 lakh crore in December, standing at Rs 3.12 lakh crore so far this year, largely thanks to the huge surplus transferred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in May."

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. In a surprising turn of events, Saudi Arabia has directed its state-controlled oil giant, Aramco, to halt its plans to increase crude production capacity from 12 million barrels per day to 13 million barrels per day. This directive, issued by the Saudi Ministry of Energy, aims to maintain the current Maximum Sustainable Capacity (MSC).Following government instructions, Aramco, a publicly-listed company, had previously announced its intention to elevate production capacity to 13 million barrels per day by 2027.Analysts interpret this move as a cautionary signal regarding future demand. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) December annual report projected a global oil demand increase of 2.3 million barrels per day in 2023, reaching 101.7 million barrels per day. Oil prices experienced an upswing on Tuesday after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth forecast.Saudi Arabia's decision is unexpected, particularly given assertions by various agencies that fossil fuel growth is in its concluding phase. Amidst the prevailing decarbonisation trend and global agreements to reduce carbon footprints, the move by Saudi Arabia seems counterintuitive.This decision is also surprising against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East impacting oil supplies, and the developments in the Americas where the United States is once again issuing threats of sanctions against oil-rich Venezuela.As the dominant force in the OPEC oil cartel, Saudi Arabia stands out as one of the few nations globally capable of increasing output, possessing a spare capacity of three million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia's decision suggests a strategic delay since other nations are maximising their oil production. It may be anticipating a reduction in production from other nations or engaging in a pricing strategy, expecting oil prices to rise as they constrain output.Irrespective of the motive, Saudi Arabia's actions are inflationary, likely to keep energy prices elevated. Unless alternative energy sources significantly impact fossil fuel consumption, Saudi Arabia appears poised to capitalise on every unit of oil it produces.Investing insights from our research teamMarico: Core categories remain subduedCraftsman Automation: Wider use of aluminium in vehicles augurs well; reasonable valuationLarsen & Toubro: Growth momentum could moderateMahindra Finance: Healthy Q3FY24 performance, with asset quality in focusPetronet LNG: Worst is over for this gas stock, earnings growth returnsCholamandalam Investment: Q3 margin stable on better asset mixWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Wealth God, Honey make right (s) choice in Indiabulls Housing, unseasonal Rain, SME I-bankers in SEBI's crosshairs, MFs' tried and tested formulaUnion Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman’s excellent fiscal recordMature Indian investors know that Budget 2024 is but one of many stock market triggersBudget Snapshot: Government to step up focus on agriculture sector, execution keyWhy the Evergrande crisis is not a big dealMahindra Finance gets growth right, but costs bitePolitical strategy must steer rooftop solar power to the massesClimate bugs in developmental economicsLEX | The days of $100 oil prices are over (republished from the FT)Budget 2024 must focus on these six areas of transport infrastructureBudget 2024 has to provide an AI roadmap for Viksit BharatMusk loses $55 billion, but there’s a lot more at stake for TeslaForeign auto makers exiting China are making a smart moveThe world is transitioning to American oil from Saudi crudeTechnical Picks: Kalyan Jewellers, DLF, IPCA Lab, Bank of Baroda and Lead(These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Pro"
63,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/how-the-finance-commission-can-be-strengthened-12161881.html,How the Finance Commission can be strengthened,"January 31, 2024 02:41 PM IST","Much of the work and legacies of previous Finance Commissions is getting lost because it isn’t a permanent body. Administrative difficulties also abound. A provisional solution is to turn the Finance Commission Division (FCD), as the custodian of FC records and responsible for its award implementation, to be turned into full-fledged department, serving as the permanent secretariat for the Finance Commissions","Article 280 of the Indian Constitution stipulates that a Finance Commission (FC) has to be constituted every five years to set the parameters for distribution of taxes between the Union and the states along with the distribution principles amongst the states themselves. While Prof Arvind Panagariya already stands notified as 16th FC Chairman, other members and office bearers’ appointment may also take place soon. By October 2025, the Commission would have submitted its report and shut shop in all probability. That brings a fundamental poser – should there be a permanent FC? If not, is there an alternative option?Finance Commissions – Over The YearsMost economists and public policy practitioners favour the status quo. Part of the reason is that Article 280 has worked reasonably well. Beginning with the First FC in 1951, all FCs were commissioned in time. The FCs were dynamic, independent and progressive in resource distributive methodology. The Union Government’s flexible approach in terms of reference (ToR) also helped. Over the period, established economists and public finance professionals chaired successive FCs. KC Pant (10th FC) was the last politico to head an FC. This lent more credibility and respect to the FC recommendations.However, in the last two decades, the states bargained for increased share in the distributable taxes and resources. The 11th Finance Commission had recommended 29.5 percent for states in the proceeds of Union taxes. The 12th FC raised this to 30.5 percent; 13th FC to 32 percent; and the 14th FC raised this to a whopping 42 percent. The 15th FC had retained the same, if the share of the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh were to be factored in.The result has been a definite shift towards States without accounting for their responsibility and weakening of North Block. One example would suffice. On the fifth floor of a building in New Delhi’s CGO complex, there lies a sleepy office called the Finance Commission Division (FCD). The division, functioning under the administrative control of the Department of Expenditure in the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for timely release of funds based on the FC awards. Until the 13th FC award, this office was a major hub of activities and State Resident Commissioners were frequent visitors to this place. However, since then, the number of central schemes and centrally-sponsored schemes came down drastically. Concurrently, the number of staff and the visibility of the office also reduced.Three Arguments For A Permanent FCAdditionally, multiple practical considerations related to the FC, right from its notification to the award implementation – warrant a debate on the permanency of FC. First, an early challenge for any FC is to search for a centrally located place closer to the North Block and other ministries. Rented accommodations are no match to the aura of North Block. Residential accommodation and other logistical arrangements are equally challenging. The 12th FC had recommended that adequate arrangements for office and residence of the chairman and members of the FC must be made before the notification of the commission, so that the FC’s time is not wasted in routine administrative matters.Second, institutional memory and perpetuation of thought process matters! That way, subsequent FC might be losing out on the institutional wisdom, knowledge and experience of predecessor FCs. The records and files are sent to the FCD where they become part and parcel of the archival collection and serve no public purpose thereafter. These records are excellent primary sources and could lead to original PhDs and research papers on fiscal federalism and financing of disaster management.Third, there are post implementation problems as well. For instance, the 15th FC had recommended a non-lapsable modernisation fund for defence and internal security (MFDIS) and had even made the allotments to the Ministry of Defence and Home Affairs. Unfortunately, not enough progress could take place. Many grants are tied; such as holding of elections in the local bodies and fulfilment of other conditions. These are only representative problems; there are many others that could have been better managed by a permanent FC.Unfortunately, the entire debate on a permanent FC is under-developed. Perhaps, a middle way compromise would be to strengthen the Finance Commission Division in the Department of Expenditure itself. As the custodian of FC records and responsible for its award implementation, the FCD is best suited to carry forward the institutional legacy of outgoing FC in the interregnum. The 12th FC had indeed recommended that this division should be constituted into a full-fledged department, serving as the permanent secretariat for the Finance Commissions. While that is not possible, an expanded FCD with a larger mandate is the best way to perpetuate the spirit of FCs.Bhartendu Kumar Singh is in the Indian Defence Accounts Service and had served as Director, FCD, between 2018-21.

According to the report, global gold ETFs saw a third consecutive annual outflow, losing 244.4 tonnes compared to 109.5 tonnes in 2022.","Global gold demand declined 5 per cent to 4,448.4 tonnes in 2023, compared to the previous year, mainly due to continuing Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) outflows, according to the World Gold Council (WGC) report.The overall global gold demand was 4,699 tonnes in 2022, according to WGC's Gold Demand Trends report 2023.   According to the report, global gold ETFs saw a third consecutive annual outflow, losing 244.4 tonnes compared to 109.5 tonnes in 2022.Losses were most marked in Europe, where holdings fell by 180 tonnes - the worst annual performance since 2013.  The pace of outflows slowed markedly into year-end, but October's hefty outflows dominated the fourth quarter (October-December), it added.Outflows from European funds have continued in the opening weeks of 2024, and North American-listed funds have resumed their decline after a two-month respite in November and December, the report said.Strong equity performance and continually shifting expectations surrounding the timing of rate cuts buy major central banks across the world could be the likely drivers for the outflows, it added.Meanwhile,  central bank buying was down 45 tonnes in 2023, at 1,037 tonnes compared to the previous year's 1,082. The central bank buying in 2023 was the second highest year on record, said the report.In 2023, the People's Bank of China with 225 tonnes and the National Bank of Poland with 130 tonnes added the most to their reserves, while the Central Bank of Uzbekistan and the National Bank of Kazakhstan were the biggest sellers, the WGC report stated.The report noted that the Central banks have been consistent net buyers on an annual basis since 2010, accumulating over 7,800 tonnes in that time, of which more than a quarter were bought in the last two years.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) added 16.2 tonnes of gold to its reserves in 2023 and 32 tonnes in 2022, the WGC data stated.    Turning to bar and coin investment, demand was subdued and down 3 per cent as strength in some markets worked to offset weakness elsewhere.European demand continued to plummet, down 59 per cent year-on-year, the report said, adding that this decline was offset by a strong post-Covid recovery in China, where annual demand was up 28 per cent to 280 tonnes, combined with increases in India (185 tonnes), Turkey (160 tonnes), and the US (113 tonnes).The global jewellery market proved to be remarkably resilient amidst record-high prices as demand inched up 3 tonnes year-on-year, with China playing an important role, recording a 17 per cent increase in demand for gold as it recovered from Covid-19 lockdowns, offsetting a 9 per cent decrease in India, said the WGC report.""Unwavering demand from central banks has been supportive of gold demand again this year and helped offset weakness in other areas of the market, keeping 2023 demand well above the ten-year moving average. In addition to monetary policy, geopolitical uncertainty is often a key driver of gold demand, and in 2024, we expect this to have a pronounced impact on the market,"" WGC Senior Markets Analyst Louise Street commented.Ongoing conflicts, trade tensions, and over 60 elections taking place around the world are likely to encourage investors to turn to gold for its proven track record as a safe haven asset, she said.""We know that central banks often cite gold's performance in times of crisis as a reason to buy, which suggests demand from this sector will stay high this year and may help to offset a slowdown in consumer demand due to elevated gold prices and slowing economic growth,"" she added."

With a US court voiding a $55 billion compensation package, the Tesla board must now come up with a new package to supposedly keep Musk from taking his best ideas elsewhere","For Elon Musk, the Delaware Court of Chancery is like a giant anti-ATM, sucking wealth away from him. Late on Tuesday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick voided a $55 billion compensation package that Tesla Inc awarded the chief executive in 2018. In 2022, the same judge presided over the case in which Twitter Inc eventually forced Musk to go through with his acquisition of the company, with him backing down before it went to trial. Twitter, now X, has not thus far been a star performer.Musk took to the platform after the ruling to warn any unsuspecting entrepreneurs out there: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.”His tweeting habit suggests this latest setback didn’t come as a complete surprise. Only a couple of weeks ago, he issued a thinly veiled threat to take his best artificial intelligence-related ideas elsewhere unless he was granted another giant slug of Tesla stock, claiming activists might steal in and take control. It was nonsensical on at least two levels — the value of his own Tesla stake rests on those AI dreams and his involvement as CEO and chief marketer (see this). But it suggested some nervousness about the pending ruling.That ruling, which will likely be appealed, effectively takes away Tesla stock options valued at about $51 billion, which he has yet to exercise. He retains a 12.9 percent direct stake in the company, worth $79 billion at the current share price, some 58 percent of which was pledged as collateral for personal loans as of last March. He also has other large holdings, such as in Space Exploration Technologies Corp, or Space X. He can still afford the jet, although losing the top spot in the global wealth rankings might rankle a bit.More importantly, the travesty and paradox that is governance at Tesla is, once again, on full display.The judge’s ruling that the board was conflicted in awarding Musk the giant compensation package will hardly surprise any longstanding Tesla watchers. The company’s board, whose longest serving member is Musk’s own brother, has long been something more like an ongoing satire of a board. It has presided over numerous Musk outrages and dubious corporate moves, not least the acquisition of SolarCity Corp — which owed Musk money — and the supposed take-private deal that will forever be associated with the less-than-watertight phrase “funding secured.”Presumably, the board — still with some members dating from 2018 — must now come up with a new package to supposedly keep Musk from taking his best ideas elsewhere. It’s all so — what’s the word — Tesla-ish.Musk’s own desire for more stock comes in the wake of having sold a chunk of his Tesla holding while buying a social media platform that takes away yet more time from his main day job as an electric-vehicle tycoon and, as a bonus, may alienate the folks who tend to buy those EVs. That dumping of almost $40 billion worth of his Tesla stake, from late 2021 through 2022, coincided with a slump in the shares (see this), and this latest ruling will surely raise concerns about how his personal finances might impact the stock from here.All of this comes at a moment of weakness on the corporate front. Tesla has just abandoned its growth target for the core autos business while it works on developing a new mass-market electric vehicle, having instead, on Musk’s orders, decided to launch the Cybertruck, which is more of just a mass.Musk’s centrality to Tesla’s mystique means such absurdities can, and likely will, be accommodated. He is both the chief asset and chief risk; it being hard to imagine Tesla valued anywhere near $600 billion without him. That reality may represent the board’s bigger failure.Liam Denning is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg "

This will adversely impact auto majors who have invested billions of dollars in India and force them to wind up,"" it said.It added that there is no reason to offer these concessions to the UK either, as the UK mostly assembles cars with parts imported from the EU (European Union), and China.It said if India offers duty concessions to the UK, it might face pressure to do the same for other free trade agreement partners like Japan and Korea.""This could lead some companies to reduce or even stop making cars in India and instead export them from their home countries. This will be rewarding imports over competing local production and lead to closure of many key units,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.India is negotiating a trade agreement with the UK, which is at an advanced stage of talks. The UK is seeking duty concessions on EVs.He suggested that the government should support the industry through continuing the present tariff regime and additional PLI (production linked incentive) support.It also recommended investing in R&D on the next generation of battery technology instead of subsidising EVs on road.""The import intensity of EVs exceeds 70-90 per cent and most imports including batteries are from China. With over 70 per cent of power being generated from coal, EVs will not be green enough in India,"" it said.Citing an example, it said that Australia, in 1987, produced 89 per cent of the cars it used. It protected the car industry through a high 45 per cent import duty. But the share of locally produced vehicles came down as Australia reduced import duties gradually.""Today, Australia imports nearly all cars as tariffs came further down to a 5 per cent level. Most manufacturers in Australia shut shop,"" the report said.""In contrast, India could attract significant investments in the car sector on account of high import duties. This resulted in the development of an indigenous car and auto component industry,"" it added.Talking about the major challenges being faced by the auto sector, the report said that the industry is facing global supply chain issues that are driving up the costs of materials such as steel, aluminum, and rubber, coupled with a significant shortage of semiconductor chips.Additionally, disruptions in Red Sea shipping routes and various geopolitical conflicts are delaying delivery, increasing costs.""The sector is under pressure from increasingly strict regulatory compliances. These include stringent emission standards, and heightened safety regulations,"" Srivastava said.He added that the industry relies significantly on imported components, especially for advanced technologies and specialized features.This dependency makes the industry vulnerable to fluctuations in global supply chains and foreign exchange rates.""In FY2022, the estimated value of imported automotive components and other inputs was USD 20 billion, with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and auto part suppliers contributing 60 per cent and 40 per cent respectively,"" the report said.Around 70 per cent of these imports are in four categories - engines, drivetrains, electrical systems, and electronics.As the value and importance of electronics in new cars increase, the reliance on imports is also expected to grow, it said adding China is the biggest source of imported auto components for India, accounting for nearly 25 per cent of total imports.Japan, Germany, South Korea, and Thailand are other major import sources.It also said that about 70 per cent of India's passenger cars are made by companies controlled by foreign firms.India is the world's fourth largest car producer, after China, Japan, and the USA, making 4.6 million cars in 2023. In exports, India ranked at tenth position, with a share of 2.4 per cent.It contributes 7.1 per cent to the country's GDP, up from 2.8 per cent in 1992-93. It also accounts for over 50 per cent of India's manufacturing GDP.

The budget presented on February 1 last year pegged it at Rs 15.43 lakh crore for 2023-24.However, the finance ministry is hoping to lower the Centre's annual gross borrowing through bonds to Rs 12-13 lakh crore over the next few years, Moneycontrol had reported earlier.In 2019-20, the last 'normal' year prior to the pandemic, the Centre's gross market borrowing was Rs 7.1 lakh crore. While it is unlikely to fall to such low levels, discussions are on to lower the annual gross market borrowing over the next three to four years.The central government funds its fiscal deficit through a mix of borrowings from the bond market, proceeds from small savings schemes, and the drawdown of its cash balance.

Rystad Energy puts the cost of additions at around $60 billion.","The world is on the cusp of what’s likely to be the last big refining boom as India embarks on a capacity expansion to accommodate the country’s rising thirst for fossil fuels.The South Asian nation has set in motion a building blitz at its oil refineries to raise production of traditional transport fuels such as gasoline and diesel, which could lift capacity by more than 20% over the next five years. Rystad Energy puts the cost of additions at around $60 billion.It’s a rare boost for a global refining industry that’s in a state of decline in the US and Europe, while China’s massive sector is adjusting to Beijing’s green goals after years of development made it a processing powerhouse. By contrast, India’s growing transport demand and the slower adoption of electric vehicles will keep appetite for gasoline and diesel higher for longer.“Expansions in the West are non-existent,” said Giovanni Serio, Vitol Group’s head of research. “Expansions continue to be based in the areas where demand is growing. India is the one where we see the continuation of a trend of growth of over 200,000 barrels a day between now and the next four or five years.”India’s refining capacity is projected to increase by 56 million tons by 2028, Junior Oil Minister Rameswar Teli said last month, without elaborating. That equates to an overall capacity boost of 22%, or 1.12 million barrels a day.The government has not provided details of how it will reach those lofty levels. By Bloomberg calculations, state-run refiners have announced about 50 million tons of expansions that could fit Teli’s timeline. Projects that account for almost 37 million tons have commissioning dates from 2024 to 2026, but completion of the remaining capacity remains unclear and includes planned additions that are under execution and a consideration stage.The biggest is at Indian Oil Corp.’s Panipat plant in Haryana state, which is adding 10 million tons and is due to be commissioned at the end of next year. Hindustan Petroleum Corp.’s new Barmer refinery in the northwestern state of Rajasthan is the next largest at 9 million tons. Development is expected to be completed in 2024, with the facility to run at full capacity by 2025.Smaller expansions are being conducted at the Visakhapatnam and Gujarat refineries, and the Barauni plant at Begusarai city in Bihar state.Still, Vitol’s Serio says 56 million tons is not an absurd number. “Having said that, I think from our standpoint, when we look at the probability of these projects, we see roughly half of that more likely right now.”State-run refiners will likely have to shoulder most of the responsibility. Reliance Industries Ltd. — the biggest private oil processor and owner of the giant Jamnagar complex — is seeking to replace gasoline and diesel with clean fuels to take advantage of a transition toward greener energy.“India has been a laggard in adding new refinery capacity in the past, which requires some catch up if it wants to be more self-sufficient,” said Sushant Gupta, an oil analyst at Wood Mackenzie. The consultant sees the nation’s demand growing 1.3 million barrels a day by 2030.The Asian nation is not only meeting its own demand requirements, it’s also playing an important role shipping fuels to other regions such as Europe after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted supply, most notably for diesel.Capacity BoostThe International Energy Agency estimates that India will add 1 million barrels a day of capacity over the six years to 2028, taking processing to 6.2 million barrels a day — a 19% increase to total refining. China is adding more daily volume but the overall capacity boost is 8%. The Middle East is around 9%.While the percentage gain is big, India’s refining industry is still dwarfed by most other countries including the US and Europe, which are trimming capacity. China’s sector is over three times larger.India’s planned additions include petrochemical complexes, but most of the capacity will be for transport fuels. The nation’s overall refining capacity was almost 254 million tons as of April 1, 2023, according to government data.“Given that India is still a developing economy, it makes sense for the country to still focus heavily on traditional fuels investments while at the same time, putting in some groundwork for green energy transition,” said Dylan Sim, an oil analyst at FGE.India also has plans to boost liquefied natural gas capacity and still heavily relies on coal for power generation, but the country is seeking to be part of the energy transition and has set itself a net-zero goal by 2070."

But, they could also indicate that they are ""not in as much of a hurry as the market expects to cut rates.""The Fed could also suggest that they don't want rates to be too restrictive as they aim to generate a soft economic landing, Chandler noted.Many analysts expect the Fed's first rate cut will be aimed at preventing too wide a gap between inflation and the fed funds rate, as this would tighten financial conditions more than the Fed intends.Treasury yields fell and the dollar weakened after Powell in December indicated that the Fed was pivoting to an easing cycle.The dollar index was last up 0.04% at 103.52.

Relative to gross advances, the GNPAs of SCBs rose almost five-fold from 2.2 percent in FY11 to 11.2 percent in FY18.Growth in bank credit moderated between FY15 and FY18, burdened by the piling-up of GNPAs."

The full Budget for the financial year 2024-25 is expected to be presented by the new government in July after the Lok Sabha elections.Among various key figures, market participants are eagerly awaiting the nominal GDP growth estimate for 2024-25.The nominal GDP growth assumption is crucial to Budget calculations. For instance, the absolute fiscal deficit as a percentage of nominal GDP for next year is a key metric. A higher nominal GDP growth number – and, consequently, a higher nominal GDP – can make the fiscal deficit smaller as a percentage.As per the statistics ministry's first advance estimate of national income for 2023-24, India's nominal GDP is seen growing by 8.9 percent this year to Rs 296.58 lakh crore. The ministry had assumed in its calculations in the Union Budget presented on February 1, 2023 that the nominal GDP would grow 10.5 percent this year to Rs 301.75 lakh crore.Economists' expectations of next year's nominal growth are in a fairly wide range of 9.5 percent to 11.5 percent.""Fiscal consolidation in India has mostly been revenue-driven due to expenditure rigidities. Therefore, the economic growth has a strong bearing on tax collection and, in turn, on fiscal consolidation,"" India Ratings and Research noted.However, brokerages seem a little more optimistic and their estimates lie anywhere between 10 percent and 11.5 percent.Two years of very high nominal growth – thanks to high inflation and a favourable base – in 2021-22 and 2022-23 helped the Centre rapidly bring down its fiscal deficit to an expected 5.9 percent of GDP this year from 9.2 percent in 2020-21. But with the base effect normalising, nominal growth has come off sharply from 16.1 percent in 2022-23 and 18.4 percent in 2021-22."

There was a lot of resilience in many, many parts of the world in the last year and going into 2024,"" he said, highlighting countries including China, Russia, Brazil and India.Despite the upgrade, global growth is predicted to remain below its recent historical average of 3.8 percent this year and next due to continued impacts of elevated interest rates, the withdrawal of pandemic-related government support, and persistently low levels of productivity.Among the Group of Seven (G7) advanced economies, growth in European countries looks set to remain weak, reflecting ongoing challenges, while Japan and Canada are expected to fare slightly better.The IMF's overall inflation outlook remained unchanged at 5.8 percent for 2024, but that masks a significant underlying shift between richer and poorer countries.Inflation in advanced economies is now forecast to be 2.6 percent in 2024, down 0.4 percentage points from October, while emerging and developing economies are expected to hit an annual inflation rate of 8.1 percent, up 0.3 percentage points.Much of the increase can be attributed to ongoing trouble in Argentina, where consumer price increases exceeded 200 percent last year amid an ongoing economic crisis.US, China lift growthThe United States and China, the world's two largest economies, both saw significant upgrades to their growth outlook for 2024, putting them on track for a less substantial slowdown than the IMF previously anticipated.The IMF now expects the US economy to grow by 2.1 percent in 2024 -- an election year in which President Joe Biden is seeking a second term -- down slightly from an estimated 2.5 percent in 2023.This is largely due to the ""statistical carryover effects from the stronger-than-expected growth outcome for 2023,"" the IMF said.China's economy is meanwhile on track to hit 4.6 percent growth this year, down from 5.2 percent last year.The better-than-expected growth figures are down to property sector ""difficulties"" having a less severe impact than the IMF had anticipated, and also because of the ""significant fiscal support coming from the authorities,"" Gourinchas said.An ongoing bright spot in the global economy continues to be India, which the IMF now expects to grow by 6.5 percent this year -- up 0.2 percentage points from October -- following an estimated growth rate of 6.7 percent in 2023.The Fund also increased the growth prospects for Russia, Iran and Brazil for the year ahead.Challenges remain in EuropeWhile many Asian economies remain buoyant, Europe continues to cast a long shadow over the global outlook, with the IMF highlighting ""notably subdued growth in the euro area.""Germany is once again set to be the slowest-growing G7 economy, expanding by just 0.5 percent this year after contracting by an estimated 0.3 percent in 2023.The United Kingdom, France and Italy are all also expected to see growth of 1.0 percent or less this year, while Spain's economy is forecast to fare slightly better, growing by 1.5 percent.The tepid euro area growth reflects ""weak consumer sentiment, the lingering effects of high energy prices, and weakness in interest-rate-sensitive manufacturing and business investment,"" the IMF noted in the WEO report.Despite some challenging forecasts, the overall picture in 2024 looks set to be less gloomy for many countries than it was in 2024: Every country cited in the WEO report save Argentina is set to have positive growth this year.This is an improvement from 2023, when four out of the 30 economies cited in the report are estimated to have contracted, according to the IMF."

The housing sector is in its third year of a slump. The stock market is testing new lows. Youth unemployment remains worryingly high, even as the government tweaks the statistics.There is a bright spot, however. Young people are busy traveling, taking advantage of the free time — there are few good jobs out there — as well as the consumer power that comes with a deflationary economy.As China enters  the month-long Lunar New Year travel season, expectations are high that young millennials and Gen Z, inspired by hit TV shows such as Divas on the Road, will be touring around. After all, we witnessed a busy Jan. 1 long weekend. Domestic tourists totaled 135 million, up 9 percent from the pre-pandemic 2019 level. Those aged below 34 were the driving force.They went to the most unexpected places. The northeast city of Harbin, which has been hosting the annual Ice and Snow Festival for decades, became a top destination. It was a boom for an icy, freezing place that has long suffered from population decline and fiscal struggles.Social media has played a big role. Entertained by the “southern potatoes,” a nickname given to tourists wrapped in layers of winter clothes, locals offered visitors free rides across the city. The government installedsmall, warm houses as well as an artificial moon above a local Russian Orthodox Church, to provide better lighting, and cater to a generation obsessed with taking Instagram-worthy selfies. All these welcoming gestures were recorded and amplified on popular platforms.Shandong province’s Zibo, a small, declining industrial town in eastern China, offers another case study for places that went viral. Young Chinese flocked to the city of 4.7 million, where $10 can buy roughly 35 meat skewers. They were pleasantly surprised by “how sincere and honest” local businesses were, as they didn’t raise prices even when tourism demand surged.Open-minded and budget-conscious youths are drawn to hidden gems. They prefer hanging out with the locals and learning ethnic minorities’ way of life to shopping in glitzy resorts such as on the island of Hainan. And when they have saved enough money for overseas trips, they are following in the footsteps of those Divas on the Road, who ventured to Saudi Arabia in the latest season. During the eight-day October holiday, Chinese descended on Dubai, en route to places like Egypt and Jordan.These are healthy developments. When economic prospects dim, it’s a good time to slow down and reflect. During the 1974 recession, Steve Jobs travelled to India in search of spiritual teachings. So who knows? Those digital nomads hanging out in “Dalifornia,” a nickname for Dali insouthwest China, known for its eastern Himalayan scenery and work-life balance, may just be able to find their soulmates and business partners, too. A few might even come up with ideas that can reshape the world.For years, the hospitality industry in popular destinations only saw dollar signs when tourists arrived. Commercialism came before anything else. But young millennials and Gen Z are creating seismic changes in consumer tastes and economic fortunes. Last year, duty-free sales in subtropical Hainan were 12 percent below the 2021 peak. The gaming hub of Macau fared even worse, and no longer has the power to charge exorbitant hotel  rates.Travel expands one’s world view, but trips that evolve around shopping sprees do not. Young Chinese are discovering genuine hospitality and alternative ways of life on a budget. We all cherish our backpacking days — they will, too.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

While the company does not share its volume growth numbers, it is estimated to be in the low single-digits based on the value sales growth of 3.6 percent. Now, the Street was expecting some slowdown in volume growth but a decline was certainly not pencilled in. Its results have made analysts a bit more circumspect about how the cigarettes business can fare in the near term, and its shares are down by 1.8 percent at 11.30am, extending a recent decline visible in its shares.There is the question of what this means for ITC and we have analysed its results in today‘s edition. The question assumes importance as cigarettes may contribute to around half of revenues but it contributes to four-fifths of segment profits. It’s not only crucial for profitability but also for cash flows, and is what the company relies on to pay out fat dividends to shareholders and incubate new businesses. To know what its results mean for the stock and what investors should do, please read our research team’s take here. There’s a short term view and then a long term view, with the latter mattering more for investors.A big puzzle is why volumes slipped. ITC did say that it saw some consolidation in the base. That is corporate-speak for saying that demand had peaked. That could have been accepted as the main reason if volumes had slowed down but a decline points to a cutback in consumption. In cigarettes, one does not expect to see that happen, as smokers are typically partial to their brands and also habituated to a certain number a day.Now, there have been times in the past when volume growth has stumbled into a decline. A trying time for cigarette companies was when taxes were hiked in successive years and prices rose to a level that hurt consumption. If that was the intent of the government –the anti-tobacco movement prescribes taxes as a way of lowering consumption—then it worked. Then there was the pandemic-induced lockdowns that saw a large part of the market –officegoers and students—sheltering at home, cut off from their usual routine. Lack of mobility hurt cigarette consumption too and even after lockdowns were lifted, work from office resumed in a gradual fashion only.Basically, these two events were enough to unseat people from their smoking habits, breaking inelasticity of demand, which in the case of cigarettes means that even when prices move up consumption does not get affected. There have been other threats too, such as banning of smoking in public places or sale on railway stations, but none as painful as these two events. Eventually, once tax hikes became a thing of the past the situation normalised. And, once work from office resumed full-fledged the demand for cigarettes turned healthier. But, maybe, that demand has also peaked. Do read another take on ITC’s results to see what could explain the slip in consumption.One of the main drivers of a return in normal cigarette consumption is a stable tax regime. While the interim budget is not expected to introduce any indirect tax measures, the main event to watch out is the main budget normally held in July post-elections. If all else remains the same, then the main aspect investors will need to watch out for is if the illegal cigarette trade is kept under check, leaving room for the legal trade to grow. A bigger question is if the market for cigarettes will continue to grow, particularly in the income segments crucial for companies –buyers in the premium categories. For instance, in the US, current smoking has declined from 20.5 percent of all adults in 2005 to 11.5 percent in 2021. The Global Youth Tobacco Survey found that in India, current cigarette smokers in the 13-15 years age group fell from 4.4 percent of those surveyed in 2009 to 2.6 percent in 2019 (but those who were ever cigarette users was higher at 4.6 percent).Just as we catch up to the developed world in several aspects, there is a possibility that in cigarette smoking too we may do the same, and that poses a risk for cigarette companies in the long run. But the near term may also be seeing the effect of stress on disposable income in certain income groups, leading to a moderation in consumption of even essential or addictive items such as cigarettes or a downgrading by users to cheaper brands or alternatives. A similar theme may be playing out in cigarettes too. Just as households manage their budgets, smokers too may be adapting their consumption to suit their pocket.Investing insights from our research teamGAIL: Strong show in the quarter, the story keeps getting betterBajaj Finance: Higher provisions mar Q3FY24 earningsIs AU Small Finance Bank a good buy, post the steep fall?Concor puts up a sturdy show in Q3Sky Gold: Shining performance to continueTrackerPro Economic Tracker | Vehicle registration tepid; power usage gains for seventh straight weekWhat else are we reading?Budget 2024: Do budgets impact market trends?Union Budget 2024: The finance ministry’s view of the economy on the eve of the BudgetMC Pro Quick Take | Bajaj Finance is resilient but growing borrower leverage needs a lookThe best tool to spot a bull market -- for freeA Made in India policy needed to create global SMEsOberoi Realty: Stable cash flows key to sustaining growth plansGlobal trade: the looming tensions over China’s subsidies (republished from the FT)Why Budget 2024 must focus on manufacturing, emerging sectors, and R&DBudget 2024’s primary renewables challenge is to find the funds for speedier energy transitionThe party making INDIA bloc's Maharashtra seat sharing extremely trickyChina, India banks under pressure from different liquidity storiesBiden should handle Iran forcefully — But with restraintAmerica is subsidising Iran’s fight against AmericaMonkey Man: Dev Patel's new film owes debt to Amitabh Bachchan, not Keanu ReevesPersonal FinanceDo you have to pay tax on gifts received?Technical Picks: Larsen and Toubro, Voltas, Escorts, PFC and Silver mini(These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app). Ravi AnanthanarayananMoneycontrol Pro"

In December alone Pakistan exported around 700,000 tons of rice,"" the dealer said.Basmati rice exports could jump 60% this year to 950,000 tons, while non-basmati exports could surge 36% to 4.25 million tons, he said.In terms of value, Pakistan's rice exports could fetch more than $3 billion this year, an increase from the previous year's $2.1 billion, said Aadil Nakhoda, assistant Professor at Karachi-based Institute of Business Administration.Traditionally, India offered non-basmati rice at a lower price than Pakistan.However, with India out of the market, buyers are switching to Pakistan, and local prices are gradually rising despite higher production, said Hammad Attique, director, sales & marketing at Lahore-based Latif Rice Mills.Pakistan is offering 5% broken white rice at around $640 per ton and parboiled rice around $680 per ton, up from $465 and $486 respectively a year ago.Pakistan currently exports non-basmati rice mainly to Indonesia, Senegal, Mali, Ivory Coast, and Kenya and premium basmati rice to the European Union, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, dealers said.In India's absence, Vietnam, Thailand, and Pakistan are trying to fill the gap. However, Pakistan's relative proximity to buying countries in the Middle East, Europe and Africa is providing it with a freight advantage, said a Mumbai-based dealer.""India is likely to review export curbs after the elections in May. Pakistani exporters have already shipped around two-thirds of the entire year's shipments, and they are expected to sell the entire quantity before May-end,"" the dealer said.Pakistani farmers have been getting record prices for their paddy, which is likely to encourage them to expand planting area in the next season, said Kewlani.""Even in the next season Pakistan will have a bigger surplus for exports if weather supports,"" he said."

This was the highest monthly outflow since January 2023.In January, the Sensex was down 0.4 percent, while Nifty gained 0.05 percent. Other Asian countries also experienced losses: Hang Seng fell by 5.8 percent, Shanghai declined 4.3 percent, Kospi lost 9 percent, and Jakarta 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the Topix index rose 2 percent, while Nikkei advanced by 2.6 percent.Apart from India, Sri Lanka saw outflows of $6 million, this month. However, other Asian countries saw inflows. Japan led with the highest equity inflows of $12.28 billion, followed by South Korea and Taiwan with $2.23 and $1.72 billion, respectively.Thailand got around $803.4 million, Indonesia received around $407 million in inflows, Malaysia $92 million, Philippines $85.2 million, and Vietnam $45 million. China’s foreign fund flow data is not updated. According to a recent Kotak report, China saw inflows of $10.8 billion in December 2023.According to Rajesh Palviya, Analyst, Axis Securities, the Indian outflow has been because of subdued corporate earnings visa-vis valuations, which has made investors cautious.Analysts noted that FII selling in India was particularly triggered by HDFC Bank's results. Additionally, the rise in US treasury yields prompted FIIs to book profits in the Indian markets. Analysts further said that across the globe, markets have been volatile due to the situation in the Middle East, and its impact on global growth and inflation.Globally, attention is on the next meeting of the US FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) on January 30-31, 2024. With the expectation that there will be no rate cut, the focus is on the commentary as the macroeconomic data shows improvement, said Neeraj Gaurh, Fund Manager, Axis Securities, PMS .Analysts are optimistic about the Indian economy, and foresee financial stability and sustainable growth. The outlook includes expectations of manageable inflation and a stable cost of borrowing. Despite limited fiscal space, the government is urged to maintain a delicate balance between fiscal deficit and growth through government capex. While new market highs bring excitement, analysts caution against potential geopolitical risks. They emphasise that earnings growth, rather than valuation re-rating, will be the key driver for the markets.According to Deepak Jasani, Analysts, HDFC Securities, Indian equities may continue to see volatile times in the first half of 2024 due to the elections and a global change in central banks’ views on interest rates. Sell-offs can result in bargain buying by existing and new players as the view on India remains positive, while profits can be booked when stock prices rise, he added.SEBI's additional disclosuresRecent news reports suggested that FIIs in India are selling to adhere to SEBI's enhanced disclosure norms aimed at preventing manipulation of minimum public shareholding (MPS) rules, and avoiding indirect control of Indian companies by overseas entities through shell firms. However, some news reports also suggested that the granular details of beneficial ownership required from FIIs may be lower than initially asked for in SEBI's consultation paper.In 2023, SEBI mandated additional disclosures for FIIs holding over 50 percent of their Indian equity AUM (assets under management) in a single corporate group, or with over Rs 25,000 crore in AUM in Indian markets, with the goal of protecting investors against potential circumvention of MPS rules.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

While global demand has remained weak, Acharya expects it to improve in the fourth quarter of FY24.Talking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Acharya shares his outlook on demand and prices and explains why the company has trimmed its FY24 capex to Rs 18,000 crore from Rs 20,000 crore planned earlier. Edited excerpts of the conversation:Net profit in Q3 FY24 has grown five-fold year-on-year, but it has dipped on a sequential basis. Tell us about these numbers.  We had a very strong production performance in Q3. At 6.87 million tonnes, this was the highest production at JSW Steel, including at our Ohio operations. It grew by about 8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and 12 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. Our sales at six million tonnes on a consolidated basis were slightly lower — 5 percent lower quarter-on-quarter — but still 7 percent higher on YoY basis. The primary reason for the drop in sales was lower exports because the global markets were weaker. So the export volumes were lower. That saw a drop of about 20 percent. And imports into India impacted retail sentiment and resulted in some general destocking. The retail sales were lower. However, our sales to institutional OEM (original equipment manufacturers) and industrial customers were at their highest in this quarter. Automotive sales, renewable sales, and our tin packaging sales were at their highest ever. So we saw a growth of almost 8 percent quarter-on-quarter in our OEM industrial and institutional sales overall. Our core focus is that, and that continues to remain strong. Automotive, as I said, was the highest in this quarter. We see that going forward into the next quarter, it will be a seasonally strong quarter. Internationally, steel prices have started moving up on the back of elevated raw material prices. And we will see some part of that reflected in the Indian market in the coming months.Steelmakers like JSW Steel and Tata Steel are riding on the strong growth in the domestic market. What’s your outlook on demand in India going forward, and will it get impacted given that this is an election year?In Q3, imports rose by 16 percent, while exports fell by a similar 16 percent. We had a net import of 1.2 million tonnes, which ate into the domestic incremental demand quarter-on-quarter. But having said that, I think we now see better traction in the January-March quarter with respect to volumes, both from an international perspective as well as from a domestic perspective. There may be a blip during the election quarter, which may come in the next few months. But directionally, we do not see any change in the capex spend or the focus on manufacturing that the government has undertaken. We expect the momentum of India’s economic growth, as well as the steel consumption growth, to remain strong in the medium term as we go into this decade.After your Q2 results, you had warned about steel being diverted to India because the demand was strong here. Given this backdrop and the fact that the Ministry of Steel has said that they are not looking at increasing the import duty on steel, are steelmakers concerned?Despite a weak global environment, India is doing quite well. And it's today the bright spot among major economies in the world; our steel consumption reflects that. And we have seen very strong growth for nine months of this year. Our consumption is at about 100 million tonnes with a growth of close to 15 percent. Some part of our demand was lost to imports. Typically, trade gets diverted into India because of a weak global market, and we need to be wary about that. The Indian steel industry is investing in capex to meet the demand of the country in the years to come. The government will probably need to look at the imports and take some measures to restrict unfair trade. As long as the trade is fair and the pricing is fair, it's fine. But if it's unfair trade at predatory prices, we should be wary and take steps to control it.Is this one of the reasons why you have reduced your capital expenditure plan for the financial year from Rs 20,000 crore to 18,000 crore?There is no change in our focus on capex. Steel demand in India last year was 120 million tonnes. This year, we expect the steel demand to be in the range of 134-135 million tonnes, which means 14–15 million tonnes incremental growth. If we look at even an 8-10 percent consumption growth year-on-year, every year we'll be incrementally adding this 12-15 million tonnes of demand in India. So, the capacity in India should be able to meet the domestic demand, and we are quite focused on that. And our capacity expansion is on track at Vijayanagar and Bhushan Power & Steel Limited (BPSL). We will be completing our expansions of 6.5 million tonnes this year and another 1.5 million tonnes next year to reach about 37 million tonnes by FY25. The capex would get passed on to the next financial year; it is just a timing issue.Is there greater pressure to control costs for businesses like yours given the weak global demand? How are you managing costs, and is there a plan to secure raw materials to keep a check on costs? In this last quarter, we saw a cost increase because of higher coking coal and iron ore prices. But we were able to balance that out with a better blend in terms of coking coal in our mix.We have been awarded three new mines at the auction in Karnataka, which will also go on stream in FY25. We are also ramping up our Orissa mines. On the iron ore side, we'll look at options that make strategic sense in terms of being closer to our locations and continue to bid for them. On the coking coal side, while we are improving our blends and looking at using leaner mixes in our coking coal coke ovens, we continue to scout for assets internationally and domestically to improve our overall coking coal securitisation. And these two remain our focus areas as we go into the next few years.You were also looking at a stake in Canada's Teck Resources but it was acquired by Glencore. What went wrong, and what is the learning?No, nothing really went wrong. We were a strong contender for Teck. However, I think Glencore has taken a call to look at 77 percent of the asset, and Teck and Glencore have agreed to proceed on that basis. However, we remain engaged in our focus on acquiring coking coal mining assets in international and domestic markets, as I said. We are looking at Australia, Canada, and Mozambique for newer assets as well, and we are in talks with some. Our focus is on domestic coking coal. As I said last time, we have two mining assets, which we are trying to commission as soon as possible. We will continue to look at more domestic coking coal assets to improve our blend and our raw material security in coking coal.We are discussing a few assets, but nothing concrete as of now. We will come back to you when we have something clearer.There's a buzz in the market that you are not really looking at sourcing coking coal from Russia on concerns that that may probably make exports to Europe a little bit of a challenge. What is your stance on it?We have a basket that is quite diverse in terms of our coking coal or metallurgical coal procurement from across the world. We have Australia, Canada, and various other locations from which we procure coking coal, including some from Mozambique. We procured some from Russia as well for certain specific goals, which we have been doing for many years. That continues. We do not see any challenges with the mix that we are having in the blend. What we are doing continues, but we are not trying to enhance further coking coal sourcing from Russia as of now. Russian imports account for a small percentage.JSW Group has announced that it is acquiring MG Motors. There may be some synergies with JSW Steel. Is there any plan to leverage that? Our foray into the automotive space with a focus on electric vehicles (EVs) is being done by group companies, and that's a different business. JSW Steel will not be directly involved in that. As we progress into the joint venture and look at completing it closer to time, we will look at what synergies are there between MG Motors and JSW Steel. It could be specifically with respect to supplies of steel for their production of vehicles.We are almost at the end of the financial year. Should we expect any M&A-related announcements from JSW Steel, in particular for the rest of the financial year? No, we don't see that happening. Nothing is on the cards."

While economic trade-offs stay challenging amid reducing fiscal impulse to growth, the policy prerogatives and spirit will not be derailed.Although the risk of competitive populism has abated at the central level, we do expect few relief measures for the rural/farm/welfare sector.Interim budget a non-event, yet an important policy signalling toolThe upcoming budget, being interim in nature, would likely to be a non-event as far as big-bag announcements, new tax or spending pitches are concerned. However, it will still set the stage for policy choices ahead and will be watched out for pace of fiscal consolidation and policy priorities on capex and non-capex spend.We expect the policy direction and prerogatives to remain largely similar to recent budgets, as the trade-offs remain between nurturing the growth recovery and diminishing fiscal space with challenging debt dynamics. Besides, improving intersection of politics and economics implies that political capital is no longer as compromised around the election cycles as perceived.Click Here To Read All Budget Related NewsSteady consolidation ahead: FY25 GFD/GDP poised to tighten to 5.4 percent versus 5.9 percent in FY24Amid various push and pull, FY24 GFD/GDP could just about balance at 5.9 percent as budgeted. The positives buffers such as (1) robust tax collection, (2) super-normal RBI dividend, (3) mild capex cuts (4) expenditure jig etc, would offset (1) higher payouts than budgeted on food, fertiliser subsidy, (2) miss on ambitious divestment targets, (3) lower nominal GDP growth. GFD is gross fiscal deficit.For FY25, we model steady consolidation of 0.5-0.6 percent and see GFD/GDP at 5.4 percent. The scope of too populist looks to be bleak amid moderating tax revenue growth and high committed revenue expenditure (revex) and heavy market borrowings and of course the nature of interim budget.The asset sale print will likely remain below Rs 50,000 crore, while the RBI dividend would be viewed closely. We assume a 10.5 percent nominal GDP growth. A more aggressive nominal GDP assumption in budget could make government balances look optically better.FY25E Capex/GDP to rise further to 3.3 percent; Revex focus on rural, welfare spendingThe Centre’s Capex/GDP ratio will likely rise to 3.3 percent - almost 1.6-ppint  higher than pre-pandemic ratio, even as capex growth may normalize to sub 15 percent. The capex focus will be continue to be specifically on roads, railways, housing, and rural/urban infrastructure. Even as Centre may further extend capex incentives to states, the capacity for states to spend may be nearing its limits.Capex/Revex mix will further improve. Revex/GDP will also ease to 11.2 percent vs 12.0 percent in FY24 and focus will likely be on welfare, rural, and MSMEs. The major subsidy burden may hug Rs 4 lakh crore, with extension of the free food scheme to be offset by mild declines in fertilisers and oil subsidy outlays.Tax buoyancy to lose vigor but tax base stays strong; non-tax revenue stream to easeWe expect gross tax/GDP ratio to stay steady at 11.4 percent after a robust tax buoyancy in FY24 across segments. India's fiscal profile has become structurally healthy, amid better tax compliance, and resilience in domestic growth. We do not expect any major announcements for tax mobilisation and rationalisation, however some tinkering around the new concessional tax regime may not be fully ruled out.Separately, non-tax revenue would still be healthy led by RBI dividend amid consistent FX sales, but may fall short of last year’s bumper surplus. Regarding conventional divestment, the windfall gains may face pressure from stake sales of government's large holdings, which are mainly concentrated in commodity companies and utilities sector.Net market borrowings elevated at Rs 11.5 lakh crore; Gross borrowing may range Rs 15.2 lakh croreWe expect FY25 net borrowing to be around Rs 11.5 lakh crore (Rs 11.8 lakh crore in FY24) - 65 percent of total fiscal funding versus 67.4 percent in FY24E. Heavy reliance on NSSF (more than 25 percent of GFD) will continue, as deposit rates have barely moved meaningfully in last one year.Gross borrowing would be Rs 15.2 lakh crore, assuming (1) no switch or rollover takes place for G-sec papers redeeming in FY25, (2) no direct re-investment proceeds by the RBI in FY25 of its maturing G-sec bonds.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The report ""India's Transition to E-cooking"" by the independent think tank Centre for Science and Environment also said that the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana led to a rapid expansion in access to liquified petroleum gas (LPG) in India, but it has ""not guaranteed a sustained transition to clean cooking in households"" that benefited from the scheme.Around a third of the world's population 2.4 billion people globally (including 500 million people in India) still lack access to clean cooking solutions. This causes untold damage to the economy, public health and the environment. Approximately three million people globally (including 0.6 million people in India) die prematurely every year because of indoor air pollution. These deaths are mostly caused by wood-based cooking, the report said, citing research conducted in the past.Although the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG) claims that the country's household LPG ""coverage"" stands at 99.8 per cent, the National Family Health Survey conducted in 201921 (NFHS-5) shows that 41 per cent of the population still cooks on biomass, it said.

Through PMUY launched in May 2016, more than 100 million households in India received LPG cylinders by the end of March 2023.However, over 50 per cent of the households that received new LPG cylinders under PMUY did not choose to refill it even once, the CSE said. ""This was due to high costs of refill, cultural or behavioural beliefs, and a lack of significant LPG cylinder distribution networks where the beneficiaries lived,"" the report said.As of March 2023, the average cost for a refill of an LPG cylinder (14.2 kg) was approximately Rs 1,100 across India. The average Indian household requires eight such cylinders solely for cooking in a year. That translates to approximately Rs 8,800 spent on cooking fuel alone per year. As per the NITI Aayog's Tenth Five-Year Plan, the average annual income of a Below Poverty Line (BPL) family is capped at Rs 27,000, which means an average BPL family (who are the primary beneficiaries of the PMUY scheme) have to spend one-third of their annual income on cooking fuel alone, the CSE said."

Consumer staples companies such as Hindustan Unilever are seeing muted volume growth, weighed down by sluggish recovery in the rural markets. Read our Budget Snapshot: A long wait for consumption revival.Meanwhile, real estate companies, which primarily sell apartments to urban residents, are seeing a strong rebound in sales. Residential sales in the top eight cities increased to 10-year highs in 2023, shows Knight Frank data analysed by Motilal Oswal Financial Services.DLF, a large seller of residential dwellings in the National Capital Region (NCR), registered record sales volumes in Q3 FY24. “A strong NCR market, combined with an aggressive launch schedule, gives DLF management confidence about growing FY25 pre-sales by 15 percent from a high base and drives upgrades to our sales and earnings estimates,” add analysts at Jefferies India.Sales volumes of other real estate developers have also grown at a healthy pace in the December quarter. Anecdotal evidence suggests a good offtake in premium automobiles indicating steady spending at high income households.The COVID disruption and the rapid rise in inflation in recent years have adversely impacted incomes and spending of the low-income households. Inflation and rapid rise in prices reduced disposable incomes. Harsh weather conditions and drop in crop yields posed additional headwinds for farmer incomes in rural areas. In contrast, high-income households withstood the COVID disruption better, thanks to steady jobs and better earnings growth.Ahead of the 2024 general election, the government will try to give a fillip to rural incomes. However, the government will have to strike a fine balance between spending and fiscal prudence as it cannot risk stoking inflation.

Accordingly, in 2024-25, real GDP growth will likely be closer to 7 percent,"" the report added.The report is a departure from the normal as it comes just two days before the Budget session of Parliament begins. While the government does not present an Economic Survey prior to an interim Budget, which is only a vote-on-account ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, Moneycontrol had exclusively reported in November 2023 that the finance ministry would publish a 'concise' document detailing the state of the Indian economy ahead of the interim Budget's presentation on February 1.In its report, the finance ministry said: ""This is not the Economic Survey of India prepared by the Department of Economic Affairs.

The Indian central bank has since raised its growth forecast to 7 percent.Writing in the report, the finance ministry's officials said there is ""considerable scope for the growth rate to rise well above 7 percent by 2030"" on account of the pace with which physical infrastructure is being built, strengthening of balance sheets, improvement in institutional efficiency due to rapidly expanding digital infrastructure, and technological progress picking up pace with increasing overseas collaboration.Highlighting the economy's 7 percent-plus growth rate between 2014 and 2019 despite an ""insipid"" global economic backdrop, the finance ministry said it is ""eminently possible for the Indian economy to grow in the coming years at a rate above 7 percent"" given the strength of the financial sector and ""other recent and future structural reforms"".To be sure, the report said ""only the elevated risk of geopolitical conflicts"" is a concern.In terms of future reform priorities, it included skilling, learning outcomes, health, energy security, reduction in compliance burden for micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and gender balancing in the labour force.""Furthermore, under a reasonable set of assumptions with respect to the inflation differentials and the exchange rate, India can aspire to become a $7 trillion economy in the next six to seven years (by 2030).

105,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/the-worlds-forests-are-doing-much-better-than-we-think-12142341.html,The world’s forests are doing much better than we think,"January 29, 2024 10:45 AM IST","The UK as a whole has nearly three times as much forest as it did at the start of the 20th century. China’s forests have increased by about 607,000 square kilometers since 1992, a region the size of Ukraine. The European Union has added an area equivalent to Cambodia to its woodlands. But Brazil alone removed enough woodland since 1992 to counteract all the growth in China, the EU and US put together","Think of a planet in the grip of climate crisis, and many of the images in your mind will be carved from wood. Forests in Canada and Australia going up in flames; loggers in the jungles of Indonesia and Brazil chain-sawing ancient trees for lumber; monocultural fir plantations marching in geometric order up the hillsides of Scotland or Sweden.You might be surprised to discover, then, that many of the world’s woodlands are in a surprisingly good condition. The destruction of tropical forests gets so much (justified) attention that we’re at risk of missing how much progress we’re making in cooler climates.That’s a mistake. The slow recovery of temperate and polar forests won’t be enough to offset global warming, without radical reductions in carbon emissions. Even so, it’s evidence that we’re capable of reversing the damage from the oldest form of human-induced climate change — and can do the same again.Take England. Forest coverage now is greater than at any time since the Black Death nearly 700 years ago, with some 1.33 million hectares of the country covered in woodlands. The UK as a whole has nearly three times as much forest as it did at the start of the 20th century.That’s not by a long way the most impressive performance. China’s forests have increased by about 607,000 square kilometers since 1992, a region the size of Ukraine. The European Union has added an area equivalent to Cambodia to its woodlands, while the US and India have together planted forests that would cover Bangladesh in an unbroken canopy of leaves.Logging in the tropics means that the world as a whole is still losing trees. Brazil alone removed enough woodland since 1992 to counteract all the growth in China, the EU and US put together. Even so, the planet’s forests as a whole may no longer be contributing to the warming of the planet. On net, they probably sucked about 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere each year between 2011 and 2020, according to a 2021 study. The CO2 taken up by trees narrowly exceeded the amount released by deforestation. That’s a drop in the ocean next to the 53.8 billion tons of greenhouse gases emitted in 2022 — but it’s a sign that not every climate indicator is pointing toward doom.Remarkably, this may not be the first time human activities caused an expansion of the world’s forests. The devastating population declinescaused by war and disease after the European colonisation of the Americas may have caused a downturn in global temperatures between the 16th and 19th centuries, according to one 2019 analysis. With their populationsreduced to about 10 percent of previous numbers, Indigenous people were no longer able to maintain agricultural systems based on clearing land with fire. As a result, 558,000 square kilometers of new woodlands grew, sufficient to lock away about 27 billion tons of CO2.Nor is global afforestation to date caused mainly by environmental imperatives. Indeed, in much of the world, it has been the rise of fossil fuels that turned the corner on deforestation almost a century ago, as industries turned to coal, oil and gas to produce heat and energy in place of wood.More than a quarter of Japan is covered with planted forests that in many cases are so old they’re barely recognised as such. Forest cover reached its lowest extent during World War II, when trees were felled by the million to provide fuel for a resource-poor nation’s war machine. Akita prefecture in the north of Honshu island was so denuded in the early 19th century that it needed to import firewood. These days, its lush woodlands are a major draw for tourists.It’s a similar picture in Scandinavia and Central Europe, where the spread of forests onto unproductive agricultural land, combined with the decline of wood-based industries and better management of remaining stands, has resulted in extensive regrowth since the mid-20th century. Forests cover about 15 percent of Denmark, compared to 2 percent to 3 percent at the start of the 19th century.Even tropical deforestation has slowed drastically since the 1990s, possibly because the rise of plantation timber is cutting the need to clear primary forests. Still, political incentives to turn a blind eye to logging, combined with historically high prices for products grown and mined on cleared tropical woodlands such as soybeans, palm oil and nickel, mean that recent gains are fragile.There’s no cause for complacency in any of this. The carbon benefits from forests aren’t sufficient to offset more than a sliver of our greenhouse pollution. The idea that they’ll be sufficient to cancel out gross emissions and get the world to net zero by the middle of this century depends on extraordinarily optimistic assumptions on both sides of the equation.Still, we should celebrate our success in slowing a pattern of human deforestation that’s been going on for nearly 100,000 years. Nothing about the damage we do to our planet is inevitable. With effort, it may even be reversible.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Infrastructural development plays a key role in the economic development of a nation, and consequently, the infra sector in India has seen a lot of budgetary and policy support from the Union government over the last few years.The National Investment Pipeline (NIP), launched in 2020, has been one of the most ambitious projects of the Indian government, which envisaged an investment of more than Rs 1.5 lakh crore for 9,500+ projects across the roads, generation, transmission & distribution, ports, waterways, and other sectors. Additionally, the framework laid out in the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) has also boosted the monetisation of various brownfield assets to support the investment requirement of the NIP. However, expedited infrastructure development and the need for private capital for it continue to be a major hurdle for India’s economic growth and need further improvements.Since the introduction of Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) in the Indian market in 2014, they have played a critical role in attracting private capital to the infrastructure sector through foreign as well as domestic investors. InvITs have emerged as a platform for enabling democratic ownership of infrastructure assets. With enhanced governance and ease of doing business through the wonderful work done by the Ministry of Finance and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), InvITs have seen enthused involvement from institutional and retail investors for participation in sectors like roads, pipelines, and transmission.InvITs rely on the central theme of brownfield asset monetisation which provides them with an avenue for growth while freeing up government/developer capital for further investments. Frameworks like NMP and Acquire, Operate, Maintain, and Transfer (AOMT) are critical cogs for driving the growth of InvITs. However, what becomes paramount is the monetisation of assets through competitive bidding, which ensures true price discovery and provides transparency to investors.Budgetary support needs of InvITsIndia has 23 InvITs registered with SEBI, 20 of which are listed either publicly or privately. Together, they have over Rs 2 lakh crore of assets under their management. This asset class is yet to unlock its true potential, which can create a capital investment of about Rs 8 lakh crore over the next four to six years.However, to increase the attractiveness of InvITs as an investment diversification opportunity for retail and institutional investors, we need policy upgrades, among other things, to:Classify InvITs and REITs as equity or equity-like instruments, which will act as a significant catalyst for attracting a larger pool of investments into these instruments,Allow InvITs to participate in mainstream indices to boost liquidity and market depth, widen the investor base through ETFs, and help in better price discovery,Equalise the holding period requirement for listed units of InvITs in line with equity shares at 12 months instead of 36 months for computing LTCG,Enable external commercial borrowings (ECBs) for InvITs to help them diversify their lender base as well as increase debt tenure and market depth,Enable EPFO and provident funds to invest in InvITs through units and debt securities, as well as increase investment limits for insurance companies and pension funds from the current 3 percent to 10 percent.Overall, we hope that the Union Budget this year focuses on the inclusion of policy changes and provides higher allocations to areas that expedite the implementation of reforms while allowing for the inclusion of diverse funding avenues.Harsh Shah is the CEO of IndiGrid.

However, it would only be around 10.3 percent higher than the budget estimate of Rs 10 lakh crore for the current financial year which, in turn, was a huge 33.4 percent higher than the budget estimate for 2022-23. The capex growth slowdown in seen as being key to the government's effort to cut its fiscal deficit to achieve the medium-term objective of 4.5 percent of the GDP by 2025-26.According to economists, the government may revise down its capex for the current financial year by around Rs 30,000 crore to Rs 9.7 lakh crore. As such, a budget estimate of Rs 11 lakh crore for 2024-25 would represent an increase of 13.4 percent over the revised estimate.""Based on our estimates of receipts and revenue expenditure, we think this fiscal deficit target would allow for a budgeted capex of Rs 10.2 lakh crore in 2024-25, implying a relatively sedate year-on-year expansion of around 10 percent, compared to over 20 percent expansion seen in each of post-Covid years,"" analysts from ratings agency ICRA said, adding that ""higher amount of capex would impinge on the Centre's ability"" in meeting the fiscal deficit target for 2025-26.OrganisationFY25 Capex Estimate (in Rs lakh crore)ICRA10.2ANZ10.5IDFC First Bank10.77DBS Bank10.9CareEdge11.0Deutsche Bank11.0Nomura11.03Kotak Institutional Equities11.22Elara Capital11.4Barclays11.5BofA Securities11.5ICICI Bank11.5Motilal Oswal Financial Services11.51Bank of Baroda11.5-12.0India Ratings10.7As per a Moneycontrol poll, the Centre may look to lower its fiscal deficit to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2024-25 from 5.9 percent in the current financial year.Even at Rs 11 lakh crore, the Centre's capex push would remain firm. However, there have been indications for some time that the pace of capex growth has to slow down. In fact, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran had warned in the run-up to last year's Budget that public capex cannot keep increasing as rapidly as it has in recent years for two reasons: it may not be necessary as private capex steps up and continued strong growth in public capex could push up the cost of capital.There are already signs that capex growth has started to cool, which is why economists see the Budget estimate of Rs 10 lakh crore being missed.""On a six-month rolling sum basis, capex growth has moderated from 50.7 percent to less than 9 percent,"" noted Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi.As per latest data, the Centre has fallen behind the run-rate needed to meet its capex target, with the figure for April-November 2023 standing at Rs 5.86 lakh crore, or 58.5 percent of the target.Budget 2024 Expectations: LIVE Blog News UpdatesKeeping with past trends, the capex allocation for next year will likely be dominated by defence, railways, and roads and highways. Further, the allocation for the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment – or long-term, interest-free capex loans for states – may also be raised from Rs 1.3 lakh crore this year. However, states are lagging when it comes to utilising this scheme.""We expect states to fall short by Rs 20,000-30,000 crore in availing this facility. Thus, even with higher allocation next year, states' capacity to undertake more capex and infra spending may be nearing their limit,"" Madhavi Arora and Harshal Patel, economists with Emkay Global Financial Services, noted."

A reduction in borrowing from the market to finance the deficit is also likely.At 5.3 percent, the expected fiscal deficit target for the next financial year would be 60 basis points lower than the objective for 2023-24, which is widely believed to be met, despite higher-than-expected expenditure and lower nominal GDP growth, thanks to a rapid surge in tax collections.One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.Also read: GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicated""Concerns surrounding fiscal slippage in an election year are understandable.

However, economists are not perturbed by the possibility that the full Budget will be presented in the second half of 2024 in July.""While the 2024-25 budget is an 'interim' one ahead of the general elections due in April-May, we find that the fiscal targets in the interim and final budgets in the past two election years were largely similar. Hence, the government's fiscal intent is likely to remain largely unchanged in the final budget,"" according to Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi.Continued consolidationWith just two years left for the Centre to meet its medium-term fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent, a sizeable reduction is expected in 2024-25.

In net terms – after adjusting for repayments for bonds maturing this year – the Union government's borrowing is seen at Rs 11.5 lakh crore, around Rs 30,000 crore lower than in 2023-24.While the borrowing is set to remain at elevated levels, the demand-supply dynamics which determine the cost of borrowing are set to be very much in favour of the government thanks to the inclusion of Indian government bonds on JPMorgan's global indices starting June and maybe even Bloomberg's indices starting September.

Apart from the UAE, Saudi Arabia has deposited USD 5 billion with the State Bank of Pakistan.Following the loan rollover by the UAE, the interim government requested the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to dispatch a new mission this month for talks for the last loan tranche of USD 1.2 billion. The IMF’s next mission is critical for not only securing the last loan tranche but also for beginning negotiations for a new long-term programme.While speaking to a private TV news channel recently, former finance minister Ishaq Dar said in case his party – the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) – won the elections and formed the government, the decision about the new IMF programme would be made at the earliest.Dar, the four-time finance minister of the country, added that in case his party decided not to enter the IMF programme, it would immediately start implementing the belt-tightening measures.The IMF has made new adjustments in its fresh staff-level report about the available financing to Pakistan. The Washington-based lender has increased the projection of budget support loans to USD 3 billion but cut the project financing to USD 3.7 billion for this fiscal year.The overall external financing requirements have been reduced to a little under USD 25 billion with minor downward adjustments in the current account deficit projections, the report said.The report suggested the global lender had made a minor adjustment of USD 575 million in its current account deficit projection in comparison with July’s estimates. The IMF has now projected the deficit at USD 5.7 billion or 1.6 per cent of the GDP – an estimate that appeared on the higher end.Pakistan is in economic ruin and awaiting a monumental financial default without long overdue structural reforms sought by global creditors such as the IMF and the World Bank, along with bilateral partners like China and the UAE.The primary reason behind Pakistan’s economic woes is its staggering debt levels, which, as of 2023, amount to nearly USD 125 billion owed to external creditors, with approximately one-third to China."

At first glance, there appears to be little need for handouts, what with real GDP growth widely expected to be around 7 percent for the next few years. Corporate and bank balance sheets are in fine shape and investment demand is powering the economy. Bank credit is growing robustly. The stock markets are scaling new highs. It’s true that the pre-election interim Budget of 2019 was a populist one, as we pointed out here. But then, real GDP growth in 2023-24 is estimated at 7.3 percent while it was 6.5 percent in 2018-19. Surely, the economy can now do without new sops?But look under the hood and a rather different picture emerges. First and foremost, as the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor points out, the overall deficit of the Centre and the states is estimated to be 8.8 percent of GDP in 2023-24, compared to 6.4 percent in 2018-19. And the gross debt of the Centre and the states is estimated at 81.9 percent of GDP in 2023-24, against 70.4 percent of GDP in 2018-19. What’s more, the central government has promised to prune its fiscal deficit down to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26, from the current fiscal year’s estimate of 5.9 percent. Hence, the need for substantial fiscal consolidation. That’s why IndusInd Bank chief economist Gaurav Kapur wrote here: “The Budget should thus focus on strengthening the long-term growth impulses provided by public investments, building fiscal buffers to counter future shocks, and putting public debt on a downward path to free up space for productive spending.”But there’s a catch. Consumption growth, the GDP estimates show, will be the lowest in many years in the current fiscal year. Growth in the farm sector is estimated to be a mere 1.8 percent year-on-year. Average real rural wages for men in November, the latest month for which data are available from the Labour Bureau, show y-o-y growth of a piffling 0.2 percent. Rural food inflation, which was 0.2 percent in 2018-19, was at 8.97 percent in December 2023.  Moreover, our columnist Latha Venkatesh wrote that Niti Aayog’s claim of a steep fall in poverty in the last nine years doesn’t pass the smell test. The flip side of the rising premiumisation in consumer markets is the poor performance of the mass market. The government’s Periodic Labour Force data show a rising proportion of unpaid helpers among those considered to be employed. And let’s not forget that 80 crore Indians are still getting 5 kgs of foodgrain free every month—If they were really doing well, why do they need the subsidy?For all these reasons, there’s a possibility that the Budget may go in for more handouts this year too, or at least increase spending in rural areas.But it’s not a foregone conclusion. One difference between the last interim Budget and now is that in 2018-19, the construction sector was growing at 6.5 percent, while it’s estimated to grow 10.7 percent in 2023-24, thanks to the government’s capex push. That should provide more employment for the masses. In other words, instead of increasing consumption subsidies, the government must continue its capex push, perhaps increasing the incentives for its affordable housing and other programmes aimed at augmenting capital expenditure by the corporate sector. That, combined with fiscal consolidation and low government borrowing, would reinforce the incipient capex recovery and lead to a new growth cycle. A great opportunity is the capex needed for the transition to a green economy. After all, the growth spurts of the East Asian economies were on account of strong and sustained high capital investment to GDP ratios—in China, for example, is excess of 40 percent.  Funding, of course, can easily be arranged if the government goes in for disinvestment, privatisation and asset monetisation. Putting in place such a framework for long-term growth would be the ideal Budget for the markets. Do keep a close watch on our recommendations after the Budget this year, especially after the stellar performance of our MC Pro Budget 2023 Portfolio. Cheers, Manas Chakravarty Here are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets: Stocks Zee Entertainment, Paytm, Persistent Systems, Metro Brands, Colgate, Axis Bank, Polycab, Cyient DLM, Sona BLW, TVS,  Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra, JSW Energy, Pidilite Industries, Havells India, Laurus LabsBudget 2024 Cement supply uptick may keep prices in check Defence capex sees renewed thrust Scope to unlock tourism potential What past performance tells us of market behaviour on Interim Budget day Govt support key to India’s electrification story Companies and industry IDFC First Bank’s 5-year plan, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra, Zee Entertainment, Tata Steel,  Sony needs to introspect on why it signed up to a merger of unequals Indian oil and gas firms must pay more attention to geopolitical risks Fintechs must realise that the time for reckoning is nigh Markets Markets near peaks: should investors book profits or hold? Did the SEBI FPI ownership norm cause the market to fall? Badla financiers are alive and flourishing Why 2024 can be the year of bond revival Financial Times Grumbles about passive investing may have a point Martin Wolf: The dangers lurking in our messy and unpredictable world Biden’s green spending splurge is a hard model to copy Inside Edge Oracle punters piggyback on Tortoise fund, HDFC Bank loyalist perseveres, operators go loco on IRCTC AK-47 has Rain in his crosshairs, contra view on Sanghi Industries, Zee drama—the next act Economy and policy Electronics—let the export edge give impetus to local manufacturing A robust bus transport system is essential for cities to thrive Pro Economic Tracker Personal Finance After 80% returns in one year, does CPSE ETF still make sense? Children settled abroad?

But for all its doubters, the US economy and markets continue to shock the world. For a moment at least, that’s worth celebrating.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, exceeding every forecast compiled by Bloomberg and helping validate record stock prices. And it’s largely happened on the back of strong consumption.Real personal consumption expenditures expanded at a 2.8% annualized pace in the quarter, with about 55% of that coming from services (including dining out, healthcare and recreation) and the balance from goods (clothing, durable goods, etc.)The numbers cap a year of positive economic surprises that defied predictions of imminent doom with policy rates at two-decade highs. They also show how the legacy of pandemic-era stimulus programs is still being written, with the infamous “stimulus checks” contributing to inflation on the one hand but also catalysing the start of a durable economic expansion. While the former initially got most of the attention, 2023 ended with inflation essentially back at the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and the consumer-driven economy still going strong.So what happened?For the past several years, the US economy has traded leadership between goods and services. During the heart of the pandemic, consumers deployed government checks on appliances and personal electronics and the services economy muddled through a deep recession. Having exhausted their need for appliances and TVs, consumers abandoned goods and went all-in on concerts, live sports and dining out from 2021 to early 2023. Finally, by the second half of 2023, our mini “goods recession” had ended but our newly rediscovered love of real-life experiences remained strong.Admittedly, American consumers will need money if this is going to continue, which means the labour market will have to stay strong and wage increases will have to keep coming in ahead of inflation. For that to happen without juicing future prices too much again, the US needs a sustainable run of strong labour productivity growth, the recipe that fuelled the remarkable growth and stock-market gains of the 1990s. That’s asking for a lot, but it’s hardly out of the question.In the popular imagination, productivity growth requires rapid adoption of futuristic technologies such as artificial intelligence, but there are still more mundane reservoirs of untapped productivity. Workers hired in the frenzied pandemic and post-pandemic labour markets are maturing into their roles, and employer-employee matching should steadily improve to marry the right opportunities with the ideal skill sets. Meanwhile, strong manufacturing investment fuelled by the Biden Administration’s economic initiatives should also help.As for companies, there’s hope that they may have taken lessons from the last four years that make them more efficient overall. Among other things, the pandemic experience taught everyone how to use work-from-anywhere technology. In the ensuing months and years, managers have had time to figure out whether office, remote or hybrid work best serves their companies and industries’ objectives and maximizes output. It’s been a rocky experimentation process for some, but those learnings should pay off in the medium-run. So too should the lessons of managing costs through an inflation scare.This may all read like a lot of wishful thinking, and I understand the sentiment. Among other things, interest rates are still high, and the massive US housing market is still in a strange state of paralysis. You also can’t write off the possibility of a resurgence in inflation amid Houthi militant attacks in the Red Sea, especially if the recent surge in freight costs is sustained.But at present, the US consumer story is trouncing the inflation story and making America look like a star on the world stage. For a moment, let’s all live in the present and celebrate that. Jonathan Levin  is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication"

This kind of active resistance by parliamentarians and civil society is essential, and should continue. Indonesia’s democracy is in its infancy","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As deepfakes go, it’s not a great one. Even so, the viral video of Indonesia’s former president and dictator Suharto that was created using artificial intelligence took the world’s most populous Muslim nation by storm. It racked up millions of views on social media, and prompted hand-wringing about the dangers of using this kind of technology.“I am President Suharto, the second president of Indonesia, inviting you to elect representatives of the people from Golkar,” the figure in the video says. The man behind it, Erwin Aksa, is a member of Golkar, the political party the former leader presided over for the 32 years he was in power. It is the nation’s oldest operating party, stemming from the New Order era, one of the most corrupt dictatorships in Southeast Asia’s history. The party was hugely powerful and influential, and all government employees were expected to vote for it.Turns out running a country is pretty easy, when you control everything. Golkar hasn’t had that kind of power since Suharto fell amid the unrest that engulfed the archipelago in 1998. But as citizens get ready to elect their next president on Feb. 14, Aksa said on Instagram that the video was intended to remind people of their responsibility to make the right decisions.Suharto’s appeal, despite his authoritarianism, is not new. During the 2014 elections, I travelled to his hometown in Kemusuk in Central Java, as millions prepared to directly elect only their third president since the transition from dictatorship to democracy began. It was hard to miss the love that many still have for the man they affectionately call “the father of the nation.” At the time, T-shirts featuring his face were being sold, with slogans in Javanese saying: “It was better in my time, wasn’t it?”This desire for a return to perceived stability is not unusual, but it is worrying given Indonesia’s importance in regional power dynamics. It’s the world’s most populous Muslim country, and Southeast Asia’s largest economy. It is a critical partner for the US in its ambitions to curtail China’s rise, and is also a valuable modern Muslim ally. A creep toward authoritarianism, however small, must be avoided at all cost.Indonesians look at their young democracy differently from the Western world, which has traditionally prioritized aspects like freedom of the press and checks and balances in government, argues Deasy Simandjuntak, visiting researcher at the Singapore-based Institute of Southeast Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute. They look at the government’s performance, and whether policy aims have been fulfilled. Social welfare and economic development trump democracy and civil rights — which is understandable when you look at the size and scale of the country. It is massive: From west to east it spans the distance between London and Baghdad, with three time zones and hundreds of different ethnic groups and languages. Even in one of the richest parts of the country — the capital Jakarta — very basic needs, like putting food on the table, can often be hard to meet.These levels of hardship provide an explanation for the rise in popularity of one of the presidential candidates in this election, Prabowo Subianto. He’s a former special-forces commander with outsized influence during the New Order and was dishonourably discharged in the aftermath of its collapse for alleged human-rights violations. For a time, he was Suharto’s son-in-law. Prabowo is offering economic stability and a continuation of the rule under the current leader Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi.Prabowo is leading in the polls, although early indications suggest a run-off is likely. Standing against him are two former governors — Anise Baswedan of Jakarta and Ganjar Pranowo of Central Java — who have yet to create much traction with the public.It can’t be overstated just how tumultuous the period preceding Suharto’s fall was, and the chaos that ensued in its aftermath. I saw the beginnings of the economic mayhem caused by the Asian Financial Crisis that culminated in deadly riots that eventually forced Suharto to step down. At that point, it looked like the scenario many of us feared could almost happen: the total disintegration of an impossible state that had been held together not by any sense of nationhood — but the idea that this disparate group of people spread out across 17,000 islands could somehow be united in a country.Much of that was down to the former dictator’s iron-fisted rule, and his use of the military to quell unrest. But Indonesia since has become the poster child for democracy in Southeast Asia, and has had a remarkably successful transition after the initial years of disorder. It was out of this new and refreshed political system that the president for the past decade, Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, emerged — ostensibly a man of the people, a democrat who was not connected to the cronyism and capitalism of the previous era.Prabowo, 72, and Jokowi, 62 are highly intelligent political operators with polar opposite public personalities — one a swaggering ex-general, the other a soft-spoken furniture maker. They each offer a type of charisma that appeals to a large number of Indonesians. Prabowo has his own party and isn’t even a member of Golkar, whose current candidate doesn’t rate compared to a long-dead dictator.Now, history is repeating itself. Jokowi’s eldest son Gibran Rakabuming Raka is Prabowo’s choice of running mate in what is  seen as a sign that nepotism and cronyism, hallmarks of the Suharto era, are returning to haunt yet another generation. Jokowi defeated Prabowo twice for the presidency, but they have since made a pragmatic peace and the former general is currently defence minister. The worries about the damage to democracy have led to rumours and speculation that high-profile members of Jokowi’s cabinet are considering resigning, although the president has issued stern denials.This kind of active resistance by parliamentarians and civil society is essential, and should continue. Indonesia’s democracy is in its infancy. If it was a person, it would barely be out of university, just starting to make their way in the world. Learning from the past is instructive: Bringing that period back is not.Karishma Vaswani   is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication"

Although current output is a tiny percentage of global supply, the nation is sitting on around 17% of known reserves, second only to China. It’ll take time and money to develop the mining and metallurgical skills needed to turn all that raw dirt into cash, but the rewards are there for the taking","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vietnam’s hopes of becoming a production hub to rival China are showing momentum. A big boost will come as the nation leans into its untapped reserves of rare earths, even as it struggles to find traction in new sectors such as electric vehicles.Over the past decade, the country has built a beachhead in manufacturing, ranging from cars to electronics. Computers and accessories are now the largest export, surpassing textiles and footwear. The expansion of foreign assemblers like Foxconn Technology Group, GoerTek Inc. and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. mean that Apple Inc. products like Macs and AirPods are made locally. While that energy has spurred the birth of other businesses, some have stumbled. Electric-vehicle maker VinFast Auto Ltd., for example, last week posted full-year shipments that missed its own forecast by more than 20%.Although Apple now has 25 supplier sites in Vietnam, that still pales in comparison to 151 for China and 41 in Taiwan. A key reason is the high concentration of component manufacturers in China. The transfer out of China into India, Vietnam, and Mexico has largely revolved around the final stage of the process when devices are put together like Lego. There’s been very little movement at the other end of the supply chain, where parts like chips, magnets, and diodes are produced.Rare earth minerals are uncommon — though the moniker “rare” is debated — yet crucial to modern industry. Many have unique electrical and magnetic properties that make them useful in electronics, EVs, medical equipment and lasers.Vietnam’s abundance of these ores is catching the attention of its government as well as foreign leaders. Its own hopes for the sector are bold. From just 400 tons of rare-earth-oxides produced in 2021, output shot up to 4,300 tons in 2022. That’s just 1.4% of global supply, and far behind the 210,000 tons from China, according to estimate by the US Geological Survey. In July, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha approved plans to supercharge expansion, aiming to process as much as 62,500 tons of rare-earth minerals by 2030.During a trip to Vietnam in September, US President Joe Biden inked a deal with the Southeast Asian nation to open up to foreign investment in the rare-earth sector. Reducing reliance on China was the stated goal, as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington continue to simmer.So far, the Vietnamese government’s policies to boost capacity are a mix of carrot and stick. It offers tax incentives, a simplified licensing process and dedicated industrial zones. Yet it also imposes curbs on exports and has quotas on how much of the raw ore dug out of the ground must get processed locally, instead of sent abroad. That stipulation has already tripped up executives, with the chairman of one mine operator arrested in October and accused of tax evasion and illegally exporting raw minerals to China to avoid high refining costs.Soon afterward, Perth-based Blackstone Minerals Ltd. affirmed plans to secure the rights to mine the Dong Pao concession in the northwest, despite its local partner being among those caught up in the scandal. “Vietnam has the potential to be a significant contributor to the global rare earth supply chain and Blackstone remains committed to helping Vietnam realize this ambition,” it said in an Australian Stock Exchange filing.Vietnam’s aggressive plans are bound to hit such speed bumps. Foreign mining companies, which have the technical skill and financial capital to extract and process the ore, will be key to making it happen. And overseas interest remains strong right through the value chain. Seoul signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a  system for rare earths in order to offer South Korean companies in the automobile and electronics sectors stable access.These deals are as crucial to the broader economy’s future as any agreements for extracting and processing minerals. South Korea’s Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co., Infineon Technologies AG of Germany, and Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp. have operations in the country, chiefly to make semiconductors. More importantly, global magnet makers have been lured to Vietnam’s shores, too. Star Group Industrial Co. and Baotou INST Magnetic will soon join Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. with local factories.This is the right direction. While it would be easy for policymakers to lean on cheap labour and simple assembly to provide thousands of jobs for blue-collar workers, it has a much better shot of building a robust future by tapping into its unique advantage underground. In luring the companies that turn rare earths into electronic components, it can build a knowledge-based economy that’s much more resilient to changes in labour costs.Although current output is a tiny percentage of global supply, the nation is sitting on around 17% of known reserves, second only to China. It’ll take time and money to develop the mining and metallurgical skills needed to turn all that raw dirt into cash, but the rewards are there for the taking. Vietnam may never replace China as the global centre of manufacturing, but it has a good shot at being the next-best alternative.Tim Culpan  is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

With broader access to credit, private consumption, which is expanding 3 percentage points slower than the economy’s overall 7%-plus growth rate, could become more stable","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Depending on whom you ask, consumer credit in India is either growing too rapidly or not trickling down fast enough. Bankers speak with awe of the industry’s phenomenal expansion, which is so fast-paced that the regulator is starting to get concerned. Fintech players like to draw attention to its lopsided distribution. The industry keeps chasing a fraction of affluent urban professionals to the exclusion of everyone else. Broaden access, they say, and the scorching growth may become more sustainable.For lenders, however, the problem with adding new borrowers is the incremental cost. The economics of even modest democratization — to a wider section of regular wage earners, for instance in factory townships — makes the concept a nonstarter.Take credit cards, of which there are nearly 100 million in circulation. It’s a small number for a country of 1.4 billion people, but double from five years ago, underscoring significant expansion. And yet, it’s the same group of 40 million well-heeled Indians who keep getting more cards. Fewer than 13% of Indians over 15 years of age borrow from formal sources, including credit cards. In China, the number is nearly 40%, thanks to a multiyear boom in digital lending before a regulatory crackdown on Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the two major players.During the pandemic, India saw an invasion of sorts by predatory Chinese lending apps, but the regulators have chased them away. Out of more than 60 banks in India, about 75% of the entire credit-card franchise by value is with just four — HDFC Bank Ltd., State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd., and Axis Bank Ltd. The reason more lenders aren’t interested in getting into the business or expanding it is that the cost of acquiring and servicing customers works out to about 6,000 rupees ($70) per client, including specialized software for collection and risk management. It isn’t possible to recoup this expense from the spending of someone earning, say, 40,000 rupees a month, middle of the range for what an outsourcing company typically pays fresh coding talent.But what if there was a way? Not with expensive credit-card architecture, but by employing India’s ubiquitous smartphone-based payment protocol that logged more than 100 billion transactions last year.Unified Payments Interface is used by 300 million Indians to instantly settle bills. Even the smallest of shopkeepers accept UPI payments. Alphabet Inc.’s Google recommended its open architecture to the Federal Reserve as a template for FedNow, the new interbank settlement service that launched in the US last year. So far, though, UPI users have only spent money they already have on deposit with banks. But now lenders have been cleared by the regulator to offer credit. Any person scanning QR codes at more than 50 million merchants will have the option of paying from a credit line, if she happens to have one.That still leaves banks with the original problem: How do they know if modest earners can handle unsecured loans, especially if they have limited credit history? “When you go below incomes of 100,000 rupees a month, the quality of financial services starts dropping meaningfully,” says Piyush Bagaria, a co-founder at SalarySe. It’s a fintech startup connecting with large employers’ human-resource databases so that employees who want revolving credit can consent to sharing their authentic wage data and employment history with lenders. After that they will use the SalarySe app to pay merchants over UPI from an approved credit line. “The line will be settled from next month’s salary,” Bagaria said.Banks will garner an interchange fee from merchants, though they will only earn interest when customers opt to settle in monthly instalments. Bypassing card networks will reduce the lenders’ cost of acquiring and servicing lower-income consumers. Knowing that repayments will be automatically collected out of a regular salary will give them comfort. They could offer credit lines anywhere from 0.7 times for those trying to build a credit history to up to three times monthly income for more mature clients. Credit risk will become more manageable. SalarySe, which recently raised $5.25 million from investors including Peak XV’s Surge platform and Pravega Ventures, has set itself an ambitious goal of bringing credit to 10 million salaried Indians in three years.This is just one of many models that will emerge over the coming months. After all, the whole intention behind UPI as a public utility is to foster experimentation in an open marketplace, where small startups have as much of a shot at success as large players. And Big Tech is already sensing the potential. Google Pay, which has a one-third share of money that moves on the payment protocol, has tied up with banks that want to offer credit lines. In early trials, Google has said that half of such loans went to people earning less than 30,000 rupees, and that a vast majority of these credit customers are from smaller towns.Consumer loans in India are on a tear. More recently, Paytm, the homegrown fintech pioneer, has pulled back from the buy-now-pay-later craze by slowing third-party bank loans on its online network by 4% in a quarter. Even then, the year-on-year growth rate is 56%. For the sake of financial stability, the Reserve Bank of India is trying to quieten things down by increasing risk weights and forcing banks to bring in more loss-absorbing capital.But even as it grows, credit can still become safer if UPI spreads access to a wider group of borrowers and draws in more lenders.The payment utility is already moving $2.2 trillion annually as people settle daily transactions with money they have earned. Letting middle-class households spend a part of next month’s wage over the network might help them deal better with shocks. For six out of 10 Indians, raising emergency funds from any source would be very difficult, if not impossible. With broader access to credit, private consumption, which is expanding 3 percentage points slower than the economy’s overall 7%-plus growth rate, could become more stable. Income gaps would still remain acute, but consumption inequalities could reduce a little.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication"

Energy security and gender budgeting are interrelated, given that energy is the key enabler when it comes to women’s social and economic empowerment ","Countries globally are struggling to meet the world’s rising energy demand and the conversation around energy security is more important than ever. Concurrently, nations are realising how important it is for women to be empowered for society to flourish. According to global research, closing the gender gap in the workforce can boost the global GDP by 26 percent adding $28 trillion to the economy. The energy industry must harness the benefits associated with gender diversity and gain from the diverse perspectives and innovations that women bring to the table. Furthermore, the allocation of budgetary resources is a less recognised but important aspect of this equation, directing the course of these interwoven themes.Big Strides In Gender InclusivityThe Union Budget is one of the most closely tracked events that aims to promote social justice and equality while encouraging quick and balanced economic growth in the country. Over the past few years, the government has been pushing for higher fund allocations towards schemes that empower women. As a woman in business, I expect Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to push the pedal for accelerating inclusive development.The 18th G20 Summit, under the Indian Presidency, showcased India’s dedication towards championing gender equality, as was evident in the New Delhi Leaders Declaration 2023. With its single-minded focus on enhancing economic and social empowerment, bridging the gender digital divide, driving gender-inclusive climate action, and securing women’s food security, nutrition, and well-being, India showed the way for prioritising gender inclusivity. Topping this has been the historic Women's Reservation Bill 2023, which was passed in Parliament with a thumping majority.Ramping up gender budgeting is an important and continuous commitment toward ensuring crucial budgetary decisions reflect a genuine investment in the empowerment of women and girls. It is an essential tool to help dismantle deeply entrenched gender disparities. The previous budget was promising in this regard, with the total allocation for gender budgeting marked at Rs 2.23 lakh crore, 30% higher than the budget estimates of 2021–22 spread across women and child development, rural development, education, health and family welfare, and agriculture and farmers' welfare.Gender Budgeting PrioritiesThis year, we hope that both the quality and quantum of budgetary allocation will be enhanced considerably. Some areas where the disbursement is both urgent and justified include: Energy security and gender budgeting are interrelated, given that energy is the key enabler when it comes to women’s social and economic empowerment. Alongside introducing new schemes, strengthening the already existing schemes for women’s welfare in the energy sector will go a long way in ensuring gender equality. Some crucial schemes that could benefit from the fiscal impetus include the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which provides free LPG connections to those women in need, the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya) which provides free electricity connections to poor households, the Kisan Urja Suraksha Evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (KUSUM) which provides financial and technical support for solar pumps and grid-connected solar power plants for farmers; the Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana, which supports women farmers in adopting sustainable agricultural practices; and the Mahila E-Haat, which provides an online platform for women entrepreneurs to sell their products and services which include renewable energy products. Schemes that promote gender equality and women's leadership in existing energy-related initiatives like the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the National Solar Mission, the National Mission on Biodiversity and Human Well-Being, and the NITI Aayog's Women Entrepreneurship Platform can help ensure that the resources allocated towards gender budgeting are utilized effectively.  Increasing the budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MWCD). While the MWCD received INR 30,007 crore in 2023–24, an increase of around 18% compared to the revised estimates of 2022–23, it is still only 0.7% of the total expenditure and 0.2% of the GDP in 2023–24. For a country where half the population is women and where women voters will surpass male voters in the next five years, spending 0.2% of the GDP is truly negligible. Women And The Energy Sector As we await this year’s budget, let's envision a future where women play an integral role in the energy sector, where they are not merely beneficiaries but are active participants, leaders pushing for new outlooks and innovative ideas. I see the Union Budget 2024–25 not only as a powerful tool that can shape policies, strategically allocate resources to programs that promote gender inclusivity in the energy domain, invest in women-specific education and skill-building initiatives as well as provide incentives for female-led business ventures.  I believe it is also an opportunity for the government to come forth and demonstrate its commitment to achieving energy security and gender equality in India. It’s a chance to walk the talk and make a difference. I speak, not as an optimist, but as a realist, when I say that by adopting a gender-responsive approach to energy security, the government can ensure that the fruits of development reach women who have more of a stake in it. It’s a critical step to empower women as agents of change and leaders in the energy sector. As Dr Kalam once said, “Empowering women is a prerequisite for creating a good nation, when women are empowered, society with stability is assured.""Vaishali Nigam Sinha is Co-founder and Chairperson of Sustainability at ReNew.

But there is a sense of trust among ordinary people in Modi's ability to navigate the challenges, which is further amplified by Opposition parties repeatedly failing to show a viable alternative model of governance","Republic Day is a time of the year when one looks back at the journey that India has travelled so far. We tend to assess what the future looks like from now on.Today, as a nation, we are more confident than hitherto about our future. We are also more hopeful that our lives will get better in the years to come. There is a greater sense of trust in our system than before because of the current political leadership of the government and its capabilities to navigate through challenges that are always on the rise.Undoubtedly, India finds itself at the forefront of global economic resilience, backed by robust government spending with an expected growth rate of 6.9 percent in the current fiscal year – an upgrade from the earlier estimate of 6.7 percent.Political Stability Once the general elections are done, and political stability is assured, things are bound to look up on the economic front.Unless there is the return of a coalition era, which seems unlikely because of the current mood across the country and inability of the opposition to present a viable alternative, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set for a third term.On his return, Modi is certain to pursue bolder policies and tweaks to his existing approach in critical sectors. This should see improvements in employment for job growth so that it matches the overall economic growth rate.A confident Modi hopes that he can effect course corrections so that measures in generating employment and enhancing disposable incomes ensure sustained prosperity.However, challenges for India come from uncertainties in the agriculture sector and lack of peaceful resolutions in conflict-riven zones, attacks on shipping lines in the Red Sea corridors, worries around food inflation, and sluggishness in the rural output and services sector growth.China's pursuit of policies aimed at destabilising the region by pushing nations like the Maldives to shun India, threatening Bhutan and causing a rise in tensions with Taiwan should keep us on alert.There is fear of a fall in the 2023 kharif output due to ""below average"" rainfall in the four-month (June-September) monsoon season because of El Nino conditions.Yet, there is a sense of trust in Modi to handle these challenges. Even his political opponents concede in private conversations.This year, a historic inauguration of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya – three days before Republic Day – has brought a sense of euphoria.Getting Ram Mandir Message RightAmong many Indians, there is a strong feeling that a long standing issue has been resolved following a verdict handed down by the Supreme Court.  By and large, the Muslim community too has accepted it and would want to move on. However, there are some misgivings over continuous litigation over sites where mosques apparently stand over temples.Modi's efforts are to go beyond the Ram temple and project his style of governance as the new template for a ""Ram Rajya.""  Even RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has spoken about why people should stop fighting over petty issues and stay united. “In Ram Rajya, we will have to stop fighting over petty issues. We must move forward with truth, compassion, wisdom, discipline, and charity. Ram Rajya will come by giving up greed and by staying disciplined.”Modi has given out a new mantra linking the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and the prosperity of the nation — “Dev se desh; Ram se Rashtra (from God to country, and from Ram to nation).”  People have cheered this statement though it may sound high on rhetoric. Opposition leaders like Rahul Gandhi have refused to acknowledge the importance of developments in Ayodhya, dismissing the whole thing as a show of the BJP and RSS.To which, Modi has said, ""The construction of this temple of Ram Lalla is also a symbol of peace, patience, harmony, and coordination in Indian society."" The Ram temple, like the removal of Article 370 that gave a special status for Jammu and Kashmir, is seen as fulfilment of a promise made by the BJP.Modi's critics see the January 22 ceremony as the beginning of the election campaign for Modi and shifting towards a Hindutva rashtra. According to them, the pomp-filled display led by the government shows the extent to which the line between religion and state has eroded under Modi. Perhaps, Modi and BJP may hope that opening of the temple brings better electoral dividend.Country In Election ModeBut most of us would agree that, even before the Ram temple opening, Modi has enjoyed the status of being the most popular leader who should not have difficulty in getting the mandate for a third term. Therefore, one should not think that it is only the Ram temple that will give support to Modi. Moreover, a theocratic state is certainly not on Modi's agenda.Modi does not take the Lok Sabha polls, which are to be held in April-May as a foregone conclusion. Rather, he seeks a mandate greater than what he received in 2014 and 2019 to push his ideas further. He wishes to go to the people on the basis of his government's performance and deliverables for the poor in the last decade.Is there an alternative to Modi and his vision for the country? Since 2014 when Modi came to power, the Opposition parties have failed to show a viable alternative model of governance. Recent events have further proved that these parties do not have anything in common other than opposition to Modi. Their hope that the people will eventually lose confidence in him has been belied.On the other hand, a larger section of voters would rather stick with the BJP even if they are not fully satisfied with its rule.The Opposition bloc – INDIA alliance – is itself dismayed by the Congress’s poor performance in the recent polls. The Congress knows it must improve its leadership and create a new poll strategy before the next elections. Opposition parties must unite to prevent the division of non-BJP votes in the next four months. As of now, this is a tall order for the Congress.Till that happens, the people will see a panacea in Modi's priorities to generate jobs, wealth and growth. Indians are known to be patient for tangible results. But they are also ruthless with politicians who are only out to further their ambition.Shekhar Iyer was senior associate editor of Hindustan Times and political editor of Deccan Herald.

Student elections in the University of Delhi has birthed numerous future stalwarts, with the late finance minister Arun Jaitley a former president of the Delhi University Students Union.In a rather partisan crowd of more than a thousand students from one of the University of Delhi's leading colleges, Sitharaman and senior university and college officials were greeted multiple times with cries of 'Jai Shree Ram' and 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai'.The theme of the event was 'Empowering the Youth: Building the Foundations of a Viksit Bharat'.With January 25 being National Voters Day, the finance minister said she was glad the Election Commission of India's awareness campaign called voting a duty and asked the gathered students to not treat Election Day as a holiday.""It has to be 'I'll go cast my vote and I will choose that leader in my constituency who is going to be dedicated to this country'. So be sure that you are choosing the right person,"" Sitharaman said.The finance minister said the difference between the Bharatiya Janata Party government's two terms and the previous governments was the urgency with which the former worked.""If you ask me in the last 10 years what's so different, even governments earlier provided roads, houses, and drinking water down to the level of villages. But, in 2014, there were still a huge number of them waiting for their houses, water, electricity… 50 years went without that sense of urgency.""She also said the two pillars to empower students towards Vikasit Bharat are values – civilisational and nationalistic – and skills and technology.""Today, we see the generations before us who have not seen the fortunate moment, through our eyes can see the restoration of civilisational values as has been seen on the 22nd (of January)… I am sure you saw it. The Pran Pratishtha in Ayodhya was such a wonderful experience. For generations to come, this day will be remembered as a very important civilisational marker."""

However, the general consensus among economists is that India's post-pandemic recovery has been led by the upper class, with growth in demand for premium goods outstripping that for the mass-market segment. This pattern of recovery has been labelled 'K-shaped'.Interestingly, the finance minister's rejection of the K-shaped hypothesis comes days after Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's group chief economic adviser, also said the theory was ""flawed"" and ""prejudiced"". Using a variety of data, including from income tax returns and orders placed on restaurant aggregator apps such as Zomato, Ghosh has claimed the real picture in the hinterlands is rather different than what popular opinion suggests.Addressing the college students on January 25, Sitharaman asked them to access material and information from multiple sources and people instead of believing just one source.While the finance minister said the economy is doing well, she did admit that more effort was needed to bridge the gap between what the industry requires and what the skills of fresh graduates.""Two days ago I had an engagement with the industry… The only worry that the industry has, which is keen to recruit people is as they come out of universities, students are not ready to be straight deployed into a job. There is a gap between what is learnt in these universities and what is the expectation of industries,"" she said.According to the finance minister, while one set of fresh entrants into the work force can get some technical training by industry groups, the skill gap faced by another set of entrants is being bridged by the government at the central and state level.""In this, an addition which we have consciously brought in is training in international languages so that this very same person after a year or two can choose to move to countries where the prospects lie. I know Japanese was brought in this way. Chinese was given as an option, but I don’t know how many have taken it. There are specific concrete efforts being taken but we need to ramp it up and I concede that,"" she said.Also Read: Red Sea crisis fallout may show up in India's January trade dataCommenting on India's food security, the finance minister said the country is nearly self-sufficient in most segments and even exports some of them despite a war, conflict in the Red Sea impeding trade and making movement of foodgrains challenging and costly.""The future is that there are a lot of countries which want to have long-term understanding with India for food exports, processing of food, export of processed food, export of value added food.

127,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/marco-polo-and-the-saga-of-venice-12125631.html,Marco Polo and the saga of Venice,"January 25, 2024 04:07 PM IST","As with all great centers of wealth like London and New York today, Venice glowed even as it slid into political and economic senescence; its residual riches continued to finance art, architecture, music and, though evanescent, a sense of authority and grandeur","The Travels of Marco Polo was a bestseller a century-and-a-half before printing presses changed Western civilisation forever.The book comes down to us through seven centuries, several titles, a number of languages, innumerable textual variations, and perhaps 150 manuscripts from the 14th century alone. But when it first began circulating, the volume had one biting Italian nickname: Il Milione — the million, as in the number of lies to be found within. That was also the word some readers hurled at its Venetian originator, who was certainly aware of the incredulity triggered by his description of the riches and wonders of the empire of Kublai Khan and the Mongols. As he lay dying in January 1324 in Venice, Polo declared to people at his bedside, “I have not told you half of what I saw because I knew I wouldn’t be believed.”On Saturday, Venice combines the septicentennial anniversary of his death with the annual two-week carnivale, the street fair/costume ball that lasts till the eve of Ash Wednesday. According to an Italian tourist website, the theme of this year’s carnival — Ad Oriente, “to the East” — is “travel, discovery and encounters with previously only imagined worlds.” As if tourists need any more encouragement.The truth, of course, is that Marco Polo’s description of points east of Venice ceased being imaginary centuries ago — most famously, or infamously, inspiring Christopher Columbus to undertake treasure-hunting journeys across the Atlantic, landing in the Americas, which just happened to be on the way to China.Philologists have also teased out real-life cities and sites from Polo’s sometimes mysterious place names: Chandu (the Xanadu of Coleridge and Olivia Newton-John) is Shangtu, Chinese for “upper capital,” where the Mongols summered. They wintered in Cambaluc, derived from khanbaliq(Mongol or Uighur for the Khan’s city), which is now Beijing. The word for Polo’s favorite metropolis, Quinsai, comes from the Chinese xingzai(“temporary stay”), a designation that the Southern Song emperors gave Hangzhou, their interim capital, as they dreamed of reconquering lost territory, that is until Kublai’s army put a full stop to those aspirations.Out of the Venetian’s gazetteer, my personal favourite is Zayton —  a city he described as one of the greatest ports in the world and the origin of our “satin.” It is more than likely Quanzhou, the home of my ancestors on the Fujian coast directly across from Taiwan, which Beijing would now like to take back.China and the East have become very real today with the People’s Republic assuming a bellicose role in the rough-and-tumble of superpower geopolitics. What’s become imaginary is Venice.Today, Venice enjoys a false isolation within the lagoon that once kept it safe from invaders for centuries. A sometimes soggy, sometimes fetid, often mesmerizing memento mori of a subcompact empire, it is swamped by tourists from every part of the world. After Polo died, the oligarchic democracy that called itself the Most Serene Republic of Venice endured for another 473 years, until Napoleon and the Austrian Habsburgs forced the last Doge to abdicate. In that half-a-millennium span, Venice, in glory and decline, unfolded as a multifaceted premonition of what the West was to be.As it is now, so it was in Venice hundreds of years ago. The rich got richer by getting into government bonds or prestiti — financial instruments Venice pioneered in Europe — to help defray the many expensive military crisesand existential conflicts it faced with everyone from the Holy Roman Emperor to the Pope to the Ottoman Sultan.Playing and sabotaging markets? Venice has been there and done that. The city possessed a hoard of as much as a quarter of all the silver out of European mines and profited from its price differential with gold. Just as we deal in derivatives today, Venetians brought silver to the Middle East, Egypt and Asia — where it was scarcer — in exchange for gold, which was more valuable in the West. In fact, so much gold that the surplus likely contributed to the 1345 European economic and financial collapse, when a number of important Florentine banks went under. The triggering event was England reneging on its loans, but the seeds of the disruption were likely sown by Venetian commodity trading and the imbalance it introduced into Europe’s various gold-based currencies (which just happened to be rivals of Venice’s coinage).Though it had other city-state rivals, Venice dominated trade between Europe and Asia, Egypt and the Levant for the better part of four centuries. Still, like all other great powers through history, it was also blindsided by technical and commercial innovation and sudden economic coups de theatre. For example, the Portuguese voyages to Asia by way of the Cape of Good Hope took longer to bring back spices and luxuries than the Venetian land routes, but the goods were less costly because sailing cut out the middlemen that the city’s merchants had to pay off. At one point, Venice considered building a canal roughly where Suez is now to connect the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, but the Ottomans got in the way. As for all that silver in Venice’s treasury: Spain’s discovery of mountains of silver in South America deflated the value of La Serenissima’s hoard.The pursuit of power and profit produced the kind of selective xenophobia that nations still practice. Venice loved migrants who were good for its bottom line; otherwise, good luck with residency. The city — which was founded by refugees fleeting the detritus of the Roman Empire — set up the first Jewish ghettos; yet it also encouraged a large degree of religious and philosophical tolerance — if only to spite the Papacy in Rome. Loving the Ottomans for their riches and fearing them for their sweeping military prowess, the Venetians sharpened the practice of diplomatic duplicity, playing multidimensional statesmanship better than many negotiators today. Without much of a citizen soldiery, Venice cultivated the use of mercenaries, just as present-day US and Russia do. If all else failed, there was poison. Sound familiar? And while the city sometimes produced populist figures, it preferred rule by deep state — faceless councils that safeguarded the oligarchy. It also experimented with embryonic forms of the junta (called zonta), which were summoned to deal with emergencies.As with all great centers of wealth like London and New York today, Venice glowed even as it slid into political and economic senescence; its residual riches continued to finance art, architecture, music and, though evanescent, a sense of authority and grandeur. Still, at the very end, Venice was becoming little more than a souvenir painting by Canaletto that the offspring of British plutocrats brought home from their Grand Tours, just as the kids of the rich in China and India sweep up keepsakes today.But the ghosts of the city persist — in Shakespeare’s Othello and The Merchant of Venice, in Thomas Mann’s novella, J.M.W. Turner’s paintings, in the canals and piazzas clogged with tourists, each looking for a personal Venice. My favourite evocation is Italo Calvino’s postmodern masterpiece Invisible Cities. In it, Kublai Khan asks Marco Polo to describe the cities of the empire he rules, which his armies conquered but which he doesn’t really know. Polo, who has traversed it, has that knowledge first hand. And so, the young Venetian goes through a poetic litany of city after fantastical city — in water, on land, in the air, refracted, reflected, hypnotic, accursed — 55 in all.In the end, Kublai Khan realizes what Marco Polo is actually doing: He is describing only one place, Venice, the city he loves and longs to return to after all the years of travel through Asia. The Italian word for city is apt: città — it is both singular and plural. It was Venice’s destiny to prosper and falter in so many ways — and yet linger on today, even if in its haunted state.

In the last one year, the Nifty Auto index zoomed 43 per cent, ahead of the benchmark Nifty 50 that returned about 19 per cent. Auto original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have been spewing out strong sales numbers month after month, underscoring sustained demand. Adding to this are tailwinds from news around product launches and benign raw material prices that have lifted profit margins, after some painful quarters last year.December quarter results of two leading OEMs – Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd- beat expectations on the Street. Double-digit revenue growth compared to the year-ago period and about a 100 basis-points (bps) operating margin expansion justified the narrative of sustained earnings growth. But all this optimism seems to be baked into the respective stock prices. Why the present valuations look elevated is highlighted in MC Pro’s Research team analysis here and here.Over the next few days, more auto OEMs such as Tata Motors, Hero MotoCorp, Eicher Motors are expected to declare their results that are likely to follow a similar trend- strong earnings growth baked into valuations.To be sure, Nifty auto index valuations have come off slightly in the last couple of weeks on reports of demand moderation in some segments such as passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles. Tractors too seen to be going through the cyclical downturn. The high base will affect growth for these segments in the next couple of years.A recent report by BNP Paribas on the Indian automotive landscape highlights reasons why it expects demand growth to moderate to single-digits across the sector over FY2025-26. Economic recovery has not been broad based, which raises concerns on sustaining the strong automotive demand growth. It cites specific reasons such as concerns of K-shaped recovery looming still along with fears of unemployment along with missing real rural wage growth. Meanwhile, news on exports is not comforting enough to offset slowing domestic demand.In other words, it may be prudent for investors to moderate earnings growth expectations from the auto pack. Of course, the Interim Budget ahead of general elections may sprinkle some incentives/subsidies, particularly for rural areas, that may make positive headlines and drive up overall investor sentiment.Auto companies’ strategies to boost demand through new launches and refreshes in the absence of strong underlying success is likely to meet with limited success. Also, the noise around electric vehicles including the expected Ola Electric IPO may help keep investor interest in auto stocks elevated.Investing insights from our research teamTech Mahindra Q3 FY24 – A mixed bag, staring at a reset with the ongoing restructuringWhy 2024 can be the year of bond revivalJSW Energy: Riding ahead of its earnings growthPidilite Industries Q3: Growth stalling, margin strengtheningHavells India Q3: Slow and steadyLaurus Labs: CDMO ramp-up has some runway ahead before it fliesWhat else are we reading?Markets Near Peaks: Should investors book profits or hold?MC Pro Quicktake | Bajaj Auto: Two-wheeler sales rev up to boost Q3 profitsMC Pro Quicktake: Tech Mahindra’s Q3 results hold out hope for investorsZee Entertainment: Can a new cast revive the merger script?Union Budget 2024: Government must focus on capex, fiscal prudence to drive growthBudget Snapshot: Cement supply uptick may keep prices in checkTata Steel Q3: China’s shadow looms over the industry’s profitabilityThe Ram temple and other projects of national rejuvenationColder-for-Longer: Fintechs must realise that the time for reckoning is nighStart-up Street: Follow-on funding challenges for Indian start-upsBiden’s green spending splurge is a hard model to copy (republished from the FT)Maldives could be China’s revenge against India outsmarting it in Bhutan and NepalMacron’s visit reaffirms India’s unique and trusted partnership with FranceMusk waves goodbye to Tesla’s growth targetsPlastic bag bans have failed in every way except oneImpact of Union Budget on the stock market in three chartsIf Congress-TMC talks collapse, who will it benefit in Bengal?Hedge funds are playing a dangerous game on Japan and ChinaPersonal FinanceDCB Happy Savings Account offers cashback on UPI transactions: Should you open one?Tech and StartupsGenerative AI will go mainstream over the next 2-3 years: Persistent Systems CEO Sandeep KalraTechnical Picks: HDFC Bank, Vedanta, Hind Copper and Astral (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Vatsala KamatMoneycontrol Pro"

Of that, the government has raised about Rs 14.08 trillion, or about 91%, as of January 22.But that is already roughly double its gross market borrowings of Rs 7.1 trillion in 2019/20, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.""The government is serious about reducing its market borrowings this fiscal year,"" one of the officials said.Both the officials did not want to be named as they are not allowed to speak to the media about budget plans, which are in the final leg of discussions before they are unveiled next week.The likely gross borrowing figures are also close to economists' estimate of Rs 15.6 trillion, according to a Reuters poll.Despite being an election year where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is bidding for a rare third straight term in power, the government is likely to rein in its fiscal deficit by at least 50 basis points by capping its spending on welfare schemes and subsidies.The Reuters poll also showed economists expect the government to reduce its fiscal deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic output in 2024/25, from 5.9% this year.The Union Finance Ministry did not immediately reply to an email and a message seeking comments."

In 2019, it was the drift of Left voters to the BJP that had enabled the saffron party’s strong performance","As Rahul Gandhi’s election driven Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra enters West Bengal on Thursday the opposition bloc, INDIA, is replete with acrimony at the state level with two key constituents of the bloc – Congress and Trinamool Congress – having stopped short of calling names of each other’s top leadership.Regarding sharing of 42 Lok Sabha seats, multiple statements, often contradictory, have made headlines. Rahul Gandhi said, “seat sharing is underway”, while Mamata Banerjee indicated – via sources – it is over and Trinamool is not keen to leave more than two seats to Congress which had bagged two seats in 2019 Lok Sabha and none in the 2021 Assembly poll.Complicated Bengal CalculusFor the CPI-M led Left Front the choice is clear – they will neither share seats with the Congress if Rahul Gandhi decides to tie-up with Banerjee nor participate in Gandhi’s 2.0 rally on Thursday as it enters the state, if Trinamool joins it.Meanwhile, Left’s biggest ally in state Congress, the beleaguered Pradesh Congress Committee President Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, is systematically echoing CPI-M’s allegation against Trinamool that the ruling party is indulging in “competitive communalism” with the BJP to polarise the poll and thus a seat adjustment with Mamata Banerjee is unacceptable to him. In this context a seat adjustment is unlikely.The question therefore is how the INDIA bloc will suffer if a seat adjustment in Bengal collapses.The answer has two sides to it.At one level, no one will suffer much as neither Congress nor the Left has managed to cut into Trinamool’s vote share over a decade. While Trinamool’s vote increased, Congress-Left’s reduced routinely.Congress got two seats – Baharampur and Malda South – in the last Lok Sabha poll (2019) and Banerjee was willing to leave these two. In a third seat – Murshidabad – Congress bagged the second spot. Fighting independently if Congress wins these three seats – all in Murshidabad district with about 70 percent Muslim population – Banerjee need not worry much as these are traditional Congress bastions.Why Mamata May Prefer Going It AloneRather, if Congress-Left alliance minus Trinamool emerges as a third bloc in the state and manages to increase their share it would be hugely beneficial to Trinamool. Since it is mainly the Left’s anti-Mamata vote that got transferred to the BJP in 2019 Lok Sabha to ensure 18 of 42 seats for the saffron party.Read | TMC-Congress ‘Breakup’: Why Mamata Banerjee’s announcement is mere posturingA rise in Congress-Left vote will automatically reduce BJP’s share as was indicated in 2023 Panchayat poll. Thus, an uptick of at least 5-7 percentage points in Congress-Left bloc votes from 13 percent (2019) is perfect for Trinamool.But a further dip in the Congress-Left share from 13 percent will only benefit the BJP. The saffron party got 40 to Trinamool’s 43 percent in 2019. If the voteshare gap reduces, BJP may overtake Trinamool which is no good news for Banerjee two years before the Assembly poll in 2026, especially at a time when her nephew Abhishek Banerjee is still learning the tricks of the trade.One disadvantage of not aligning with Congress is depletion in Muslim votes. The Muslims are routinely talking about “teaching a lesson” to Banerjee. Without a doubt this is a problem for Banerjee but a slight rise in Congress-Left votes could offset the growing resentment among the minorities.Also Read | Congress panel starts deliberations on manifesto for Lok Sabha pollsThe trend in Bengal in the last decade is interesting – a deeply bipolar poll helps Trinamool in the Assembly but enhances BJP’s share in the Lok Sabha. So for now Banerjee ideally should try to break the pattern and push for a formation when Trinamool and BJP are the main players with a reasonably strong Congress-Left.In case she ties with Congress and leaves the Left in the lurch, it may bite her in the end as more Left voters who are bitterly anti-TMC could switch to BJP. Therefore over the last weeks she has tried her best to distance herself from Congress in the state. At this point it makes sense electorally.Suvojit Bagchi is a Kolkata-based journalist who previously worked with Ananda Bazar Patrika, BBC World Service and The Hindu.

The full Budget for the financial year 2024-25 will be presented by the new government likely in July after the Lok Sabha elections.In the Budget for 2023-24, Sitharaman pegged the gross tax tevenue at about Rs 33.61 lakh crore with an implied tax-GDP ratio of 11.1 percent.The indirect tax collection was estimated at Rs 15.37 lakh crore in the budget estimate (BE) of FY24. Direct taxes comprising corporate tax and income tax were estimated at Rs 18.24 lakh crore for FY24.According to Emkay Research, buoyancy in tax receipts in the current financial year, led more by direct taxes, is likely to result in gross tax collections exceeding the FY24 budget estimate by nearly Rs 55,000 crore.Almost 61 percent of the gross tax collection target for FY24 was met in the first eight months, one of the strongest in years.On indirect taxes, Emkay said the average monthly GST collection rate in FY24 has been healthy. Assuming relatively slower growth in the remainder of FY24, the monthly total GST average will still be close to Rs 1.55 lakh crore, which would imply that total GST collections will likely match the budget estimate of Rs 9.57 lakh crore, almost 10-12 percent higher from the previous year.While bumper RBI dividends have been a big support for non-tax revenues, divestment proceeds have been meagre at Rs 10,000 crore, collected through minority stake sales. At just 20 percent of budget estimate, they face the highest risk of a miss in FY24.New big-ticket proceeds in the rest of the year are unlikely, as two-three of the prospective asset sales face procedural and administrative delays, Emkay said."

But with the base effect normalising and the key Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation so far subdued, nominal growth has come off sharply from 16.1 percent in 2022-23 and 18.4 percent in 2021-22.This is expected to make the Centre's finances more difficult going ahead considering that its committed expenditure – items such as interest payments, salaries, and pensions – can't really be reduced and the focus on capital expenditure remains.However, with the real GDP growth beating all estimates, economists see it as a good opportunity to improve its finances faster.Also Read: India must lower fiscal deficit 'a lot more' to get higher rating, says S&P""We expect the 2024-25 gross fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio to be around 5.4 percent, with an assumption of nominal GDP of around 10.3 percent,"" noted economists Madhavi Arora ansd Harshal Patel of Emkay Global Financial Services.""The government may have to show a sharper pace of consolidation if the 2025-26 goalpost of 4.5 percent is to be met amid debt sustainability.

The composite PMI, meanwhile, rose to 61.0 in January - the joint-highest in six months - from 58.5 in the last month of 2023.This is the first time that flash PMIs are being released for India and comes in the wake of HSBC sponsoring the index compiled by S&P Global.""The Eurozone, France, Germany, the UK, the US, Japan, and Australia already have flash PMIs. And we are delighted to bring the flash PMI to India today to add it those group of significant economies that we currently monitor,"" Luke Thompson, a managing director at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said on January 24.The flash PMIs for January are being released a week ahead of the final number. The manufacturing PMI for India will be released on February 1, just half an hour before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the interim Budget for 2024-25 at 11am. Meanwhile, the services and composite PMIs will be released on February 5.""Essentially, the flash PMI is an early look at what the final PMI numbers will be showing…just to give an even earlier indication of business conditions of the Indian economy,"" Thompson said, adding that the flash number was based on 75-85 percent of the responses S&P Global typically receives for the final PMI number. He further said that the flash PMI is a ""very reliable guide"" to the final number, with the absolute difference between the two being 0.5 on average.""There will be some occasions where the divergence might be slightly greater if there has been a particular event that's happened towards the end of the month. But generally the differences are not large, which means the flash data are giving a reliable signal of the final data,"" Thompson said.Commenting on the flash PMI for January, Pranjul Bhandari, Chief India Economist at HSBC, said the Indian economy grew at a faster pace in January, thanks to stronger manufacturing output and more robust services activity.""New orders rose at a faster pace than a month ago, and within that, international orders were stronger than before,"" she added. According to the PMI report, the increase in international orders was the fastest since October, with overseas demand for goods growing more than services.Input prices for service providers rose the fastest in January since August 2023, while that for manufacturers increased at a pace similar to November and December.""All of last year, when we saw input prices rise, they were on the back of commodity prices rising, like oil. But right now, the rise in input prices seems to be coming more from labour costs. And some of the service providers mentioned that the overtime they are having to pay to some of their labourers to work hard to be able to cater to this new demand is leading to higher wage costs,"" Bhandari said.On the prices charged to consumers, the total rate of charge inflation cooled to a 10-month low, with some respondents noting that they had not raised prices to boost sales."

Some of the loss of status and relevance for the euro will be permanent","The euro celebrates 25 years of virtual existence this month, with its digital creation in 1999 followed by the introduction of physical notes and coins in  2002. It's embedded successfully as the domestic means of exchange within the 20-nation euro zone. While its survival is no longer threatened, the common currency has made little progress in its broader aim of challenging the dollar's role as the world’s reserve currency — and has instead gone backward.De-dollarisation is a perennial theme, but the greenback remains king. The use of the euro in SWIFT transactions — the main global system for cross-border payments — fell to 22 percent by the end of last year from 38 percent in January. The dollar took a corresponding leap, with usage climbing to 48 percent from 40 percent. Most of this was due to a change in market practice when SWIFT changed its calculation method to more accurately measure commercial bank data sent to the European Central Bank; but the common currency has failed to fulfill the aspirations of its founders.It's worth noting that usage of ""other"" currencies also rose, to 15 percent from 10 percent during 2023. The Chinese yuan edged up to a 4 percent share, just pushing into the fourth spot ahead of the Japanese yen, with sterling staying in third place. Change is afoot, though — global payment flows may no longer be comprehensively captured in SWIFT data.Bilateral trade between China and Russia and the rest of the BRICS+ confederation is hard to assess, but the potential for an increase is clearly there. Kit Juckes, chief currency strategist at Societe Generale SA, told me the real story is about fragmentation. He reckons it's becoming much harder to get an accurate reading of the data, but expects over time the disruption from the pandemic and heightened geopolitical woes will lead to less trade occurring in both dollars and euros.The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is also diminishing the euro’s market share, according to Mark Tinker, chief executive officer of ToscaFund Hong Kong Ltd. In his Market Thinking substack blog, Tinker argues that the March 2022 ban on Russia using SWIFT combined with other sanctions prompted Europe to buy liquid natural gas from the US and Qatar in dollars. As the BRICS+ start to use fewer dollars, Europe in turn is being forced to use the US currency more frequently.The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control may have initiated the move to freeze Russia’s foreign reserves, but the EU is tarred with the same brush — even if it’s only planning to tax the profits, rather than seize the assets. Around $200 billion is believed to be held up in European institutions, mostly trapped in the settlement conduit Euroclear.The double whammy of ending European reliance on cheap Russian hydrocarbons — which were paid for solely in euros — and being forced into the dollar energy market illustrates a radical alteration in global trading. Some of this commodity effect will dissipate over time as the move to renewable energy sources continues, but more permanent is the shift in what the EU sells to Russia and China. Many of the luxury and manufacturing products Russia bought from Europe are now being now sourced via China and Hong Kong. It's the worst of all worlds for the euro export machine, though at least the value of the common currency is both stable and roughly in line with its long-term average to the dollar.The China-EU trading relationship is worth $900 billion annually, but it's increasingly skewed against Europe's long-term interests. China is buying less high-value products from the bloc. The German auto sector is ramping up electric-vehicle production to combat a deluge of Chinese cheap EVs, but it has an almighty battle on its hands. Germany at least has the monetary firepower to protect its industries: A €902 million ($983 million) package convinced Swedish EV battery maker Northvolt AB to build a new cell plant in Germany rather than the US.The rest of European manufacturing may need wider help, such as from more joint EU debt, as French President Emmanuel Macron has called for. Hopes for the euro area to introduce a comprehensive fiscal union have dissipated but there is a lot more  remedial action needed, such as addressing perennial budget deficits and subpar growth, before any wholesale political reform such as creating a capital markets union is possible.While the fall in euro usage and corresponding jump in dollar dominance may have been overdone last year, any correction is likely to be modest until the geopolitical air clears. Some of the loss of status and relevance for the euro will be permanent. The dollar's position as global reserve currency is unassailable. Twelve years after Mario Draghi’s pledge to do whatever it takes to safeguard the euro, its existence may be guaranteed but its global role is anything but assured.Marcus Ashworth is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

The smaller indices, however, continued to outperform, with the Mid-cap index gaining 1.3 percent and touching a new high","Dear Reader,Indian markets had a tough extended week, comprising six trading days, battling domestic headwinds even as the US market continued to rise. Though the week started on a strong note, HDFC Bank, the largest private sector bank, announced numbers that were below market expectations. The stock was hammered and being an index heavyweight, it pulled the entire market down with it.  Indian markets ended the week 1.5 percent lower, while the US markets closed 0.7 percent higher.  HDFC Bank has been only an excuse for the fall, as Indian markets have been structurally weak for the last couple of weeks, which may likely continue.  Weakness To Continue Nifty has seen a sharp correction this week and has made a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, which is a bearish reversal pattern. In addition, the index has broken a higher top higher bottom formation on the daily chart by breaking the low of 21448. Friday's upmove should be viewed as a bounce/pullback. On the way up, a rise toward the 21704 – 21850 zone is likely to attract selling pressure, and the Nifty index should eventually break Thursday's low of 21285 in the coming days. The sharp decline during the week pushed the swing lower to 20 levels, an oversold zone. Normally, we see a 2-3 day pullback from oversold conditions. Since the Nifty index has broken the support line, the Nifty index can resume its downward journey in the days to come once the pullback is complete. Source: web.strike.moneyThe FIIs' positioning of index futures has taken a U-turn this week. At the start of the week, they were in a net long position in index futures by 81,695 contracts. However, they are ending the week with a net short position of 22,564 contracts. The FIIs typically take positions in the broader market direction and go from one extreme to another. If this pattern repeats, we can expect the FIIs' short position to reach 1,25,000 contacts to 1,70,000 contracts in the coming weeks, which will act as a headwind for the markets in the near term.Source: web.strike.moneyThe 40-day advance-decline (A/D) ratio nearly touched the second red line on 22nd December 2023. When the ratio hits the second red line, it typically indicates highly overbought conditions. Post 22nd December 2023, the Nifty Index rose higher till mid-January 2024, but the 40-day A/D ratio drifted lower, indicating the breadth is getting narrower. The 40-day A/D ratio has already corrected from a highly overbought condition, but it can go down further as the Nifty index has broken the trendline support.Source: web.strike.moneyIndices and Market BreadthBenchmark indices touched a new all-time high at the start of the week but lost 1.5 percent. Besides HDFC Bank-related selloff, the market was also under pressure because of escalating tension in the Middle East. The smaller indices, however, continued to outperform, with the Mid-cap index gaining 1.3 percent and touching a new high.  The star performers for the week were Oracle Financial Services Software, SJVN, and NHPC, while the losers were Vedant Fashions, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, and Sun TV Network. The Small-cap index touched a new high, though it closed flat for the week. Among sectors, the Private Bank index lost 4 percent, Media stocks were down 3 percent and Realty index was down 2 percent. Among the gainers were the Oil & Gas index, which was up 3.5 percent, and Nifty Bank index rose 3.3 percent. Markets were also under pressure as foreign investors (FIIs) sold equities worth of Rs 22,972.66 crore during the week. Domestic institutional investors were cautious and bought shares worth Rs 10,712.73 crore.Global Market The US market continued its strong run, thanks to a sharp recovery in frontline and banking stocks. Data on record online sales in December also helped improve market sentiment. Statements from Fed officials that interest rates would not be cut earlier led to some market correction.  All major European markets closed the week in the red as economists at the World Economic Forum in Davos pointed out that interest rates are unlikely to come down before summer or 2024.  Except for Japan, most Asian markets closed the week in red. Japanese markets touched a new 34-year high as inflation data showed prices easing. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) fund infusion failed to improve market sentiment in China, which closed the week 4.54 percent lower, while Hong Kong stocks lost 7.74 percent in a week.  Stocks to watch   Among the frontline stocks showing strong momentum on the upside are Tata Motors, TCS, GAIL, REC, Tech Mahindra, Cipla, and Trent. Stocks showing weakness are HDFC Bank, Vinati Organics, Navin Flourine, UPL, and VIP Industries.Cheers,Shishir Asthana "

Now comes the delicate part where actions and communication need to be more nuanced. It's important not to conflate a reluctance to be pushed around by traders as a rejection of cutsbloo","In the rapidly evolving outlook for interest rates, some things are still sacrosanct. The pace of price increases has slowed significantly, and the argument is now how much — rather than when — borrowing costs will be lowered this year. Traders have latched on to the idea that relief will come by March, and some economists even flag a period of below-target inflation. The folks actually making the decisions sound unconvinced, and have fallen back on two lines of defense that can use a rigorous stress test.Despite bets they will capitulate within months, officials cling to a couple of well-worn phrases: the last mile of the inflation fight is the hardest, and the very worst thing would be to declare victory. The assertions are related. They translate to “Don't push us, the spike of 2021 and 2022 remains too raw.” Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, chided traders last week and warned that speculation about cuts is unhelpful to policy deliberations. It's almost as if raising the issue is a punishable offense.Salons in Davos last week were replete with denials that a win is at hand. Nor has the refutation been limited to chattering on the slopes. “Mission is not accomplished yet, but it's on track,” Ravi Menon, who led the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said in one of his last interviews before retiring from the civil service in December. The International Monetary Fundrecently urged officials to stand firm in “the very last mile” of the inflation fight. What did this last mile do to have warranted, in equal measure, such vilification and reverence?A new paper from the Federal Reserve investigated the last-mile theory and found it wanting. David Rapach, an economist at the Atlanta Fed, wrote that the analogy is grounded in a long race where an athlete tires as the end is in sight and needs extra exertions to get there. The finish line is the 2 percent inflation target. The Fed's preferred measure rose 2.6 percent in November from a year earlier, within striking distance.The concern is that the last stretch will require something more. Officials will need to extract an additional cost from the economy in terms of jobs and growth. However, it's not obvious to Rapach that the sporting analogy works. “For the last 1 to 2 percentage points of disinflation to be fundamentally more difficult than the preceding decline in inflation, there must be some sort of structural mechanism that makes the last mile different from the rest,” he argued. “Such mechanisms are not readily apparent in conventional macroeconomic models. Thus, the contention that the last mile of disinflation is more arduous deserves serious scrutiny.”Rapach evaluated the notion that inflation in services, as opposed to goods, is particularly tough to repress.  According to this popular school of thought, getting the cost of manufactured items down is relatively easy. Services, in contrast, are recalcitrant enough to warrant some additional tightening. But “sticky” doesn't mean harder, he wrote. It requires more patience, not necessarily some extra exertion.This isn't some arcane econometric debate. The consequences of misreading the environment are potentially great, not just for the US. While America may have averted a downturn for now, the global expansion isn't in such fine shape. Gross domestic product shrank in Germany last year. There's skepticism that China's economy was healthy enough to have notched the reported 5.2 percent expansion. “From a risk management perspective, believing that the last mile is more strenuous could cause the Fed to tighten policy more than is necessary, which increases the likelihood of a recession and a sharp increase in unemployment,” Rapach concludes.So what's wrong with declaring victory? Perhaps the last mile is hard not because of exhaustion, but ambiguity. This gray area was coming and was always going to be tough. If 2022 was about removing accommodation,2023 was about shifting rates beyond neutral to a region that restrains business and consumers. The task was the same whether you sat around the table at the Fed, the ECB, the Reserve Bank of Australia or the South African Reserve Bank. Even the Bank of Japan let long-term market rates climb. Now comes the delicate part where actions and communication need to be more nuanced. It's important not to conflate a reluctance to be pushed around by traders as a rejection of cuts.Officials probably just need more time to be convinced they won’t have egg on their faces again so soon after the “transitory” fracas. Reductions seem likely. It's just a question of when. Economists at Citigroup Inc. reckon global inflation will retreat to 3.2 percent this year, just slightly above its long-term average of 3 percent, and most major economies are likely to experience slower growth.Capital Economics also suspects the last mile is over-rated and says thereturn of too-low inflation is a growing risk. The current crop of central bankers don't want to go down in history as the second coming of Arthur Burns, the Fed chair in the 1970s often blamed for allowing inflation to escalate. They would rather be Paul Volcker, Neil Shearing, the firm's group chief economist told The Weekly Briefing podcast. But even Volcker started lowering rates in the early 1980s while inflation was still pretty high,because he was convinced it had been broken. And the economic cost was high; the 1981-82 recession was one of the deepest on record.Maybe they should just be themselves. I ran two half-marathons last year and would have competed in a third in December, were it not for a nasty knee injury. My coach was constantly telling me the struggles in the latter stages of such events are more mental, less physical. Block out how you feel and just know you will get to the finish line. One foot in front of the other.One inflation reading at a time. Not that arduous after all.Daniel Moss is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg "

It was only 6 million tonnes below the pre-pandemic trend for 2015-2019 last year.India and China both experienced compound annual growth in consumption of around 3.5% between 2012 and 2022, compared with just 0.5% per year in the rest of the world.China's consumption started the 2010s almost three times larger than India's, so similar percentage growth rates have translated into much larger absolute increases in the number of tonnes used.As China's rapid deployment of electric vehicles curbs further consumption growth, India's absolute increases will draw level and then take the lead later this decade.India's share of global oil consumption already rose to more than 5% in 2022, up from 4% in 2021 and 3% in 2002.By 2030, India's crude oil imports and fuel consumption will command almost as much attention from analysts as China's did a decade ago.India's petroleum consumption increased by more than 5% last year, above the average for the previous decade.But rapid growth in the first nine months of the year faded during the fourth quarter, which is one reason why oil prices slumped towards the end of 2023.India's impact on the oil market last year is a foretaste of the much bigger effect it will have before the current decade is over."

But with construction falling short of this target year after year, another question needs to be asked: How was this number arrived at?","Britain’s two main political parties don’t agree on much, but they agree on how to tackle the country’s housing crisis: Build 300,000 homes a year. The ruling Conservative Party adopted this target in 2017, downgrading it to an advisory goal in late 2022 after construction repeatedly fell short. The opposition Labour Party, which is favoured to win a general election likely to be held this year, says it too will aim for the same objective. For a number that has inspired such widespread acceptance, it has a curiously murky provenance.Where does it come from? No one seems entirely sure, including Parliament itself. “The 300,000 figure is not universally accepted as the ‘right’ number of homes to aim for,” a House of Commons research briefing said in May, noting that both the public accounts committee and the housing, communities and local government committee had highlighted “the lack of information on the government’s basis for settling on this figure.”The origin of the number isn’t an idle query. Some analysts question whether the UK has a shortage at all, arguing this is an affordability crisis that can be only marginally affected by increasing supply. So knowing the rationale behind such estimates is useful to understanding how policymakers should approach one of the country’s biggest economic challenges.The genesis of the target can be traced to a 2013 report by economist Alan Holmans, who estimated a need for 240,000 to 245,000 homes a year in England through 2031. That number then appears to have been rounded up by government ministers, according to Ian Mulheirn, former chief economist at the London-based Tony Blair Institute and a housing-shortage sceptic. Whether the upward revision was an attempt to compensate for exceptionally low levels of construction in the mid-2010s or simply because politicians (like journalists) are drawn to big round numbers isn’t clear. Either way, 300,000 entered the parliamentary echo chamber and became part of the received wisdom.Mulheirn calls the 300,000 figure “entirely arbitrary” and says it is about twice what’s indicated by the growth in households. While the Holmans study was authoritative, the demographic projections underpinning his estimate turned out to be more benign in practice. For example, the government repeatedly predicted average household size would keep falling, as it had in the 1980s and 1990s. Smaller households imply a need for more homes. In the event, the trend flattened.At its most basic, the calculation is simple. Divide population by average household size and you have an idea of the number that need homes. Using Office for National Statistics projections, England’s population in 2035 is expected to be 59.2 million with an average household size of 2.28, compared with 56.6 million and 2.36 in 2020. That equates to 26 million households, up from 24 million. Divide the 2 million growth by 15 and the back of the envelope says we need to build about 135,000 extra houses a year.From these straightforward beginnings, everything sinks into a morass of statistical and philosophical incertitude. For one thing, projections can turn out to be wrong. Just as critically, there is a question of causality. Does average household size determine the number of homes needed, or does the availability of supply determine household size? It’s easy to see how the latter can apply, as in the case of adult children who continue living with their parents because they can’t afford to move out. These variables influence each other. Then, there is the question of how we define need. For example, a family living in a rented apartment with damp walls is housed but still clearly in need.Other economists using different methodologies have arrived at far higher estimates of housing need. In a 2018 report, Glen Bramley, a professor at Heriot-Watt University, estimated a backlog of 4.75 million households across Britain requiring help and recommended building 380,000 homes annually for 15 years. There has been “systematic undersupply relative to manifest and latent demand over a long period, particularly in London and the South of England,” Bramley, who has advised UK governments on housing policy for decades, told me.The argument that building more won’t do much to improve affordability is compelling. Because housing is an investment asset as well as a consumption good, rental returns and the cost of capital tend to be more important in determining prices than supply. UK home prices have risen from less than four times average earnings in the late 1990s to more than eight times, but this happened in tandem with a global property boom driven by declining interest rates. Critics of the 300,000 target point out that prices can surge even as supply expands, as in countries such as Spain and Ireland prior to the global financial crisis (when both suffered painful housing busts).But trying to influence the market isn’t the only reason to build. Bramley’s more expansive definition includes multifamily households, those living in overcrowded, temporary or poor conditions and people who are defined as living in poverty by the UK standard after paying their housing costs. This approach feels closer to the reality that many of us would recognise. No one living in London is far away from tales or personal experience of the hardship caused by the capital’s property squeeze, while events such as the Grenfell Tower fire and the death of a child from the effects of mold attest to the inadequacy of much of the existing social housing stock. Those priced out of the private market still need to live somewhere, and inadequate shelter takes a toll on health and is a drag on economic productivity.Perhaps it’s better not to fixate on a single number. Whatever the true figure, Britain needs to build more.Matthew Brooker is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg"

New Hampshire is her last chance to slow the MAGA train before it heads south to Fortress Dixie","The US-Mexico border is a contentious issue as New Hampshire Republicans go to the polls Tuesday to choose a Republican nominee for president. The state’s border with Massachusetts may be an even more pressing issue.Indeed, when former Republican US Senator Kelly Ayotte announced her campaign for governor in July, she cast the stakes of the 2024 election in most dire terms. ""We are one election away from becoming Massachusetts in New Hampshire,” Ayotte said.  In her version of border-war politics, the northern Massachusetts cities of Lowell and Lawrence play the role of Juarez and Tijuana, flooding New Hampshire with fentanyl smuggled across the state line.  New Hampshire even has a local variant on the “Great Replacement,” the conspiracy theory that casts demographic change as a Democratic plot to obliterate White Americans. Except in New Hampshire, where nine of 10 residents are (still) non-Hispanic White, the invasion is more about space than race.Median mortgage costs in New Hampshire are about $300 cheaper than in Massachusetts. For years, desperados from Massachusetts have been crossing the border for bigger houses and lower taxes. According to Brookings Institution demographer William Frey, fully one-quarter of New Hampshire’s current population was born in Massachusetts.A  report  released last week by University of New Hampshire political scientists documented how recent population churn has shaped the potential electorate:In the past four years, the state gained 245,000 potential new voters, between newcomers moving to the state and young people reaching voting age. In the same period, 208,000 longtime residents left the state or died. As a result, 22 percent of potential Granite State voters next week were either too young to vote (6 percent) or did not reside in New Hampshire (16 percent) in 2020The Covid pandemic accelerated longer trends. Nashua, the second-largest city in New Hampshire, is fewer than 50 miles from Boston. Work-from-home employees with incomes tied to Greater Boston will be part of Tuesday’s primary electorate, though it’s impossible to know to what extent.Thus, the real import of Ayotte’s warning: Too much Massachusetts could be bad for Republicans. That’s likely what former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is quietly hoping — at least regarding a certain type of Republican. After a dismal loss to Donald Trump in Iowa, Haley is hoping to benefit from a more moderate electorate and the prospect of independent voters participating in the GOP primary. New Hampshire is her last chance to slow the MAGA train before it heads south to Fortress Dixie.Trump has a double-digit lead over Haley in New Hampshire in FiveThirtyEight’s  polling average . She needs a strong showing from new voters and old-time anti-MAGA voters to close that gap. About one-quarter of votes in the 2016 GOP primary went to candidates John Kasich, Chris Christie or Carly Fiorina. Trump won the state with 35 percent.Of course, many of those once-moderate voters have likely capitulated to the authoritarian movement that now dominates the party. Many recent migrants from Massachusetts are no doubt conservatives themselves. (As political scientists Hans Noel and Daniel Hopkins noted in a 2022 study , “conservative” is increasingly a signifier for “Trumpy.”) Trump received more than one million votes in Massachusetts in 2020 while losing the state to Joe Biden, and some of the New Hampshire towns nearest the Massachusetts border, University of New Hampshire political scientist Dante Scala pointed out to me, are MAGA strongholds.Massachusetts has loomed large in the GOP imagination ever since the state became identified with brainy liberalism. Ayotte’s Massachusetts warning is a staple of her campaign message and the first sentence in her November essay in the Union Leader. “I’m running for governor because I am worried that New Hampshire is one election away from becoming Massachusetts — from becoming something we are not,” she wrote.There are worse fates than turning into Massachusetts. Median household income in Massachusetts is about $5,700 higher than in New Hampshire. While New Hampshire has high-ranked public schools, Massachusetts schools typically lead the nation. Massachusetts also leads in the percentage of residents who have health insurance—almost 98 percent —thanks to Obamacare and state efforts.New Hampshire, with its quality public schools and low levels of gun violence, has far more in common with its New England neighbours than with the red states that define and dominate the Republican Party. For Haley to have a chance on Tuesday, a subtler, less Trumpy, shade of red will have to assert itself. If she somehow, someway, pulls an upset, MAGA will know just who to blame: Massachusetts. Francis Wilkinson is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

In an interview with Bloomberg Television last week, Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth lauded the company’s nearly 150-year long history in the Golden State, adding: “We are the only large oil company left in California.”  Which begs the question: why stay?The paths of Chevron and California are diverging inexorably. The state, led by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, is hostile to the fossil-fuel industry, despite voracious consumption of petroleum products there. Worse, the oil company’s bosses have become a convenient scapegoat for local politicians seeking to burnish their credentials with voters. It’s not just a political distraction; it’s also hurting the bottom line.Earlier this month, Chevron announced it would write down the value of its oil production assets in California by several billion dollars “due to continuing regulatory challenges.” At the same time, the firm is fighting California regulators over the so-called margin penalty law. Those rules allow the state to set the maximum profit refiners can make processing crude oil into gasoline because... well, it seems the laws of supply, demand and prices don’t apply to the oil industry; capitalism is for everyone, bar fossil-fuel firms.Chevron is transfixed by a sentimental yearning for the happiness of a former era. The petroleum giant has been in California since 1876, when its earliest processor, the California Star Oil Works, struck oil in the Santa Susana mountains north of Los Angeles. Soon after, it built an oil refinery in the San Francisco Bay Area, which it still operates, and turned the city into its corporate base. But times have changed.Unsurprisingly, Chevron plans to spend far less money in California than it did in the past because, Wirth explained, those “investments are less and less attractive.” Still, the company remains loyal to its California roots as the location of its headquarters. But Chevron and its executives need to put sentimentality aside. It’s time to pack up and relocate. The move would deliver two benefits: It makes business sense, and it would send a strong message. True, corporate relocations are relatively rare – many companies stay loyal to where they were founded, weathering the ups and downs of their hometowns.  But they do happen, and the oil industry itself provides numerous examples. Exxon Mobil Corp. has moved twice since 1990, first to a suburb of Dallas from New York City, and from there to the outskirts of Houston last year. Shell Plc relocated its global headquarters to London from the Dutch city of The Hague in early 2022.Chevron itself has moved, too, although by fewer than 50 miles. Two decades ago, it closed its downtown headquarters in San Francisco, a staple of the city at 575 Market Street, and moved into a business park in San Ramon, about 45 minutes away by car. Last year, it sold that location, and downsized into another nearby business park, which it currently leases. Today, about 1,800 people work at its San Ramon headquarters, including the CEO and chief financial officer.Last year’s mini-relocation would have provided a great opportunity to move further away. Chevron decided against it, although it shifted more employees to Houston and exchanged outright ownership of its head offices for a leasehold. Today, the company employs more people in the Houston area than in the San Francisco region.In selecting where to seat their corporate headquarters, companies should aim to tick three boxes: Attract a young and motivated workforce interested in the business, be close to their main operations; and establish a base somewhere that aligns with their values. For an oil company, California doesn’t tick any of those boxes. Texas certainly does, and maybe Colorado too. Chevron, in particular, is giving away the benefits that come with “agglomeration economies” — the geographic clustering of industries. That’s even most important as the American petroleum industry enjoys a renaissance, with Houston as its capital.An argument for staying put Chevron’s existing significant business in California, particularly in refining. By keeping the state as its home, the company may hope to have a stronger influence than if it leaves. However, if the last decade is any guide, Chevron’s political influence there is rather limited, as is its financial clout. California’s large public pension funds have reduced their exposure to the company significantly. Today, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System own about 7 million shares, or less than 0.4 percent of the total, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A decade ago, they controlled 17 million shares. Perhaps also there’s a future in California for some of Chevron’s nascent new energy business lines. But for the stuff that Chevron is truly interested in — say, carbon sequestration or hydrogen — Texas is a better base.When the Wharton business school looked in 2017 at why companies relocated, it found that sometimes it was a personal choice: The CEO wanted to live elsewhere, or the company wanted to attract a new boss who didn’t want to relocate. So perhaps Chevron is sticking with California because Houston isn’t San Ramon — in which case, Austin beckons as a way to move to Texas without abandoning all of the benefits of living in a hipster community. Either way, money should go to where it’s welcomed and stay where it’s well treated — neither of which is currently true of petrodollars and California.Javier Blas is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Shares of large finished-dosage drug manufacturers Cipla, Sun Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories gained 1-7 percent in Tuesday trade, outperforming the broader markets.Cipla’s results indicate a benign US drug market. Revenues in the North America market grew 18 percent in dollar terms, helped by traction in better-priced limited competition drugs, respiratory products and the base generic drugs business.Respiratory products generally see elevated demand during the December quarter and strong sales at Cipla indicate a favourable flu season this year. Moreover, a steady base generic drug business implies a stable pricing environment.The trends will likely help Sun Pharma, Lupin and Dr Reddy’s Labs report decent US sales. They have large exposure to the US drug market. Among them, Lupin is projected to see notable contribution from flu season products.As for Cipla, the company did well in India also. Revenues in India are up 12 percent, supported by growth in branded prescription and trade generic drugs. Branded prescription drugs, which constitute a large portion of the India business, is outpacing market growth. The performance is notably better than the India pharmaceutical market growth which saw patchy recovery in the December quarter.Higher sales and lower costs drove Cipla’s profit margins to the highest levels in recent years. “EBITDA margin for 9M FY24 is at 25.4 percent. This compares to management’s guidance of 23-24 percent for EBITDA margin in FY24,” point out analysts at Nomura.The performance of other drugmakers can vary in the domestic market due to their varied product mix -- Cipla has greater exposure to respiratory products. But a combination of steady US sales and soft input costs should aid profit margins of other finished dosage drug manufacturers as well.That said, as companies enter the final quarter of FY24, investor focus will turn to FY25 and the products that are likely to drive growth in the coming year. A couple of products that Cipla is working on risk facing delays in launches and commercialisation in the US.In its latest update, Cipla said it has filed two inhaler products with the US drug regulator and plans to launch four peptide products in FY25. Timely launch of the new products and traction in the US business will play an important role in stock returns.Investing insights from our research teamMC Pro’s Budget 2023 portfolio delivers 53 percent returns in 1 year, outperforming benchmarks by a wide marginZEEL: What does it mean for the stock as the merger with Sony falls apart?Should investors bet on the Paytm stock as losses narrow in Q3?Persistent Systems Q3 FY24 – Industry-leading performance at a steep valuationMetro Brands Limited: Strong earnings growth to resume from FY25Colgate Palmolive: Investment in brands paying offTrackerPro Economic Tracker | Power consumption hits 11-week high, consumer sentiments varyWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Oracle punters piggyback on Tortoise fund, HDFC Bank loyalist perseveres, operators go loco on IRCTCNiti Aayog’s claim of a steep fall in poverty doesn’t pass the smell testBudget Snapshot: Defence capex sees renewed thrustWhat makes the Ram Temple project a marketing masterclass?Badla financiers are very much alive and flourishingCan Ayodhya impact the Lok Sabha election in the South?Budget 2024: Scope to unlock tourism potentialIDFC First Bank’s 5-year plan needs an opex fixThe Eastern Window: The Middle-East is now a powder keg waiting to explodeGrumblers about passive investing may have a point (republished from the FT)Sony puts India’s advertisers in a tight spotRam Mandir: Nine key messages from PM Modi’s speechChinese EV shipping deals are either savvy or very riskyDon’t confuse Netanyahu’s interests with Israel’sUnion Budget 2024: Big ticket science needs big moneyPersonal FinanceChildren settled abroad?

But that is where the story needs a third chapter.""…in line with the improvement in its financial position, the listed (corporate) sector has increased its capex substantially in the past two years,"" said Nikhil Gupta, chief economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.""Conversely, mirroring its weaker financial condition, the unlisted sector – which is almost three times larger than that of the listed sector – has experienced a considerable deceleration in capex. This discrepancy is one of the key factors contributing to the declining trend corporate investments across India,"" Gupta added.In many ways, the private capex cycle is well-primed to do well, with the authorities repeatedly pointing at the fact that the balance sheets of the banking and corporate sector are finally clean and healthy. However, capacity utilisation – at least in the manufacturing sector – remains below the crucial 75 percent level, according to a Reserve Bank of India survey.On the whole, India's gross fixed capital formation – a proxy for investments – is estimated to grow by 10.3 percent in the current fiscal year after an 11.4 percent increase in the previous year, according to the statistics ministry. However, private capex remains far from broad-based. Will that change in 2024-25?"

Crude prices fell from $80 per barrel due to subdued demand, then rose to $90 with OPEC+ supply cuts and Middle-East tensions, but ended the year below $80 due to oil oversupply.","As the Indian energy sector goes greener, it seeks higher budgetary support from the government, with renewed emphasis on cleaner fuels such as green hydrogen and natural gas.The oil and gas industry is keenly anticipating reforms, particularly in city gas distribution (CGD), to bolster natural gas consumption. Simultaneously, the power sector hopes for measures that will further incentivise the adoption of renewable energy sources.In 2023, the oil and gas sector faced volatility in international crude oil prices because of the raging geopolitical tensions, supply cuts, and escalating demand concerns. Crude prices fell from $80 a barrel because of subdued demand, and then rose to $90 when the oil cartel OPEC+ lowered supplies and Middle-East tension flared up, but ended the year below $80 due amid oversupply.India reached an all-time high peak power demand of 240 GW in September 2023, surpassing the ministry's predicted peak demand of 230 GW. The power ministry emphasised the need to add 80 GW of thermal coal-based power generation capacity in 2023, a significant increase from the current 27 GW under construction.India has committed to achieving 500 GW of renewable energy (RE) capacity by 2030 as part of its Paris accord commitment. Progress has been notable, surpassing 170 GW in 2023. However, there is a need for additional efforts to accelerate the growth trajectory.What to expect from the BudgetThe oil and gas sector anticipates the finance minister to allocate expenses towards enhancing the green and sustainable energy sector. Oil PSUs are actively pursuing net-zero targets and investing significantly in renewable energy sources. In the previous budget, Sitharaman had allocated Rs 30,000 crore for capital investments in the energy transition for state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs), but the funds have not been allocated to OMCs yet.Analysts further anticipate increased capital expenditure for renewable energy and measures to enhance hydrogen competitiveness, leading to more job opportunities and diversification within the solar and wind energy sectors. Budget plans are expected to promote indigenous development, facilitate technology transfer, and incentivise local manufacturing initiatives to conserve foreign exchange. Key expectations include proactive measures in incentives to boost manufacturing and R&D hubs, along with a reduction in GST rates.According to CareEdge, the renewable energy sector seeks financial support for offshore wind projects. The firms in this sector also eye lesser basic customs duty on solar cells, and seek reduced duties on electrolysers and battery components. The thermal energy sector calls for increased investments in rail infrastructure and operationalisation of commercial mines.Stocks to watchRenewable energy stocks experienced a stellar performance in 2023, delivering returns ranging from 100-270 percent. Companies like REC, PFC, and Waaree Renewables achieved over 250 percent returns, while Gensol registered a 100 percent return during the year.Stocks of Adani Green Energy, SJVN, NHPC, Suzlon Energy Ltd, Tata Power Co Ltd, Gensol Power, Adani Power, KPI Green Energy, JSW Energy and Inox Wind are expected to be in focus leading up to the budget.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Here, we examine the status of the manufacturing sector, which has been a key focus area of the government as part of its objective to make India self-sufficient.","It would be an understatement to say that the government wants the manufacturing sector to do well, with the flagship Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme expanding nearly every year. This, the government hopes, will pave the way for more investments and job opportunities.As of November 2023, the PLI schemes have attracted more than Rs 1 lakh crore of investment, recorded sales of Rs 8.61 lakh crore, and directly and indirectly created over 6.78 lakh jobs, according to the government.Also read: Raghuram Rajan and Rohit Lamba – the full interview""Manufacturing of various electronic components like battery, chargers, PCBA (printed circuit board assembly), PCB (printed circuit board), camera modules, passive components, and certain mechanics have been localised in the country,"" the government said in a statement on January 17.But critics see the attention on manufacturing as being oversized. ""The problem with this vision is that the world has sort of moved on… This notion that the old, export-led growth in manufacturing is going to be available to us just like it was available to everybody else fails to recognise the reality,"" former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan told Moneycontrol in an interview in December.Whatever the case may be, the government is not going to back down and is hoping the sector becomes a cause for envy for the developed world. While certain segments are chugging along nicely, some are not. Take, for instance, consumer goods.In November 2023, production of consumer durable and non-durable goods was down 5.4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, over the last year. In the April-November period, output of non-durables has been up 5.6 percent, and that of durable goods a mere 0.6 percent.Other indicators of manufacturing performance suggest the sector is faring rather well. The Purchasing Managers' Index has been above 50, which separates expansion in activity from contraction, for 30 months in a row. Further, the GDP data shows the sector is set to expand by 6.5 percent in 2023-24 – five times faster than the growth rate of 1.3 percent in FY23.Maybe, Indian manufacturing just needs more time?"

This is the highest level of asset formation in the Indian economy since 2009.As per economists, India has to maintain GFCF above 32 percent of GDP on a sustained basis to achieve higher growth and unleash the animal spirits of the economy.The uptick in GFCF has been made possible by sustained high allocation towards capital expenditure by the government as well as a pick-up in private sector capex.The previous Budget hiked the capital investment outlay by 33 percent to a record Rs 10 lakh crore. The capex figure in the Interim Budget 2024-25 will be keenly watched."

India's electric vehicle market is expected to grow to 1 crore units in annual sales by 2030 and create five crore direct and indirect jobs, according to the Economic Survey 2022-23.As per industry estimates, the total EV sales in India stood at around 10 lakh units in 2022. On the back of increasing EV demand, the Indian government is providing fiscal incentives to promote domestic manufacturing of these cars.The government has rolled out PLI schemes for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery storage with an outlay of Rs 18,100 crore and Rs 26,058 crore PLI scheme for auto, auto-components and drone industries.In India, Tata Motors is the leading player in passenger electric vehicles.Describing his participation in the WEF as a ""highly successful"" one, the secretary said India has consistently fostered an environment of trust and confidence among investors and stakeholders.""This impactful presence at the World Economic Forum 2024 solidifies India's commitment to establishing itself as a reliable and influential player on the global stage,"" he added."

It’s also broken,"January 22, 2024 09:10 AM IST","A study of IPOs since 2004 over a ten-year trading cycle reveal that they yielded negative returns for investors. Though it’s the regulator’s job to ensure that companies with reasonably solid prospects come to public markets and offer stock at a price that allows long-term wealth creation, SEBI's measures have proven too contentious","India is one of the world’s busiest markets for initial public offerings. It has had more companies debuting over the past year than China and Japan, combined. But if history is any guide, in the long run, most of them will turn out to be duds.Yet, such is the attraction of the “pop” — large listing-day returns — that this fever won’t abate.Something is badly broken. YK2 Partners, a boutique firm that invests only in Indian public markets, has done the math for two decades of initial fundraising by the country’s firms. Analysts at Mumbai- and London-based YK2 considered all the 300-plus mainboard issuances since January 2004 with a 10-year trading history. The average IPO in this set has returned -3.5 percent a year, according to their calculations, turning a 100-rupee ($1.2) investment into 70 rupees a decade later.It doesn’t matter whether they listed in 2004 or 2013, or any year in between. Indian IPOs have failed miserably at generating additional returns for investors over what they would have earned passively from just owning a broad benchmark. About 77 percent have underperformed the NSE500 Index over a 10-year period, with average underperformance of more than 14 percent annually. In other words, the 100 rupees not invested in debutants could have, with very little effort, become 280 rupees.“We cynically characterise the IPO process as a scheme orchestrated by management, private equity investors, anchor investors, investment bankers, media, etc.,” YK2’s co-founders Arun Agarwal and Vinod Nair, wrote in a note accompanying their research. “It might make sense for investors looking for an IPO pop but not for long term investors like us.”It’s the regulator’s job to ensure that companies with reasonably solid prospects come to public markets and offer stock at a price that allows long-term wealth creation. That the local IPO market is falling far short of this ideal is something the Securities and Exchange Board of India has been aware for a long time. Yet, some of the steps that the SEBI has attempted or contemplated proved too contentious.One of them was grading of IPOs (similar to credit rating for bonds). Made mandatory from 2007, grading became optional in 2014 amid intense lobbying. Another idea was to let retail investors return stock to the controlling shareholders at the issue price after three months of significant underperformance. This safety net was considered for years and then dropped.But it should still be possible to improve the quality of the primary capital market. Clearly, the current disclosures-based pricing regime is not up to dealing with the challenge. Just a couple of months ago, Madhabi Puri Buch, the SEBI chair, said that often the justification supplied by companies for high IPO valuations was “nothing but some meaningless English words.”There may be a simple reason why verbiage can so easily masquerade as value: The average IPO delivers an average 25 percent listing-day gain, and India’s rich have a savings glut. Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, has in the past held a “global savings glut” — a pool of capital flowing out of China and oil-producing nations — responsible for low interest rates. In India’s case, it’s capital controls that put a limit on how much the affluent class can invest overseas. Any excess of local savings ends up chasing domestic assets, from real estate to IPOs.Property transactions have some inertia built into them, but punts on IPOs are very quickly flipped. That explains the average oversubscription of 44 times in recent years. So how to throw some sand into the wheel? The SEBI chief said Friday that the regulator is investigating investment banks that artificially inflate share applications to create a false impression of demand.Cleaning up the market is a good first step, but it won’t be enough. YK2’s Agarwal suggests that the SEBI should consider a mandatory lock-in period of one year for all IPO investors so that subscription is driven by fundamentals and not the lure of a pop. More disclosures will be just more words. They can’t break this nexus of unusual demand and opportunistic supply. Only more skin in the game can.Andy Mukherjee is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Post COVID-19, the Budget has been laying special emphasis on capex. It has kick-started a dormant cycle for the economy.As a result India has witnessed over 7 per cent growth in the last three years, the highest among the large economies of the world.During the current financial year, the government has made a record high provision of Rs 10 lakh crore towards capex. During 2020-21, the government earmarked Rs 4.39 lakh crore which increased by 35 per cent to Rs 5.54 lakh crore in the subsequent year.Another 35 per cent hike in capex was done in 2022-23 to Rs 7.5 lakh crore which subsequently reached a high of Rs 10 lakh crore, an increase of 37.4 per cent. In the upcoming Budget too, the government is expected to earmark a large amount towards capex as such investment has a multiplier effect on the economy and it also crowds in private investment.”We estimate Government of India to budget for a capex of Rs 10.2 lakh crore in FY25, implying a relatively sedate YoY expansion of about 10 per cent, compared to over 20 per cent expansion seen in each of post-COVID years. The slowdown in capex growth is likely to have some bearing on economic activity and GDP growth,” Icra said in its pre-Budget expectations.The capex rose by 31 per cent to Rs 5.9 lakh crore in April-November of the current fiscal (58.5 per cent of FY2024 BE) from Rs 4.5 lakh in April-November FY23 (60.7 per cent of FY23 Prov).While the growth remained high, capital spending contracted in October 2023 (-14.9 per cent; first instance of contraction since April 2023) and then rose by a marginal 1.6 per cent in November 2023. Moreover, it has averaged at Rs 73,210 crore/month, 12.2 per cent lower than the required monthly average of Rs 83,400 crore to meet the budgeted target of Rs 10 lakh crore. India is a hugely infra deficit country and heavy lifting in this regard is being done by the government which crowds in private investment.With the growth in the economy, there has been a pick-up in private investment in recent times in some of the sectors like steel, cement and petroleum sector. According to Emkay Global Financial Services head research Seshadri Sen, capex by the government would continue and it will happen at a faster pace.The capex would help unlock the virtuous cycle. Investment leading to productivity growth, job creation, demand and exports feed into each other and enable animal spirits in the economy to thrive."

Here, we examine the status of the agricultural sector, which has suffered, despite the government's efforts, due to vagaries of the weather.","The agriculture sector stood strong during the coronavirus pandemic, growing by 5.1 percent on average in 2019-20 and 2020-21. If not for the farm sector, the economy would have contracted by far more than the average 1 percent in each of the two aforementioned years.However, it has been a tough 2023-24 for farmers, with the statistics ministry estimating that the sector's growth rate this year is set to be at an eight-year low of 1.8 percent.Also Read: Direct cash transfers a hit but farm infrastructure still a miss""Exacerbating the anticipated downside in 2023 Kharif production, Rabi sowing has lost pace in recent weeks with area sown under pulses lagging by 5.1 percent. In addition, El Nino as a global phenomenon continuing into 2024 could spell some downside for the Rabi crop in the face of warmer temperatures over January-March 2024 and April-June 2024,"" economists from QuantEco Research said.""Having said so, anticipated end to El Nino in 2024-25 and high possibility of normal Southwest monsoon in 2024 should prove supportive for agriculture output,"" they added.Solid growth of the agricultural sector is crucial for the Indian economy. The sector accounts for around 15 percent of the Indian economy and an even larger percentage of workers. Poor production or can also fuel food inflation, as India witnessed in mid-2023. As such, both rural and urban India are heavily dependent on how the farm sector holds up.While major announcements are usually not expected in an interim budget, it would not be surprising to see the farming community being the focus ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Speculation is already rife that the central government is considering raising its annual cash transfer under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme to Rs 8,000 from Rs 6,000.But what the agriculture sector really needs is long-term vision.""The vulnerability of the economy to recurring vegetable price shocks, especially ahead of and during the monsoon, warrants major reforms in perishable supply chains,"" economists from the Reserve Bank of India said in August 2023. With climate-related events impacting agricultural output severely, it would be a surprise if the upcoming budget does not act on this front."

Here, we examine developments in the government's tax revenues and how key links may be breaking down – for the better.","For the third year in row, the government's gross tax collections are set to post double-digit growth rate in 2023-24. More importantly, the rise in tax mop-up so far this year has been more than expected.The Budget for 2023-24 had estimated that gross tax collections would amount to Rs 33.61 lakh crore this year, 10.4 percent higher than the revised estimate for 2022-23. But as per latest data, the tax collected in the first eight months of the year has been nearly 15 percent more than what the finance ministry had managed to mop up in April-November 2022.Also Read: GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicatedTo get a sense of how the final numbers could turn out to be, one can just look at 2022-23. The finance ministry started with a gross tax collection budget estimate of Rs 27.58 lakh crore. On February 1, 2023, this estimate was revised up by 10.3 percent to Rs 30.43 lakh crore. Finally, the actual tax collected, according to the Controller General of Accounts, was nearly half a percent higher at Rs 30.54 lakh crore.After years of overestimating its expected tax numbers, the Budget in recent years has turned tack and been a bit conservative. This has helped make the budget numbers more reliable and not forced ministries to cut expenditure heavily towards the end of the year in a last-minute reverse trolley dash to meet the fiscal deficit target.So, what comes next? Considering the 2024-25 budget is only an interim one, economists and tax experts don't expect any major changes to be announced. According to ratings agency ICRA, gross tax revenues for next year may be pegged at Rs 38 lakh crore – 13.1 percent higher from the budget estimate for 2023-24 but up 11.1 percent from what ICRA thinks the revised estimate for the current year will be.""The estimated growth in GTR (gross tax revenues) for 2024-25 is mildly higher than our nominal GDP growth forecast of 9.5 percent for that fiscal, implying a tax buoyancy of 1.2,"" ICRA economists said."

Here, we examine the position of India's foreign exchange reserves and what the next financial year likely has in store for the authorities.","After a difficult 2022-23, which saw the rupee depreciate and hit new lows against the US dollar, the currency stabilised in 2023-24 and allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to replenish its foreign exchange reserves. In fact, as on January 12, the Indian central bank's forex reserves stood at $619 billion as against $578 billion at the end of 2022-23 and $607 billion a year before that.That India's forex reserves are only $20 billion or so away from their all-time highs speaks volumes given that global geopolitical risks have not receded over the last one year; in fact, they have only increased.Also Read: A decade in the making, India's global bond index inclusion journey finally endsBut what has stood out in 2023-24 is India's robust growth performance. And the external position, despite the monthly merchandise trade deficit hitting record highs during the year, is set to get stronger thanks to the addition of Indian government bonds in global indices. In September 2023, JPMorgan announced India's inclusion in its Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) global index suite with effect from June 2024. According to economists, this could result in foreign inflows of $20-25 billion over a 10-month period.It didn't end there. On January 9, Bloomberg Index Services proposed the inclusion of Indian sovereign debt in its indices starting September 2024.""Given India's inclusion in global bond index, we expect capital flows to be in excess of the CAD (current account deficit) financing requirement, resulting in a Balance of Payments (BoP) surplus in 2024-25,"" said Kaushik Das, Deutsche Bank's chief economist for India & South Asia.""However, net FDI flows have reduced sharply, and this could pose a problem for the BoP, in case volatile FII inflows were to disappoint at any point of time,"" Das added.Trade flows must also be considered, with the world economy expected to slow down further next year. This could hurt India's exports and widen the trade deficit. However, the government has been working on diversifying its export destinations and import sources so that the country can better weather global uncertainty. All in all, India's external buffers – already seen as a key strength – may only get stronger."

Here’s what Bank of America’s survey of global fund managers for January 2024 had to say: global growth expectations among investors are at a 12-month high; 79 percent of investors expect the global economy to have either a ""soft landing"" or no landing this year —a 9-month high; percentage of investors expecting a global recession at a 19-month low and profit expectations at a two-year high.As for the Indian market, the RBI Bulletin’s State of the Economy report said, “Indian markets currently hover around life-time highs with relatively high valuations in comparison with its peers. While this reflects expectations of strong growth in the overall economy, healthy corporate earnings will be key to sustaining these levels.”Another way of putting it is that any disappointment with corporate results is likely to be brutally dealt with by investors, as was seen this week in the HDFC Bank and LTI Mindtree stocks.Our analysis of the LTI Mindtree result is here.We pointed to the problem with HDFC Bank’s margins here, we said deposit growth holds the key to the stock’s re-rating, while our columnist Latha Venkatesh said it’s tough for the bank to reclaim its past glory and my colleague Shishir Asthana listed the follies of analysts and managements in managing investor expectations. The point, though, as this analysis tells us, is that the merger is a near-term hit, does not permanently affect HDFC’s earnings potential, and it’s trading at the low end of its valuation band.It's no wonder then that our columnist Ananya Roy said the market’s jitters point to something deeper and she said the markets are still pricing in significantly steeper rate cuts in 2024 than the Fed, leaving room for disappointment.It's not just monetary policy that is a risk.The markets are pricing in a soft landing for the global economy, a pivot on rate cuts and a halt to quantitative tightening by central banks, no impact of geopolitical tensions on the economy and markets, no impact of the turn towards protectionism, de-globalisation and the reconfiguring of supply chains, no impact of climate change on the economy and markets, no impact of the slowdown in China and no impact of the massive overhang of debt.That’s how high expectations are in this market. It’s no wonder then that it’s difficult to keep up that relentless optimism and the mask of confidence slips from time to time.While India as a resilient haven story is priced in, there are some concerns.For instance, private consumption growth in FY24 has been projected by the National Statistics Office to slip to 4.44 percent, the lowest in many years, excluding the pandemic period. We asked whether it’s time for the government to give a push to consumption in the Interim Budget, given the dismal state of consumption as shown by the Index of Industrial Production data.Shouldn’t the tepid growth in consumption be reflected in the valuations of consumer goods companies? Maybe not. A recent Goldman Sachs report said that Affluent India — those with incomes of $10,000 or more a year — is 60 million strong and will reach 100 million by 2027.Shouldn’t that be enough to ensure consumption growth? To be sure, as the article brilliantly titled India: Marketer’s dream or Piketty’s nightmare, points out, 80 crore Indians are still dependent on the government’s free food scheme and inequality is glaring. But if the economy can grow by more than 7 percent with overall consumption growth so low, the question then is: is the poorer half of the population just a sea of surplus humanity, whose function is to keep wages down and does their consumption really matter?Also, we shouldn’t forget that India’s growth has been the result of a shift from consumption to capex. The RBI Bulletin’s State of the Economy report said, “The upside surprise in the NSO’s estimate is underpinned by a shift from consumption to investment, with the government’s thrust on capex starting to crowd-in private investment as high corporate profitability quarter after quarter has begun to induce the creation of fixed assets.”Note that the NSO advance estimates of GDP for 2023-24 show that gross fixed capital formation as a percentage of GDP is the highest ever, at 34.9 percent. That’s still far below China’s investment peak of 50 percent of GDP in 2010 and its investment rate of above 40 percent of GDP since 2004 except for one year in between.Given the state of India’s infrastructure, a shift in the growth driver from consumption to investment demand may not be a bad thing.The Chicago Fed Adjusted National Financial Conditions Index shows that as on January 12, 2024, US financial conditions were looser than at any time since February 2022. Cash levels with global fund managers have moved up from 4.5 percent to 4.8 percent and the proportion of fund managers net overweight on equities has been trimmed. In other words, there’s plenty of liquidity for a rebound.As for India, the BofA Asia fund manager survey for January shows India a distant second-favourite, a net 18 percent overweight, while Japan is the star, with a net 59 percent of fund managers overweight on that market.The BofA survey also says both bond and equity investors believe that the Fed will be the number one driver of equity prices this year, even more than corporate earnings.Moreover, 72 percent of investors surveyed say equities, rather than long duration bonds or the US dollar, are the best way to play a Fed rate cutting cycle over the next six months. Expect equities, therefore, to ebb and flow with every twist and turn in the signals from the Fed.Cheers,Manas ChakravartyHere are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets:Stocks Epack Durable IPO, ICICI Lombard, Discovery Series: Tarsons Products, Federal Bank, Jio Financial, Fedbank Financial, Tata Consumer Products, Medi Assist IPO, Wipro, HCL Tech, D-Mart, MapmyIndia, Asian Paints, LTTS, Tata Consumer Products—execution remains key, Aarti Industries, IndusInd Bank, Ramkrishna ForgingsMarkets IPO rush isn't a bubble but out of 10 issuances, we may pick 1 or 2: Bandhan AMC’s Manish GunwaniWhat the markets want beyond elections?Can India’s bonds best their 2023 show?IPO euphoria extends to rights issuesWill India survive the global market turmoil in 2024?

Here, we examine the government's finances and whether it can meet its annual fiscal deficit targets.","The government has made impressive strides in recent years in reducing its fiscal deficit even as it stepped up massively on capital expenditure. From 9.2 percent of GDP in the pandemic-hit 2020-21, the Centre's fiscal deficit is on track to fall to 5.9 percent in 2023-24.According to economists, finance minister Nimrala Sitharaman may announce a target of around 5.3 percent of GDP for 2024-25 when she presents the interim budget on February 1. Such a figure would result in roughly half the fiscal consolidation the government needs to achieve by 2025-26 so that it can meet its medium-term target of 4.5 percent.Also Read: IMF, India cross swords over fiscal consolidation, forex market interventionHowever, it must be kept in mind that a fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent was only necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. And that the original target of 3 percent – as mandated by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act of 2003 – still stands. It's another matter than that target was to be achieved by 2008-09.Why is reducing the fiscal deficit so important? The government bridges the gap between its income and expenditure by borrowing from the market. Right now, the government's borrowings are so high that a fifth of all its spending is used to pay the interest on its debt.According to Fitch Ratings, there is ""less certainty"" on the Centre's fiscal consolidation path beyond the current year as ""trade-offs between economic growth and consolidation may become more acute"".""The CG's (central government) medium-term fiscal guidance is for a 4.5 percent of GDP deficit by 2025-26, but details on how this will be achieved are still limited. The CG has demonstrated a recent commitment to meeting fiscal targets, but reaching this target will require more than the 0.3 percentage point and 0.5 percentage point in deficit reduction in 2022-23 and 2023-24, respectively,"" Fitch said on January 16 while affirming its BBB- rating on India with a stable outlook.Moody's Investors Services, which also has India at the lowest investment grade rating, told Moneycontrol last year that it would take a fiscal deficit ""much narrower"" than 4.5 percent for the agency to reconsider its assessment of India's fiscal strength."

Private non-infrastructure business capex is conspicuous by its relative absence,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale, pointing to modest aggregate domestic demand while noting demand from the wealthy continued to make headlines.""Stress is more visible in the rural areas as the informal sector continues to struggle, especially MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) which are the biggest job generators."""

To understand how the Indian government plans to tackle this pressing issue, Moneycontrol Managing Editor, Nalin Mehta, held a fireside chat with Union Minister for Power and New & Renewable Energy RK Singh at the Policy Next summit held on January 18.The minister answered questions on a wide range of issues – from not being concerned about adding thermal power capacity, to the attitude of developed countries when it comes to energy transition – offering a glimpse into the future of India's energy policy.Also Read: Modinomics 3.0 and beyond – the best is yet to comeEdited excerpts:We hear a lot about the target of uninterrupted power supply over the next couple of years…It's here, it's now because the rules have already been promulgated. That's again something that I sort of hammered down in the meeting today with all the states – any load-shedding, you get penalised. It's (an uninterrupted power supply) there because the capacity is there, and the ability to transfer electricity from any corner to any corner is there – we have strengthened the distribution system. So there is no reason why any DISCOM should do load-shedding. So if they do load-shedding, they have to explain why and they have to compensate the consumers. Now, all that I am asking is for the consumers to stand up and complain. We have set up computer grievance redressal mechanisms in every division and every circle. So, (consumers should) file a complaint.A little earlier in the evening, we had Jayant Sinha, Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, addressing us from his constituency, Hazaribagh, and there was an issue (with electricity). That’s just a small example, but how do you get over those kinds of challenges at the ground level?Earlier, there was this misconception - since power is in the concurrent list, people felt that the state government has total control over distribution and the central government only looks after generation. Nonsense. The entire sector is in the concurrent list. That means the Centre has as much authority over distribution as the state has over generation. It's across the board. So, we made rules and those rules are made under law. They are subordinate legislation. They have been laid before Parliament. Any violation of the rule is a violation of the law and that entails penalties. And I have already told everybody that we shall prosecute you if you are in violation of the rules. And we have made rules which provide for this, that there shall be no load-shedding.Now why this load-shedding would be happening here and there – I am getting these (instances) investigated – is that some distribution companies may have run out of money for buying power. (For) also, I have made a system.I have been saying two or three things. One is that if you are a state chief minister or if you are a state power minister and you want to give subsidies, go right ahead. Give everybody a subsidy, give free electricity to everybody, I have no problems at all. But if you don't want the consumer to pay, you have to pay. So that subsidy amount has to be paid upfront; we have made rules. And if you don't pay the subsidy upfront, it does not get passed through.Second, you (DISCOMs) buy electricity from the generator (generating company), and you have to pay up. If you don't pay in 75 days, your connectivity to the exchange gets automatically cut off. Nobody can interfere. It's built into the system. If you delay for another 30 days, your short-term and medium-term access gets cut off. A further 30 days (of delay in payment) attracts cutting off of long-term access by 10 percent every month. So, if you do not pay up, gradually you won’t get electricity from anywhere.Now, this has proved so effective that the outstanding dues of Gencos used to be Rs 1.35 lakh crore in 2021 or so, that’s been brought down to about Rs 52,000 crore. And every month they pay installments to wipe that out. And current dues are paid every month. There is no outstanding dues payment.Now what would be happening somewhere is that some DISCOM may still not be viable enough, not have enough money to pay for the power. I have increased the viability – the losses have come down from 27 percent to 15 percent. And I have made rules to make sure that the losses come down. Now, some DISCOM may still be lagging. Now those DISCOMs have to be supported by the state government. Otherwise, they'll have to pay a penalty if that happens.We are getting into election season. In a Modi 3.0 government after the election, what would be, in your view, the three important priorities for the power ministry?One is capacity. The second is capacity. The third is to bring down the losses from 15 percent to about 10-12 percent.As far as energy transition is concerned, I am already a world leader. Earlier, all these guys from developed countries would come and they would start off by saying how necessary it is to carry out energy transition away from fossils. Now they don't, because I am doing better than them in energy transition. Now I talk to them, they don't talk to me. So as far as transition is concerned, I am well off. So capacity one, capacity two – because in spite of the fact that I have added almost total capacity of what use existed, I'm near doubling it, despite that, I still have to add more capacity.One of the things that you've spearheaded yourself and what the ministry has done very successfully is to put in place a system for timely payments from DISCOMs to generation companies. Now, while that is on track, there is an issue of legacy debt for the DISCOMs. So how do you handle that?That's what I brought down, the legacy dues. The current dues are all up-to-date. We are probably the only country in the world where the current payments for balance sheets drawn from Gencos are totally up to date. Legacy dues were Rs 1.35 lakh crores. Now, what I have done is that we said that any payment you make will first go against your legacy dues. So now, how do you manage it? Now, legacy dues, I made it in two installments. So I said that every month, you have to first pay that installment of legacy dues and then you have to pay the current bill. You have to do both. You can't pay the current bill without paying the legacy dues installment. So that is being paid. The current bills are being paid. And so (we have come down from) Rs 1.35 lakh crore to Rs 50,000 crore.If I may push you, any major announcements in your sector that we can expect in the interim budget?In the interim budget, I have several asks. I have placed that before the Ministry of Finance. Let us see.And what are your asks?Basically, I want more green finance. I want incentives for green hydrogen, etc. These are between me and Finance (Ministry).There is a projection that this year, the peak demand could be hitting about 256 GW. Are we prepared for that?Yes, I hope so. I have added capacity. I have 27,000 MW under construction, that is thermal. I'm trying to get that through as fast as possible. I have 99,000 MW of renewable energy under construction. I am also trying to get that through as fast as possible. So these are under construction. So these are in the pipeline.Also Read: We have ensured universal access to power; connected 29 mn homesI am now thinking of the next year, the year after that, so I am starting new capacities very quickly, renewable and thermal and hydro. Looking ahead, I see that as the major challenge before me. The fact is that if there is not enough power, our country will not grow at 7.5 percent. So it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we have that power because, without electricity, no industry is going to come. This is very clear. So we have all that capacity under construction. My installed capacity today is 4,26,000 MW. So the peak demand of 2,54,000 MW should not be an issue.But, in thermal what happens is that typically, on any given day, I would not have about 13,000-15,000 MW because of some niggle here or there. So one has to have that much reserve. The problem is not so much during the solar hours, because I have added that much renewable energy capacity. I am running neck-to-neck insofar as non-solar hours are concerned, where thermal is the requirement.Initially, there was a feeling that let's not add too much on thermal because we have to transition anyway. But the point is that storage is expensive. I came out with bids for storage: very expensive. I cannot afford to bill my people at Rs 12.50 (per unit) for electricity. It is Rs 10 a unit for storing electricity for one hour of renewable energy. So I still have to rely on thermal until and unless the storage costs come down. So I have to add thermal. So I'm adding thermal. And I don't make any apologies for it, plain and simple. Why? Because my per capita emissions are still the world's lowest. So I do not make any apologies. I am brazen about it. If needed, instead of 87, 000 MW, I will add 1,20,000 MW of thermal. But there's not going to be any shortage of electricity because without that we can't grow.Mr Singh, you spoke very forcefully about India being ahead of track for the renewable energy targets for 2030. This is something the Prime Minister has personally led from the front as well. I know he's also talked in the past of 100 percent over 2070 and so on. While we are ahead of track, how much investment is needed and where do you see that coming from to achieve the remaining targets?We are getting investment. Bloomberg rated us as the most attractive destination for investments in renewables in the world. So I am getting investments. I have no problems with that. What I need to do is to get more and more storage capacity. So we had one PLI (Production Linked Incentive) for manufacturing battery storage. Unfortunately, that first PLI focused almost entirely on mobility, for which you need a different type of storage. That type of storage is something that requires fast charging and fast discharge.The storage that we need for grid-scale, storing thousands of megawatts for 8-10-12 hours is different. So we are coming up with another bid for another PLI for storage which will be for grid-scale storage. Once that manufacturing happens, then the price of storage will come down. So, from Rs 10 it has already come down, globally, I believe to about Rs 6-7.5. But we want it to come down further.Pump storage is cheaper. Pump storage I am adding (capacity). We have surveyed all the possible sites and we are trying to operationalise it as soon as possible. That will cost me about Rs 3.5-4 per kilowatt hour. So once this gets on track, then I may not have to push so much for thermal. But till this gets on track, that is necessary because you need round-the-clock electricity.But I am getting investments. Even for storage, PLI, I am getting investments. For manufacturing of solar cells and modules right from polysilicon upwards, I am getting investment. So we are not having to put any money in. Our business world is now big enough.There was a push to indigenise manufacturing in this. So what's the response been and where do you think we are compared to Chinese manufacturers?First, what we did was, put customs barriers. Customs barriers were huge, and hefty. So 40 percent on modules, we are still there, and 25 percent on cells. Then we also came out with non-tariff barriers because what happened was that despite these customs barriers, you had manufacturing from, let's say, China being off-shored to countries with which we had an FTA. So basically, you stamp it with a country where we have an FTA and you escape the customs barrier. So we brought in a non-tariff barrier – an approved list of models and manufacturers. So that's worked.The net result of all this has been that the capacity of module manufacturing has gone up from about 20,000 MW to about 50,000 MW now. It's still going up further as much of the capacity is under construction. So I'll have, by 2030, about 24,000 MW of manufacturing capacity from polysilicon to modules, the entire value chain. And I've said that I am not going to accept anything below 19 percent efficiency. So that is another thing which I'm looking at. And this 19 percent efficiency, this lower threshold, will keep getting up. So maybe after a year or two years, I'll make it 21 percent as a lower threshold, and so on.So I already have a 50,000 MW manufacturing capacity of modules. Cells, polysilicon to modules, 24,000 MW by 2030 will be there, it's under construction. I will have the entire value chain of about 50,000 MW polysilicon to modules and 50,000 MW cell module by about 2030. So about 100,000 MW. We are already exporting now, to the United States, etc. That volume of exports is going to grow.Wind, I am already a leader. We export wind equipment already. Some larger capacity wind turbines have to be made here. So I have told my manufacturers that there's going to come a time when I am going to say that I will not accept any turbine, less than, let's say, 5 MW or whatever. But about 80-90 percent of the manufacturing is already here. We export from here.Hydrogen, I am going to be a leader, as I said.HVDC (high-voltage direct current) transmission lines, that is one field where I want entrepreneurs to get in. So some of the manufacturers are getting in.With thermal…what had happened was the world thought that we are moving away from thermals. So the manufacturing capacity of thermal equipment – boilers, steam turbines, etc have come down. We only have two manufacturers left. So that again has to increase.On the question of green hydrogen, this is something the Prime Minister has talked about. You have announced a whole bunch of incentives. What's the response been on the demand side since the incentives were announced?(The response has been) Great. We came out with a bid for PLI for making green hydrogen. It was oversubscribed, that bid. So that is good. We have also come out with a bid for manufacturing of electrolysers because the world capacity for making electrolysers is also limited. So that response has also been very good. So I am getting investments.Making of green hydrogen, apart from the PLI, people are setting up capacities by themselves also. So the capacities are being set up. The total capacities which are under different stages of planning is 7.8 million tonnes, which is pretty good and one of the largest in the world.Barriers set up by some countries is a worry. One country, I will not name it, gives $3 of subsidy per kilogram of green hydrogen. Some European countries have come out with other non-tariff barriers, saying that for the generation of renewable energy and electrolysers, the distance between them should not be more than 500 kilometers. These are non-tariff barriers. So we have said that you must remove these because you have been lecturing us, the developing world, about the values of free trade. Now why this protection? They have also got into agreements with other countries for importing green hydrogen lines, South American countries, etc. So, I questioned (this) and said ‘you should buy green hydrogen on the basis of open bids and then everybody will compete’. So those barriers will break down and we shall emerge as the biggest exporter in the world. I don't have any doubt about that. Because you can talk about making green hydrogen in Peru or Africa. They will have the sun no doubt, but you don't have the transmission. You don't have the ecosystem. They can't make green hydrogen cheaper than I can. So ultimately, I think the price will prevail.All these developed countries, apart from needing green hydrogen, also need carbon credits because they don't want to sacrifice their standards of living, which necessitates a large quantum of energy spent on heating, etc. They want carbon credits. So for green hydrogen, we will be giving carbon credits. Those who buy green hydrogen from here will get a part of the carbon credit. So we are getting into agreements, they want that. So ultimately, we shall be the major exporter.India is in a unique position where, while we are championing green energy in the way that you have outlined, we are also probably the only country in the world barring China which is also adding coal capacity. Now, there is a concern in certain quarters that globally the investment that is coming down. So are you concerned about that in terms of the investment for the extra capacity you're adding here?I have the money. The economy has the money. So finance is no issue at all, whatsoever. The fact is that different manufacturers are also coming and many of them are manufacturers from the West, who are going to give us equipment. So that is no issue.When it comes to reality, when it comes to facts, everybody's dualistic. For example, when the gas supplies from Russia got disrupted because of an attack, Germany started its thermal power plants, and the UK started its thermal power plants. Suddenly, all the statements emanating from the developed countries were not about transition, but about energy security. And they said that energy security is of paramount importance. So they bought gas from wherever. Now gas is a fossil. You burn gas, you emit carbon dioxide. So all this talk about how necessary it is to transition was gone. This is reality. So let there be no mistake – every country looks out for its interests of growth and the interests of its people. You have grown using fossil fuels. You – the developed world – are responsible for 85 percent of the carbon dioxide load which has caused this rise in temperature by 1.1 degree. Eight-five percent of that emission has come from developed countries. Our contribution is just about 3-4 percent, whereas my population is 17 percent of the global population. Our per capita emissions are one-third of the global average; the per capita emissions of Europe are three times the global average.So they (developed countries) are still spewing at the fastest rate. I am spewing at the least rate. They are responsible for 85 percent of global warming already. And they are not going to reduce their per capita consumption, let me tell you this. That's why they are on the lookout for carbon credits so that they can offset it. That is the main thing.So they talk and talk, but they haven't done anything. If they were serious about doing something, they would have worried round-the-clock about renewable energy; they would have added capacity for making storage batteries. They didn't do that. Why? Because they thought that just speeches and talks once a year when countries gather for COP would be sufficient."

Smurfit’s deal aims to combine businesses with a total market value of $19 billion before talks became public in September, reap synergies and capture the benefits of a New York listing and likely S&P 500 inclusion. Yet Smurfit would retain its Irish domicile and its chair, CEO and chief financial officer.The alternative US tie-ups don’t look so appealing. International Paper Co is too big for Smurfit to buy; Packaging Corp of America too richly valued. WestRock has had a difficult few years and its share rating has suffered. So Smurfit’s offer for the company is priced at a roughly comparable valuation to its own despite including a premium. Each side’s shareholders would own about half the enlarged business, sharing equally in merger-related savings.  The hope would be that new leadership can drive WestRock’s humdrum margins higher and the combined company’s shares will achieve a higher earnings multiple closer to better-rated US rivals.Investors aren’t so sure. Smurfit stock crumpled on the deal announcement. Primestone Capital LLP, a London-based activist fund, has articulated the key concern: WestRock is cheap for a reason. It thinks even Smurfit’s high-caliber management team could struggle to improve the performance of what it’s buying. Smurfit lacks the required breadth of US expertise and WestRock needs “catch-up” investment to modernise its plants, Primestone reckons.The activist fund would rather Smurfit returned cash to shareholders or did a radically different deal — selling itself to International Paper. Then Smurfit investors would be the ones getting the premium. The fact that International Paper made an aborted attempt to buy Smurfit in 2018 points to the strategic logic to such a tie-up. Coincidentally, the US packaging giant recently announced that CEO Mark Sutton would be stepping down. A deal could deliver a succession by handing the reins to Smurfit boss and scion of the founding family Tony Smurfit.Taken at face value, the challenge sounds unworkable. Fishing around for alternatives may even be contractually tricky for Smurfit. That said, there’s nothing stopping International Paper from making the first move. The activist’s public letter is addressed to the Irish side but is effectively an invitation to the one-time US suitor to try a renewed approach. For a company with a CEO heading for the exit, making such a move would be stunning — all the more so given Sutton failed last time. He recently told investors the firm’s approach to M&A would be “disciplined and selective.”Smurfit cannot be complacent. The WestRock transaction also faces the obstacle of a Smurfit shareholder vote. That needs 75 percent approval. The underperformance of Smurfit shares since the project surfaced suggests there’s much more to do to convince investors that buying a lower-rated company would be a boost not a drag. Primestone is, of course, in the criticism business; it’s also opposing a UK takeover involving buyout firm KKR & Co. Yet the fact remains that the activist has credibility as its team comprises former partners from US private equity firm Carlyle Group Inc who have overseen industrial turnarounds.Vocal attacks on any deal increase the risks for merger arbitrageurs betting on closure. The standard trade would involve short-selling the bidder’s shares and buying the target’s. A surprise counter-offer for Smurfit would see its shares rally, harming the short side of this equation. The same might go for a shareholder veto.But the situation is above all a warning to the European bosses who want to deal their way into the US. If you think M&A can help take a target off your back, beware that an activist may just try to stick it back on.Chris Hughes is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

The gathering, hosted by the World Economic Forum, has little to show for real progress beyond endless discussions if past shindigs are observed. Indeed, at best Davos is an offsite for government officials and businessmen and at worst, it resembles the physical form of social media platform X (twitter) if Hallmark had taken it over instead of Elon Musk.This Financial Times article titled 'In remembrance of Davos times past' presents the growing irrelevance of the platform. But for now, the Swiss Alpine town presents a place for India and developing nations to hard sell themselves.India is going all guns blazing to position itself as the destination for business, investment, and the next big thing: Artificial intelligence. Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw is convinced India will be a major semiconductor chip manufacturer in five years. Heads of business conglomerates have done their bit in drumming up their support for the economy and, also getting a large platform to network for their businesses. You can catch all that happened and was said through our extensive coverage of Davos here.India’s central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das is also presenting the economy’s prospects in his own genial way. Das said India’s growth momentum will sustain, and real GDP growth could surprise around 7 percent. Unlike the jawboning of government officials, Das’s statements do not come out as an attempt at self-praise but rather are rooted in data. Macroeconomic data has been robust for the Indian economy in recent times and the proof of the pudding is the rise and rise of the Indian stock market.In short, Indian leaders want the world to take that leap of faith towards its growth promise.Back home too, Das and his deputies have chronicled the economy’s strength in the Reserve Bank of India’s monthly bulletin. “The international confidence on India’s prospects is at a new high; it is an opportune time to make this India’s moment and work towards strong, sustainable and inclusive growth,” the state of the economy article in the bulletin said. It can easily double up as a pick-up line at a platform such as Davos.For all the schmoozing at Davos on economic progress, the unease on current geopolitical tensions is apparent among leaders. Ebullient financial markets, falling inflation, and the absence of recession are not enough to dispel the fears that stem from the ongoing wars in Europe and the Middle East. This FT article titled Geopolitical risks overshadow economic optimism in Davos by Sam Flemming captures the mood at Davos that seems bereft of what the economic backdrop would inspire.In fact, stock markets are ignoring the event and focusing on geopolitics amid worries that bets of better growth and rate cuts have become far too aggressive. That explains why equities across the world are advancing, but are yet to show their best behaviour. Indian markets have been hit by an unhappy set of earnings from one of its blue-chip banks, HDFC Bank. The troubles of HDFC Bank may not speak for the whole economy, but there are pockets that should worry investors. Ananya Roy in her piece explains that the current market shake-up is a result of deeper worries than one bank’s disappointing performance.Even as India’s growth prospects are expected to be driven by a virtuous investment cycle, policymakers are still unable to explain the sharp deceleration in private consumption which contributes more than half of gross domestic product. If Indians, among the biggest consumers in the world, are not consuming, there is a reason to worry. An investment-led growth model has its limitations and unless consumption demand is generated, what the economy would be stuck with is excess capacity.Davos shows an India that is affluent, that consumes luxury goods, and goes after wealth creation. But there is another India that lines up for free food, employment under government schemes and subsidies. This too has been growing in recent months. As R Srinivasan writes in an aptly titled India: A marketer's dream or Piketty's nightmare?, policymakers must address the growing inequality in growth which could only worsen from here.Davos has made it evident that India is a marketer’s dream. But it must avoid the nightmare of worsening inequality if it wants investors to take that leap of faith.Investing insights from our research teamWeekly Tactical Pick: Why the banking behemoth’s long-term prospects can’t be missedEpack Durable IPO: Should you subscribe to this major AC player?IndusInd Bank Q3 FY24: A mixed bagAarti Industries: Increasing share of long-term contractsRamkrishna Forgings is riding the CV upswing, but stock at an elevated levelWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: HDFC Bank and Yudhisthira’s chariot, Thalapathy boards Cochin Shipyard, the 'no-brainer' warrant gameBudget Snapshot: Do tax resets make Indians change investments?Budget 2024: Should investors be expecting a push to consumption?Needed: Granular, high frequency data to fight multi-dimensional povertyGeopolitical risks will be the main driver of oil prices in 2024Boeing-Airbus duopoly is a pain for customers and a lesson for competition regulatorsSugar mills face another hit from higher UP sugarcane costPersonal Finance: Travel insurance to the rescue?Is AI the new mantra to merely trim headcount?Private equity predicts deal rebound as sellers capitulate on prices(republished from the FT)Union Budget 2024: Make domestic demand drivers the central theme on February 1Worsening Pakistan-Iran Relations: Who is to blame?Global Chip Rebound: TSMC thanks you for your love of chat botsPhilippines’ baby bust will one day be a global labour problemPersonal FinanceComing soon: A new regulator to monitor your fintech apps.

Once CKYC is implemented, all other KYC procedures may become redundant. The financial institutions may need to implement this new regime.Issues related to CKYCSince CKYC is not integrated with other KYC repositories, customers may have to provide KYC documents again and again. The meeting is likely to discuss these issues, he said.The Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest of India (CERSAI) acts as the Central KYC Records Registry.CERSAI MD & CEO Umesh Kumar Singh, HDFC Bank MD & CEO Sashidhar Jagdishan, ICICI Bank MD & CEO Sandeep Bakhshi, State Bank of India Chairman Dinesh Kumar Khara and Punjab National Bank MD & CEO Atul Kumar Goel are also likely to attend the high-level meet.The government believes that once fully implemented, CKYC will benefit investors with cost optimisation, inter-usability of KYC records in the financial sector and convenience of uploading documents in one place.In April last year, the RBI, in a circular, had designated the customers onboarded through CKYC as high-risk, which led to banks going slow on incorporating it into their system."

""As the world looks to build more resilient supply chains, India becomes a natural production platform for people.

With Philippines determined to reduce its birthrate, its impact will be felt everywhere from London hospital wards and Los Angeles wharves to dinner tables across the Middle East","The next big demographic jolt is coming in a country whose human capital keeps essential portions of the global economy afloat. Its impact will be felt everywhere from London hospital wards and Los Angeles wharves to dinner tables across the Middle East.While still a relatively young nation, the Philippines is determined to reduce its birthrate, and sees much smaller families as a route to the prosperity enjoyed elsewhere. It wants a place in the pantheon of Asian success stories alongside nations like Singapore and Malaysia. The archipelago of 115 million people has already made meaningful progress, thanks in part to the reduced sway of the Roman Catholic Church and the ensuing easing of restrictions on contraception.Worries about a baby drought and decades-later silver tsunami of too many old people are for societies that have already grown rich. They are tomorrow’s problems. Family planning volunteer Remy Cabello embodies the changes underway — she raised two children, but has a dozen siblings. “People are becoming more knowledgeable,” Cabello told me during her rounds in one of Manila’s poorest neighbourhoods. With smaller families,“they can budget their money, they can give a better education to their kids, give sufficient financial support and nutrition. They are taking care not just of their kids, but of their lives.”What matters for Manila is capitalizing on the momentum generated by sharp declines in fertility and using the coming decade or two to invest in education, technology and infrastructure. Consistent and pronounced reductions in the size of families were key characteristics of the rapid economic takeoff enjoyed by South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China. That enabled huge inroads in curbing poverty and left the rising, increasingly urbanized middle class with more cash and an expanding array of consumer goods. For governments, the idea is to use the window to make the leap to industrialization and a workforce equipped for a modern economy. It’s a concept replete with opportunity, and huge hurdles, for the Philippines.For the world labor market, though, this is a slow-burning challenge. Filipinos perform critical, though often under-appreciated, roles in social and economic systems far from home. This isn't simply about agencies in Hong Kong and Singapore having enough domestic helpers to supply middle-class households. Nor is it just guys working construction in the Middle East. Healthcare systems in the US and Europe have come to rely on nurses from the Philippines; recruiters fan out to colleges and clinics, offering spotting fees into the thousands of dollars for referrals of friends and colleagues.The Philippines also supplies about a quarter of the seafarers that keep container vessels on the seas. On any morning along a busy avenue in central Manila, agents wave signs seeking ship pilots, cooks and maintenance crews. Touts offer payday loans to merchant mariners. For those looking to quickly get qualified, maritime textbooks are on sale.Until recently, the nation has been a very youthful standout in a region getting old quickly. It’s not just Japan and Korea; China’s populationextended a historic decline last year. Lackluster economic performances in Western Europe have been attributed to stagnant, or worse, demographics.For the Philippines itself, that would be a good problem to have. No sovereign nation should gear its development strategy around making sure that tony districts in Hong Kong or Dubai have enough live-in helpers. Nor is it the job of policymakers in Manila to fret about whether hospices in Minnesota or Ohio have enough staff. We all like the stuff crammed into the holds of the hundreds of tankers delivering goods to our ports, but as consumers and households, it’s incumbent on us to be more aware of the labour that gets us through the day.Henlyn Atanacio and her family are a great example. For generations, they have been going the distance. “I want to give my family a better life, which I can do abroad because of the higher compensation,” noted Atanacio, an associate dean at Manila Central University’s college of nursing. She applied for a job in Canada and is hoping her husband and son can accompany her. Her sisters were both nurses in South Korea and France. Her mother, now in France, is a domestic helper.The urban professional class has needed little convincing that fewer offspring were desirable; they simply mirrored the inclinations of their cohorts in other up-and-coming economies. A broader milestone for women came in 2012, with the passage of a bill that lifted many restrictions on the use and availability of contraception. Fought doggedly by religious conservatives, the law was a big win for women.Manila has come late to the decline in fertility rates that critics say are now dangerously entrenched across Asia. That’s what made the findings of the most recent five-year survey of the country's headcount, in 2022, so startling: The total fertility rate dived below 2.1 live births per woman, the level at which a population naturally replenishes itself. An economic adviser at the Asian Development Bank described its retreat to 1.9 as “jaw dropping,” compared with the 2.7 logged in 2017 and the 3.0 recorded four years prior to that. While Covid may have exaggerated the recent fall, no informed observer I spoke to on a recent trip quibbled with the direction.This isn’t an imminent crisis. The Philippine countryside isn’t about to empty, nor are robots going to replace waitstaff or check guests into hotels. But the experience of wealthy economies is that once the trend toward smaller households begins, it can be devilishly hard — if not impossible — to reverse. Leaders may find themselves a generation or two later wondering where all the people have gone. Manila will need to be awake to this danger. Reliable data, and more of it, more often, is critical.Lisa Grace Bersales, executive director of the population commission, calls these concerns premature. Filipinos have the right, but shouldn’t feel the compulsion, to migrate for a paycheck. “No more nannies in Singapore, that is what we hope for, and maybe no more construction workers in other countries,’’ she told me. “That’s what could happen. But, in our culture, if one sees that one has worked out of the country and seems to have big houses, good cars, they usually also dream of having such an experience... If we are successful, there will be less of them.”More than half the nurses who complete their studies leave for work abroad. Pay and conditions are a big, often decisive factor. Ties to relatives overseas, many of whom are nurses themselves, also encourage the flow. The pandemic was a wake-up call. Local hospitals buckled as infections surged. At one point, authorities barred nurses from leaving the country.Vilma Bonifacio is the first to admit that she is an aberration. Also an associate dean, she opted to stay in the Philippines to be close to her children; her husband is a seafarer. Bonifacio reckons that of her 1996 graduation class, only six remained behind. Around 75 percent of current students will end up overseas, she estimates. “Our schools are cutting enrollments for the lack of teachers,” she lamented. “How can we sustain the number of nurses for the Philippines, or even globally, if the numbers are so short?”Exodus isn’t all negative. Remittances provide a steady flow of funds that account for around 10% of gross domestic product. That won't be turned off overnight, nor should it be. It’s part of the balancing act for Arsenio Balisacan, the prominent academic who is secretary of the National Economic and Development Authority. During the boom run of East Asian economies that began in the 1980s, sky-high growth bypassed the Philippines. While neighbors enmeshed themselves in manufacturing supply chains, the Philippines missed its time in the sun. Harnessing the so-called demographic divided is key to making amends.The working-age population is starting to grow faster than dependent groups. That could easily add a couple of percentage points to economic growth over time. “It’s a big bonus,” he told me. “Unfortunately, it won’t last long. In the Philippines context, it may last one to two decades.” The benefit of a second dividend will come only if the country can make this group more productive by investing in the quality of workers.While it’s time to jettison stereotypes about Filipinos having large families, there’s also a city-rural divide. The Manila area saw its total fertility rate decline to 1.2, well below the national figure, while it’s 3.1 in an autonomous region of the southern island of Mindanao. “People are becoming more aware of their opportunities,” explained Carmela Aquino-Cabral, a fertility specialist at Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital, one of Manila’s largest maternity hospitals. “There’s more to life than being a mom.”The ground war matters greatly. One recent morning, I accompanied a team of volunteers from the Likhaan Center for Women’s Health into the Tondo district, one of the capital’s most impoverished. The lanes were narrow and muddy. Satay and fish cooked on open-air stoves; children scampered about while parents or grandparents leaned out the windows of makeshift shops.We were a few miles, and a whole world, away from the glass towers, fashionable cocktail bars and five-star hotels of the Makati enclave. It’s a regular beat for Cabello and her three colleagues. These women are foot soldiers of a demographic revolution that's gaining converts block by block — they hope. “I do share my own experiences, I am using the pill,” said Cabello. “In the long run, people will believe in us.”  There are no easy solutions for developed nations so reliant on imported labour. Strengthening tertiary education and vocational training is vital, as is addressing poor pay and working conditions for professions like nursing. For its part, the Philippines must tread carefully — it still has a long way to go before it becomes an aged society, but there is always the danger of overcorrection and being left, like others in the region, with a labour shortage of its own.Daniel Moss is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

And it’s using an incentive structure that has a history of unpleasant side effects on — you guessed it — humanity,"OpenAI is expanding beyond nifty products like ChatGPT and has announced that it is following through with its pledge to distribute AI’s benefits to all of humanity.Just kidding!It’s actually launched a “store” to monetise its language model technology and share that wealth with other businesses. And it’s using an incentive structure that has a history of unpleasant side effects on — you guessed it — humanity.The “GPT Store” is available to OpenAI’s enterprise customers and anyone who pays $20 a month to use ChatGPT Plus, offering a selection of specialised versions of the tool in areas like research, education and design that are created by third-party developers. Think of them like apps that you talk to via chatbot. For instance, I asked the “AllTrails” GPT to recommend running routes in my town, and it provided a list of ideas with links to maps. “Coloring Book Hero” generated some pictures of copyrighted characters for my kids to scribble all over, and the “Books” GPT churned out a list of wilderness survival novels after I told it that I’d re-watched The Revenant.OpenAI says developers have already created more than 3 million of these GPTs, which led The Atlantic to point out that this was ChatGPT’s“FarmVille Moment.” Indeed, this harks back to when Facebook allowed other software engineers to create apps for the site back in 2007, helping it become a sprawling platform. But OpenAI’s store is similar to Facebook in a more disturbing way too: It has an engagement-based revenue structure.Builders “will be paid based on user engagement with their GPTs,” OpenAI has said, which means that the more popular, engaging and potentially addictive a GPT service is, the more money its developers can make. (The company said it will give further details on how those payments will work at some point in the first quarter.) OpenAI might be the world’s leading AI firm, but it is harnessing one of the most established business models on the internet.Companies from Facebook to YouTube to e-commerce sites and news organisations use engagement as their primary metric for paying, or charging, third parties. That has made attention the currency that drives our online economy. Facebook’s business model, for instance, revolves around maximising user engagement to drive ad revenue. The more time people spend on the platform, the more ads they can be shown. YouTube pays creators based on the number of views their videos receive, while TikTok pays influencers based on their followers’ engagement with their posts. Many news sites like Forbes.com have also paid writers based on page views. The great benefit of this model has been to make most of the content on the internet free. But there are plenty of downsides too. By prioritising content that keeps people on Facebook for longer, its algorithms often show posts that spark outrage. That has created political echo chambers and lured people into groups that spread conspiracy theories.YouTube’s model has led creators to focus on sensational or controversial content to drive views, motivating influencers to post provocative videos, while news sites have gravitated over the last decade toward sensationalist, click-bait headlines, many of them focused on trending topics instead of in-depth journalism. The engagement-based model has even affected TV. David Chase, the creator of The Sopranos, recently complained that the golden age of television had come to an end after he was warned by executives to not make shows that “require an audience to focus.”Sam Altman has previously denied that OpenAI used engagement as part of its business model. When he testified before Congress last year, the OpenAI CEO concurred with a lawmaker who warned the company against repeating the mistakes of social media networks. “We try to design systems that do not maximise for engagement,” Altman replied. “We’re not an advertising based model. We’re not trying to get people to use it more and more.” But other developers likely will, and the GPT Store doesn’t have to be ad-based to maximise for engagement. Subscription models like Netflix Inc. do that too, and are leading members of today’s attention economy.One thing that seems to be drawing people’s attention to AI is relationships. Based on a cursory search of what’s currently available, dozens of developers have already submitted “girlfriend” bots to OpenAI’s store. Users can only seek relationship advice or engage in friendly chat with these bots, since OpenAI’s forbids developers from launching ones that foster “romantic companionship.” Yet with more than three-million-and-counting GPTs to oversee and likely more to come, it’ll get harder to ensure all of them follow those rules.OpenAI is cracking open a Pandora’s Box of potential side effects with its adoption of a business model that has already reshaped human behaviour in repugnant ways. Social media companies whose algorithms subtly encouraged toxic activity often failed to enforce their guidelines banning that behavior. OpenAI can set itself apart from its predecessors if it can enforce those guidelines properly. That would be a welcome change, but it will be tough to pull off.Parmy Olson is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg "

Edited excerpts:Do you expect any major announcements for the infrastructure sector from the upcoming interim budget? Nothing major is expected from it. I would be very happy if there were no changes in policy in the budget because that is political etiquette in an election year. This is just to keep business going for a few months and we don’t expect any dramatic announcements.Private sector capex has been muted in the last few years. But some data, like from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), indicate that there has been some pickup in private sector capex. How do you read this?CMIE data refers to the overall capex in the economy. I would like to restrict my comments to infrastructure. There is still a lot of reluctance among private sector boards about the sanctity of PPP, particularly BOT (build, operate, transfer) projects, where they have to put balance sheet money for 15-30 years. There is still a huge degree of apprehension and the appetite will remain missing unless the government demonstrates some very clear changes in the PPP structure. The finance ministry has restrained NHAI (National Highways Authority of India) from raising further loans. As a result, fresh orders from NHAI have dipped substantially. MoRTH (Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) and NHAI are working at breakneck speed to recraft the model concession agreement. The new PPP model is expected to take away the many ills of the older model and create a far more level playing field. There is a strong case to revise the BOT model in the road sector because NHAI may not be in a position to raise more debt. This is a work in progress and we look forward to seeing what the new format will be.Private sector participation in PPP has completely dried up and even heavyweights like Larsen & Toubro have decided to not participate in developing projects; they would rather just be contractors. Do you see a broad revival in capex?The revival of PPP is a story waiting to unfold; it can move in either direction. Two major transport sectors—railways and roads—have not seen any substantial investments from the private sector in greenfield developments. But there are still sectors where private sector investment is coming in, such as is in renewable energy. Both domestic and international private investment is coming into solar, wind, pump storage, etc, because of the nature of the contracts and the assurances available.For coal thermal, there are a lot of restrictions on financiers due to ESG (environmental, social, and corporate governance) issues. But India is committed to adding 10,000-20,00 megawatts of fresh coal capacity now per annum in the medium term. I believe a large portion of that will be done by the public sector because global private financiers are unwilling to finance coal today because of climate change concerns.There is a very strong interest in investing in social infrastructure; there is a scramble to invest in new hospitals because there is such an untapped demand there. That’s one space where the private sector is moving in aggressively. On the digital side, there is a huge move to create data centres. Some interest is coming into ropeway projects too but the broad story is that the private sector is still not going to reach the level that we saw at the end of the 12th Plan (referring to the five-year timetables set by the erstwhile Planning Commission), where of the total infrastructure investment, the private sector accounted for around 38 percent. That was the peak, now the share will not be more than 5-7 percent.Do you anticipate a gap in the investment needed and what the private sector may want to invest? Will the government have to keep pushing its capex?Broadly speaking, to meet India's aspirations of providing quality infrastructure to its people, we need a minimum of 8 percent GCFI (gross capital formation in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP). At current market prices, our GDP is Rs 330 lakh crore, 8 percent of this as infra investments means Rs 26 lakh crore. So ideally, India should have spent Rs 26 lakh crore when the current fiscal ends if we want 8 percent GFCI. Some back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the CAG’s  (Comptroller and Auditor General of India) recent report this year indicate that the central government is likely to do capex of about Rs 10 lakh crore.Typically, the thumb rule in the infrastructure sector is that when the central government spends, say, X amount, an equal X amount comes from the other three players—states, the private sector, and EBR (extra-budgetary resources). In FY24, at worst, India will be doing Rs 20 lakh crore spend, and, at best, it may even touch Rs 22 lakh crore-23 lakh crore. It is still lower than 8 percent GFCI which will be Rs 26 lakh crore, but it is still within striking distance.Based on this math, next year,  if the GDP grows in current price terms at 12 percent, which includes 7 percent growth and 5 percent inflation, it will be at Rs 370 lakh crore. Using the same thumb rule, 8 percent of this is Rs 30 lakh crore and if the central government has to do half of it, the budget allocation would have to be Rs 15 lakh crore.Given that the last budget allocation was Rs 10 lakh crore, this would translate into a 50 percent increase in the next budget. This takes into account the fact that private sector interest is still not fully there. This math can be extrapolated to assess the requirements of the country and how much the government will have to spend in the years ahead.In the last budget, the government extended the moratorium of the 50-year interest-free loan aggregating to Rs 1.3 lakh crore that state governments have by another year. Do you think there will be some announcement on that in the interim budget as well?Yeah, I think they will extend it. I do not think the whole amount has been utilised; they will extend it.Do you expect any announcement on asset monetisation in infrastructure in the budget?It has not been a satisfying story. The total disinvestment across sectors as well as infrastructure monetisation has been far below expectations. But we can’t expect these announcements in an interim budget.Do you expect some announcements given the upcoming general election?I doubt it. The election will not be fought on an interim budget."

This year, then, has been about letting those rate cuts filter through.""The macro environment of resilient growth and anchored core inflation amid food inflation risks is setting the stage for an extended pause by the RBI, in our view,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi noted on January 12.""However, as inflation trends closer to 4 percent, core inflation remains anchored, and the global rate cycle pivots, the RBI is likely to shift its focus to growth and will likely be alert to the risks of overtightening.""Indeed, the word ""overtightening"" has already found its way into the RBI's commentary. However, as Governor Shaktikanta Das has warned, that should not be taken as a sign of future action but that hasn't stopped economists.""With the global monetary policy backdrop turning more benign, we bring forward our rate cutting cycle, now expecting RBI to deliver interest rate reductions from April-June 2024, probably in the June MPC (meeting), with three 25 basis points rate cuts most likely to be delivered in calendar year 2024, one each quarter starting in June,"" Rahul Bajoria, Managing Director and Head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said."

Here, we examine the recent run of higher-than-expected growth prints and what that means for 2024-25.","It will not be an understatement to say the Indian economy's performance in 2023-24 has been a positive surprise. After clocking a growth rate of 7.2 percent in 2022-23, the world's fastest growing large economy was expected to slow down this year, with even the government and the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) start-of-the-year forecasts of 6.5 percent seen as rather optimistic.However, such has been the pace of growth that the Indian central bank was, in December 2023, forced to raise its prediction to 7 percent. Less than a month later, the statistics ministry's first advance estimate of pegged the current year's GDP growth rate at 7.3 percent.Also Read: India's most optimistic economist just got even more bullishSure, this is only an advance estimate and additional data could result in the number being lowered in the coming months. But it is difficult to deny that growth momentum is strong. The question to now ask is whether growth can improve further next year. The consensus, as was the case at the start of 2023-24, is no.""Growth estimates for this fiscal have surpassed our expectations,"" CRISIL economists said in a note on January 5.""Nevertheless, the first advance estimates bake in a slowdown in the second half relative to the first half of this fiscal,"" they further said, adding that they expect the ""slowdown to continue next fiscal"" due to a variety of factors, including slowing global growth, the impact of higher interest rates and fiscal consolidation, fading away of pent-up demand, and global geopolitical uncertainty.""Persisting unrest in the Middle East is a risk to global trade flows and commodity prices. Rising crude oil prices can particularly disrupt India's growth,"" CRISIL said.All good points. But credit where its due and we will let the RBI have the last word. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 17, Governor Shaktikanta Das said India is likely to grow 7 percent in 2024-25. Given Das' recent track record of getting growth surprises right, one would question the central bank chief's optimism at their own risk."

Here, we examine the level of total public debt and what it means for the government's finances","The coronavirus pandemic resulted in governments across the world taking on a pile of debt to support their economies. India was no different, with its total debt — Centre plus states — rising to 89.5 percent of the GDP in 2020-21 from 75.3 percent in the previous year.Since then, the debt has come down as growth has rebounded. In 2022-23, India's general government debt was 86.5 percent of GDP. The problem is that it is not seen falling much in the medium term.""We forecast overall net general government debt will stabilise just below 85 percent of GDP over the next three years,"" S&P Global Ratings said in May 2023 as it affirmed its BBB- rating on India.Reducing debt levels is crucial to India securing a better credit rating, which would allow it and Indian companies get access to finances at cheaper rates. And the ""government's weak fiscal performance and burdensome debt stock"" are a counterbalance to the country's strengths, S&P saidIt is not as if the government does not recognise the gravity of the matter. In October, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the ministry is looking at ways to reduce the level of debt of the government.""Compared to many others (countries) it might not be as high as it is. But even there, we are consciously looking at experiments in different parts of the world,"" the minister had said.Debt can be reduced in two ways. One, there are no incremental additions to the stock of debt. This would reduce debt in absolute terms. However, with the government spending more than it earns, this is unlikely to occur for India.The other route to reduce debt – as a percentage of GDP – is to have a high rate of nominal growth. The issue here is that while India's real growth rate has exceeded expectations recently, the nominal rate of growth – or growth without adjusting for inflation – has been lower than expected."

Here, we examine how inflationary pressures have evolved over the last few years and what current trends say about the near future","On the surface, the latest retail inflation data for India is not overtly comforting. At 5.69 percent, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation in December 2023 was at a four-month high, though everything else seemingly suggests that the situation is far better than the headline number indicates.The rise in inflation in December which, it must be pointed out, came in lower than economists' projection of 5.9 percent, was on the back of an unfavourable base effect. At the same time, core inflation eased to another multi-year low of 3.9 percent.Also read: Tech, infra key to easing food supply issues in the long run, says MPC's Shashanka BhideBut policymakers neither mourn nor hail a single month's inflation number. What matters is the trend. And, as far as India is concerned, 2023-24 has been about inflation easing after a difficult few years, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Until the pandemic struck India in early 2020, it had been a fairly smooth sail for the authorities, with the adoption of the flexible inflation targeting framework – first, informally, in early 2014, and then, formally, in mid-2016 – doing what was exactly hoped as the CPI inflation dropped from 9.4 percent in 2012 to 4 percent or lower in 2017, 2018, and 2019.A key driver of inflation – not just now, but always – has been food prices. But, with uneven and unseasonal rains becoming more commonplace due to climate change and impacting agricultural production, the role of the government in taking supply-side measures to contain price rise has become crucial. The RBI has gone so far as to say that ""major reforms"" are needed to the country's supply chains of perishable items such as vegetables.Going forward, the RBI expects the CPI inflation to finally hit its medium-term target of 4 percent in the second quarter of 2024-25 before rising again towards the end of 2024."

Latha Venkatesh, executive editor, CNBC-TV18 in her column with Moneycontrol Pro argues whether the worst is behind the stock, or, more importantly, will it regain its lost glory?But it is not just the earnings, which are a reflection of the past quarter, that tripped markets. There is a clear change in the global macroeconomic narrative beginning with the US Federal Reserve’s ability to pivot on rates. Data on US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December came in above expectations, showing that inflation is still sticky. This, along with robust job numbers, might make the Fed hold off interest rate cuts in Q1. The sharp rise in bond yields underscored this sentiment.Adding heft to this belief is the comment by Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director of the IMF, citing a “bumpy” path towards lower inflation. Read more on this here (FT article specially available for MCPro subscribers) where she suggests that rates should not be lowered until the second half of the year.As if this is not bad enough, there is rising geopolitical tensions with the Gaza-Israel war that seems to be now spreading to other regions such as Iran and Pakistan, apart from the tension in the Red Sea. While these may appear to be political issues, the economic ramifications will be felt sooner than later. A Reuters report states that Red Sea ship diversions boost bunker demand and prices in Africa and the Mediterranean.To be sure, analysts often stress on the “bottom-up” approach in stock picking. But this does not imply brushing aside the big picture macroeconomic milieu that finally trickles down to impact economies and company fortunes too. Besides, it is not always that analysts get their bets right.A case in point is HDFC Bank. Bloomberg reports 44 analysts with buy recommendations, six with “hold” recommendations, and none advising to sell, despite the bank's poor performance.There are other such instances too where valuations could be questionable.

The nation’s economic bubble had already begun to burst, and early that next year the index tumbled. The S&P 500 has gained some 1,200 percent since then, while the Nikkei has yet to scale those heights once more.But after an unexpectedly vigorous start to 2024, the blue-chip index suddenly finds itself less than a 10 percent gain away from finally overcoming that record. Everyone from local retail traders to Chinese investors seeking refuge from the underperforming mainland market are buying into Japan at the start of 2024. Though many analysts expected a new Japan record sometime this year, few would have expected that — at least at the current pace — it could come by the end of this month.Not only did the earthquake that struck the Noto peninsula on New Year’s Day fail to burst the enthusiasm from 2023, the disaster might ironically have lent support to Japanese markets. Foreign investors were quick to note how soon much of the afflicted region was back on its feet, with the Shinkansen bullet train line closest to the affected areas up and running in less than 24 hours — a clear demonstration of Japan’s resilience. Others have speculated the quake also further pushes back any chance of a sudden interest-rate hike by the Bank of Japan.This week also saw another big step toward surpassing 38,915.87. Monday’s eagerly anticipated release of the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s “name and shame” list — highlighting which firms have publicised steps they’re taking to improve their corporate value — should give heart to those who think 2024 will mark the end of stocks’ lost decades.At first glance, the fact that some 60 percent of prime-listed companies — in theory, corporate Japan’s best-in-class — have so far failed to present plans to improve their share prices might seem disheartening. The likes of Toyota Motor Corp. and Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing Co. were among them. Worse, nearly 90 percent of companies on the catch-all standard market have yet to disclose their plans.But the absences also show that the TSE’s water-torture campaign that slowly applies pressure to improve still has a long way to run. Nearly half of the 1,655 prime members trade below book value, compared with just 3 percent of the S&P 500. Encouragingly, those firms were the most likely to have disclosed their attempts to boost their stocks.And Japan Exchange Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Hiromi Yamaji has said that he wants value to be improved over the long-term, rather than juiced by temporary buybacks, and likened Japan’s until-recent malaise to the “death of equities” period in the US that preceded the 1980s Reaganomics boom. The pressure is definitely working; Jefferies analysts termed it a “giant leap towards structural transformation” of the Japanese market. For so much of the market to be focused on improving corporate value is simply unheard of.The groundwork for all this was laid nearly a decade ago, during the Abenomics program of former premier Shinzo Abe. But as with much in Japan, hopes for early success were too high — and later improvements went unnoticed. Yamaji himself is a key player, seemingly far more committed than his predecessors to nudging and nagging firms into compliance. Those that don’t want to be listed can take advantage of Japan’s cheap money to take themselves off the market.And the campaign from the Tokyo bourse continues. Next year, it will reportedly at long last require prime-listed firms to make corporate disclosures in English as well as Japanese, something that has been woefully lacking for most companies, despite Tokyo’s frequent attempts to promote itself as an international financial hub.There are plenty more encouraging signs. When the BOJ does lift rates back to zero, some might get cold feet, but everyone agrees that’s now unlikely to happen before April at the earliest. The market has also finally become comfortable with the idea that even if the BOJ abandons its negative-rate experiment, it doesn’t follow that it will embark on a rapid hiking cycle like other central banks. Warren Buffett himself is also indirectly helping: The sogo shosha trading houses he invested in back in 2020 are among the best performers in the country this year, with traders noting remarks from Sumitomo Corp.’s CEO that Buffett is continuing to increase his stakes in the five firms. (Don’t get too carried away; even the Oracle of Omaha is required to submit a regulatory filing for every 1 percent increase in his stake.)And then there’s the news Wednesday that the market is so in demand among Chinese investors that the largest onshore exchange-traded fund tracking Japanese stocks was temporarily paused due to a surge in demand. In recent years Japan has benefited from its position as an investing alternative to China, but until now it’s rarely been Chinese stockholders themselves holding this view. It’s a meaningful change if even the mainland is catching up to the notion that Japan isn’t an investment wilderness.Of course, there’s no guarantee that 2024 will be the year 38,915.87 crumbles. Those same longtime stock watchers (fewer each year) have seen this euphoria before — and know how quickly the tides can turn, especially if Japan’s ponderous pace of change doesn’t align with an overly bullish sentiment. A rout in Chinese stocks, a potential recession and regional tensions are all concerns. But if there was ever a moment for the country to record a new high watermark, this might be it.Gearoid Reidy is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering Japan and the Koreas.

All other posts in the Commission have already been created as per the delegated powers, the government added.The announcement comes days after the Cabinet appointed Arvind Panagariya, the former vice-chairman of Centre's topmost think-tank NITI Aayog and a professor of Columbia University, as the chairman of the 16th Finance Commission on December 31.The 16th Finance Commission will make its report available by October 31, 2025.Earlier, the Cabinet had on November 29 approved the terms of reference for the 16th Finance Commission, which will recommend how taxes are shared between the Centre and states and also among states.The recommendations of the commission, which will be notified in due course, will cover a period of five years starting April 1, 2026.The terms of reference will include the distribution of the net proceeds of taxes between the Centre and the states and the allocation between the states of the respective shares of such proceeds, the principles, grants-in-aid and the revenues of the states and measures needed to supplement the resources of the panchayats, the statement said.The 15th Finance Commission, chaired by NK Singh, was set up on November 27, 2017 and made recommendations for a period of six years from April 1, 2020. Its recommendations remain valid till the financial year 2025-26.The finance commission normally takes about two years to make its recommendations. The Constitution says that the finance commission has to be constituted every fifth year or earlier.Since the recommendations of the 15th commission covered the six-year period up to March 31 2026, the next commission is being proposed to be constituted now."
212,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/blackstone-and-blackrock-master-the-art-of-moneymaking-12075031.html,Blackstone and BlackRock master the art of moneymaking,"January 18, 2024 11:50 AM IST","After blowing past major milestones — the pair now manages over $1 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively — Blackstone and BlackRock needed to show investors they still have a good story to tell. The two multi-billion dollar deals they just sealed showcase just that","Two major events are shaking up the asset-management world. Blackstone Inc raised $1.3 billion for its first retail private equity fund, targeting those who have at least $5 million to invest. Separately, BlackRock Inc is buying Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion, a major foray into alternative investments. The acquisition will make it the second-largest manager of private infrastructure assets.After blowing past major milestones — the pair now manages over $1 trillion and $10 trillion, respectively — Blackstone and BlackRock need to show investors they still have a good story to tell. The two deals showcase just that.Not every dollar earned is deemed equal. In private equity, for instance, being able to fund raise and earn management fees has become more valuable than notching superior fund performance.As private equity groups enter 2024 with record a $2.8 trillion in unsold investments, analysts are brushing away potential gains from asset sales. After all, initial public offering markets remain anemic; so do global M&A activities.HSBC Holdings Plc, for one, calls realised capital gains on portfolio exits “low quality,” while praising the “sticky and hence high quality” nature of fee-related earnings. In its sum-of-the-parts analysis, earnings from asset sales get a 25 percent valuation discount, while those from management fees receive a 50 percent premium.Institutional investors are fed up by private equity firms that continue to ask for more money, with few exits in sight. Some sovereign wealth funds and state pension providers have told the managers that they want their money back before committing to upcoming raises. Recently, a few are creating so-called evergreen funds. They are more difficult to manage, but allow investors to redeem more easily.Seen in this light, Blackstone’s dash for mini-millionaires is a no-brainer. They are easy cash cows. The wealthy that Blackstone’s retail PE fund is targeting have only 11 percent to 13 percent of their assets invested in alternatives, versus 26 percent to 28 percent for endowment funds.By the same token, BlackRock may also want more of the “high quality” earnings that Blackstone enjoys. Fees earned by alternative asset managers are more sticky, because their investments have a much longer time horizon than stocks, and investors are mentally prepared to be patient.The revenue-sharing deal that BlackRock struck with GIP, which holds stakes in airports in Sydney and London, is telling. It would receive 100 percent of the management fees, but only 40 percent of the performance fees from future GIP funds. It’s a sign that BlackRock wants the “sticky” earnings.By its own account, BlackRock is seeing dramatic industry shifts. In the core US exchange trade funds space, the iShares ETFs are losing ground to Vanguard and aggressive rivals such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Dimensional Fund Advisors. Meanwhile, price wars are widespread. When BlackRock launched its first Bitcoin ETF in January, it started off at a 0.3 percent annual fee, which was already below analyst expectations, but had to lower to 0.25 percent after smaller peers undercut it.Perhaps this is the peril of an asset manager under the constant scrutiny of public investors. If it was privately held like Vanguard, it would be only responsible to investors in its funds, allowing more focus on delivering returns. But as a publicly listed entity, it has to worry about earnings quality. In the world of Blackstone and BlackRock, raising money is becoming more important than making money for clients. Their ultimate loyalty has to be to their shareholders.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg "

How to invest when the objective is to ensure that the family retains buying power at the same level in the next generation? Read on,"Most of us, when we start investing, it is with a very small corpus, unless we are lucky to have an inherited portfolio. The lure of making a lot of money in the stock market beckons. Reading the exploits of the legends like Warren Buffett or Jim Simons or our very own Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, we dream big. The problem we try to solve for is wealth creation.On the other hand, there is another class of investor, who has a completely different challenge. They have made their money, mostly from their businesses, and have either sold out or taken out a substantial portion to create a sizeable portfolio. And now they wish to invest it. This takes many forms – family offices, family trusts, family portfolios etc.In the last few years, I have been associated with a few large family offices and have gathered a fair understanding of the psychology of this type of investment. The most important aspect in this form of investing is not wealth creation but wealth preservation. Here, the objective is not to look for the next multibagger but to ensure that the family retains buying power at the same level in the next generation.Capital Preservation: Play Defence Before OffenceWhen I was first asked to help guide the investment of one such family a few years back, in the midst of Covid, it gave me a great sense of responsibility. Here the capital is all that the family had. It was irreplaceable. If it was lost, it can never be replaced. It represented a lifetime of effort, earnings and savings of the family. Now that the business was sold, there was going to be no more capital coming in. So, capital preservation had to be the most important factor.Read | Nifty crash: Factors driving the sell off and should investors panic?Question is how to preserve capital? I use multiple ways to manage risk.Risk Management: Modes Of SurvivalFirst and foremost, my focus is buy high quality businesses. Longevity and endurance of a business becomes one of the most important criteria for stock selection. This ensures very low probability of permanent capital loss.Secondly, I use a stop loss. This sounds sacrilegious to many value investors, but I am strongly of the belief that no investor can know all that is to know about any investment. I mean, even promoters don’t know everything. We deal with the future when we invest. And the future is always uncertain. So, I use a stop loss. It is my insurance against catastrophic loss. This provides a floor to the loss I can take at any time and provides a fair deal of comfort to me and the investor family as well.Thirdly, I diversify. Depending on the size of the portfolio, the diversification varies. Usually, I prefer having 10-20 stocks in my portfolio. But for large portfolios I sometimes would have more stocks.Asset Allocation: Spread It OutAnother aspect is to have multiple asset classes in the portfolio. Equity, bonds, gold, silver, real estate are the ones that are good options. As I am personally only focused on equities, I suggest they consult with specialists in each area. Moreover, a broad percent allocation needs to be agreed upon and an annual check is needed to adhere to the allocation.Even within equities diversification across sectors is important. No sector should become too large to hurt the portfolio.Also read | 5 investment tips for 2024, irrespective of where the market isDefensive Factors To The ForeIn factor investing parlance, while constructing a defensive portfolio, the preference should be towards selecting stocks which correspond to factors such as dividend, value, large size etc. Sometimes a combination of such factors could be a good starting point. For example, stocks which are large cap with a good dividend yield could be a good choice. Or stocks which are cheap and offer good dividend yield.Market TimingMarket timing, another topic which is anathema to the investing pundits, is something which everyone wishes to do but admits not to try! As a student of the craft of investing, I always try to get better at the craft. And that includes market timing. In fact, observing markets and participants over the years has taught me that timing is one of the most critical aspects of investing. If you are too early to enter you will get sub-par results. If you are too late to exit a stock, again you will get a sub-par result.Market timing can be attempted in many ways, and none are foolproof. You can use technical or quantitative analysis. You can use absolute or relative valuation based methods.Custom Indexing Or Nifty? When you start playing defence you may be drawn towards a broad index like Nifty and invest passively. Although it is a perfectly good course of action, a much better approach is to build a custom index based on your own preferences.I have used simple quantitative methods to create a customised index which improves upon the vanilla Nifty index by changing the methodology of stock selection, sector weightage and entry and exit criteria.With large portfolios, more fundamental oriented long duration quant models are required to be implemented.Playing OffenceSome amount of playing offence is needed to enhance portfolio returns. When we look at building a portfolio from a factor investing model, offence would mean adding growth and momentum as major factors in the portfolio. Although, commonly, momentum is synonymous with short term trading, it need not be so. Longer term momentum strategies are also extremely effective and can be used in portfolios of large size.In ConclusionOver time and with increased portfolio size, objectives of an investor can change. Kahneman and Tversky introduced the prospect theory, for which Kahneman later received the Nobel Prize. The theory says that investors value gains and losses differently, placing more weight on profits versus losses. That is people are more averse to making losses than gaining. It is said that for every rupee lost, an investor feels double the pain than for a rupee gained. This is more the case when the capital is irreplaceable.History is replete with families who were once mega rich but over generations have not been able to compound their wealth. A strong mix of strategies with defined risk management can help protect and generate wealth over very long periods of time.Abhishek Basumallick is Founder, Intelsense Capital, and Board Advisor – Equities, Shree Rama Managers PMS.

This strategy has four major engines,"" Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw also told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.He listed the four engines as investment in infrastructure,- both physical and digital, lifting up those at the bottom pyramid of the population, boosting manufacturing, and simplifying processes underlying ease of doing business.Foreign investors have bet big on India since Modi came to power in 2014, with the likes of Apple, Samsung, Kia, and Airbus expanding operations.This investment has come despite criticism from some executives who say Modi's protectionist policies in sectors such as digital payments, manufacturing and e-commerce often promote local businesses to the disadvantage of foreign companies.India attracted FDI inflows of $33 billion in the first six months of the current financial year that started in April 2023. It recorded FDI of $71 billion in the 2022-23 financial year.India expects its economy to grow by 7.3% in this financial year, the highest rate of any of the major global economies, but it still has large numbers of unemployed young people - a key issue in the upcoming elections.Vaishnaw compared hitting $100 billion with the inflows China attracted annually over more than a decade, adding investors now see India as the ""most important investment destination"".Vaishnaw has been overseeing India's push to be a powerhouse in electronics manufacturing, a key plank of Modi's business agenda.India is continuously engaging with Apple to boost that company's manufacturing and retail presence in the country, Vaishnaw said. India is currently estimated to account for about 12-14% of global iPhone shipments."

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales gaining 0.4%.","The dollar index hit a fresh one-month high on Wednesday after US retail sales data indicated the economy remained on solid footing, denting the market outlook for any potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.Retail sales rose 0.6% last month after an unrevised 0.3% gain in November, the Commerce Department's Census Bureau said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales gaining 0.4%.While markets still see the Fed's first downward move in rates likely to come in March, expectations for a cut of at least 25 basis points (bps) are down to 57.1%, according to CME's FedWatch Tool, from 65.1% on Tuesday.""If we look at this morning's retail sales report, that points to growth on virtually every possible level and across every aggregate within the consumer spending sphere,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.""That points to underlying inflation pressure remaining sticky for longer, and that coincides with the fact that we're seeing a concerted push from policymakers to anchor market expectations out into the middle of the year for the first cut, and also to warn markets that the cadence of rate cuts is going to be slower than anticipated.""The dollar index which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was up 0.21% at 103.51, after climbing to 103.68, its highest since Dec. 13.The greenback jumped 0.67% jump on Tuesday, it's biggest one-day percentage climb since Jan. 3, driven higher in part by comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who said that, while the US was ""within striking distance"" of the Fed's 2% inflation goal, the central bank should not rush towards cuts in its benchmark interest rate until it was clear lower inflation would be sustained.Also supporting the dollar was data showing China's economy grew 5.2% in 2023, slightly more than the official target, but it was a far shakier recovery than many analysts and investors expected while its property crisis deepened.The dollar touched 148.47 against the rate-sensitive Japanese yen, its highest since Nov. 30, and was last up 0.67% at 148.17. The greenback also hit a two-month high of 7.2321 against China's offshore yuan.The euro was down 0.14% to $1.0859 against the dollar, on the heels of a 0.67% drop in the prior session, even as European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers try to dispel expectations of looming rate cuts.Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot told CNBC on Wednesday that investor bets for ECB rate cuts were excessive and possibly self-defeating because they could actually hold back monetary easing.Sterling was last trading at $1.266, up 0.17% on the day, on track for its first gain against the dollar after three straight sessions of declines, as a rise in British inflation reinforced market expectations that the Bank of England would be slower to cut rates than other central banks.In cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was down 1.27% to $42,584."

Addressing a group of businessmen at Surat, the PM said, “The government has also set targets for the next 25 years. We are working on the target of becoming a $5-10 trillion economy as well as taking exports to a record high.”The Policy Next SummitJayant Sinha, Chairperson of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance and Member of Lok Sabha, will deliver the keynote address on ‘Modinomincs 3.0’ at the Policy Next Summit, followed by a fireside chat with Shweta Punj, Deputy Editor at Moneycontrol.Sinha, an engineering graduate from IIT Delhi, pursued a post-graduate degree in energy management & policy from the University of Pennsylvania in 1986. He later attended Harvard Business School and obtained an MBA with Distinction in 1992. His impactful tenure in India's Council of Ministers (2014-2019) included key roles in passing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and spearheading initiatives at the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Before entering politics, Sinha held pivotal roles in a leading impact investment firm and McKinsey & Company, where he co-led the global Software & IT Services Practice. He is also an acclaimed venture capital expert.Union Minister RK Singh to speak on securing India’s energy futureRaj Kumar Singh, Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy, will deliver a keynote address on securing India’s energy future. The keynote address will be followed by a fireside chat with Nalin Mehta, Managing Editor of Moneycontrol.Raj Kumar Singh is a former Indian bureaucrat and a current Union Cabinet Minister. He is a Member of Parliament from Arrah, Bihar, since May 2014. Singh is a 1975 batch Bihar cadre Indian Administrative Service officer and former Home Secretary of India.In December 2023 the power ministry estimated that India will witness more than 83 percent increase in investments in renewable energy projects to around $16.5 billion in 2024 as the country focuses on energy transition to reduce carbon emissions.Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Singh to discuss how India managed food inflationRohit Kumar Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, will discuss with Moneycontrol’s Shweta Punj how India has managed food inflation. Singh, a 1989-batch IAS officer from the Rajasthan cadre, has served as the Consumer Affairs Secretary since December 31, 2021.He holds an Electrical Engineering degree from IIT, BHU, and a Master's in Computer Engineering from Clarkson University, US. Singh also earned a Master's in Public Administration from Harvard University, where he was recognised as a Lucius N. Littaeur Fellow in 2004.The discussion is timely given the food inflation concerns among policymakers. At the ongoing World Economic Forum (WEF) Summit at Davos, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das noted that food inflation is on top of the central bank's agenda. He said, “One area which is on top of our agenda at the moment is dynamics of food inflation… Food inflation can be very volatile, depending on some weather events.” India's retail inflation rate accelerated to a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December, according to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on January 12, owing to an unfavourable base effect. However, India has so far seen reasonable success in battling food inflation.Macro story, interim Budget and beyondWith the interim Budget on February 1, the first panel discussion at the Policy Next summit will be on ‘Macro story, interim Budget and beyond’. The session will see experts discuss expectations from the upcoming interim Budget, macroeconomic outlook among other things.Aditi Nayar, Chief Economist at ICRA Ltd, Devendra Kumar Pant Chief Economist at India Ratings and Research, Dr Ashwani Mahajan, National Co-Convener at Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Subhash Chandra Garg, Former Finance Secretary, GOI will be the speakers at the panel discussion.

Asked about any adverse impact on imports due to problems in Red sea, the minister asserted ""there is no shortage of fertilisers in the country"".Addressing a press conference, chemicals and fertilizers minister Mansukh Mandaviya highlighted that the urea imports are estimated at 40-50 lakh tonnes this fiscal, lower from around 75 lakh tonnes imported in the previous year, helped by higher domestic production and increased use of nano liquid urea. ""Ministry of External Affairs is making necessary interventions and our Navy is giving protection to Indian cargo vessels,"" Mandaviya told reporters.According to exporters, freight rates have skyrocketed by up to 600 per cent due to the Red Sea crisis which would hurt the world trade. The geopolitical tension around the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial shipping route connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, has escalated due to recent attacks by Yemen-based Houthi militants.The minister also spoke about his new book 'FERTILISING THE FUTURE: Bharat's March Towards Fertiliser Self-Sufficiency'. Mandaviya said there is sufficient availability of fertilisers in the country to meet the requirements of the kharif (summer sown) season.At present, the country has stocks of 70 lakh tonnes of urea, 20 lakh tonnes of DAP, 10 lakh tonnes of MoP (Muriate of Potash), 40 lakh tonnes of NPK and 20 lakh tonnes of SSP (single super phosphate). Mandaviya highlighted that the government has taken several steps since 2014 to boost domestic production of fertilisers and reduce import dependence.He said four urea plants have already been revived and the fifth one would also start production soon. The minister said the Centre is also promoting alternate fertilisers line — nano liquid urea and nano liquid DAP. Besides, it has launched a scheme to incentivise states that curb use of chemical fertilisers.India has entered into long-term supply agreements with global suppliers for assured imports of fertilisers and its raw materials at pre-determined prices, he added. Asked about fertiliser subsidy, Mandaviya said the subsidy bill is estimated at around Rs 1.7-1.8 lakh crore.""Subsidy is expected to be lower this year because of fall in global prices. We have not increased retail prices to reduce subsidy,"" he said. When the global rates skyrocketed during last fiscal, he said, the government increased subsidy and kept the retail prices of urea, di ammonium phosphate (DAP) and other fertilisers to protect farmers interest."

He stressed that the issue of Houthi rebels attacking Red Sea should be ‘speedily addressed’,"Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis, who were the latest to join the Israel-Hamas war, have been attacking ships, which are either Israel owned or heading to Israeli ports, in the Red Sea, leading to a direct confrontation with the US, whose cargo ship was destroyed by the rebel group in the Gulf of Aden on Monday.The Red Sea connects the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean by Suez Canal.When News18 spoke with external affairs minister S Jaishankar about the issue at large and why were the vessels being targeted by the Houthis, he said, “We have multiple phenomena out there… we had piracy, resurfacing of piracy. That’s a different problem. The drone strikes and missile strikes are different problems… so both factors are important but the second one is more. It (the issue) has started to divert shipping and that has its cost”. He further said such attacks would impact India’s energy and economic interests. He stressed that the issue should be “speedily addressed”.Several shipping lines have announced that they are diverting round the Cape of Good Hope to reach Europe after Houthis are hitting vessels in the Red Sea. The latest one was the Greek-owned bulk carrier Zograflia from Vietnam to Israel, which was struck by Houthis on January 17.Jaishankar, who was on an official visit to Iran, met President Ebrahim Raisi on January 16 regarding speeding up the implementation of bilateral agreements, including the Chabahar Port Development Plan.Raisi highlighted importance of Iran-India ties, but raised concerns regarding Israel’s counter offensive in Gaza, and urged India to help in ending the bombings.“The President described the crimes committed by Zionist regime in Gaza as clear examples of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and clarified stopping the attacks on Gaza, punishing the Zionist regime and fulfilling the rights of Palestinian people is the only way to return stability and security to the region. It is important for India to play a role in ending the bombings, lifting the blockade of this region and realising the rights of the Palestinian people,” Raisi’s statement said.According to The Wall Street Journal, British oil giant Shell on Tuesday announced suspending all of its shipment through the Red Sea infinitely.US and British warplanes, ships and submarines last week launched dozens of air strikes across Yemen in retaliation to Houthi attack on Red Sea shipping, which the Iran-backed movement considers as a response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza."

These guarantees are usually given when the default risk is too high for lenders.The working group's formation was decided in July 2022 at the 32nd Conference of state finance secretaries. The group comprised officials from Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka from the states' side and officials from the Union finance ministry, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, and the RBI.The recommendations come amid increasing discussions on the financial situation of states, with the decision of some governments to revert to the Old Pension Scheme seen as a big step back in improving their finances.In its report, the working group said that if guarantees have to be paid out and there are not sufficient buffers, it could result in higher expenditure, deficit, and debt levels for states.As at the end of 2020-21, guarantees given by states amounted to Rs 7.4 lakh crore, or 3.7 percent of the GDP. Meanwhile, the Guarantee Redemption Fund stood at Rs 10,839 crore as on March 31, 2023.""Another related concern associated with the guarantees extended by the states, has been the increasing bank finance to government owned entities backed by government guarantee, especially, where the bank finance appeared to substitute budgetary resources of the state governments,"" the report said.Outstanding guarantees amounted to under 10 percent of the Gross State Domestic Product for most states, though the percentage has been rising, data contained in the report shows. And while some states have fixed ceilings – some statutory, some administrative – on the amount of guarantees they can give out, they lack uniformity. Source: Report of Working Group on State Government GuaranteesSome of the other recommendations of the working group are:>> There should not be any distinction between conditional and unconditional or financial and performance guarantees when it comes to assessing the fiscal risk.>> Guarantees should include all instruments that create an obligation for the state.>> Government guarantees should not be provided to the private sector.>> Government guarantees should not be used to obtain finance through state-owned entities, which substitutes budgetary resources of the state government.>> Any guarantee, once given, must be honoured without delay. Otherwise, it could hurt the reputation of the state and create a legal risk."

No-one is looking at that"", Puri told Reuters in an interview at this week's World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, referring to attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea.","Supply cuts by OPEC+, costly shipments from some traditional Middle East suppliers and geopolitical tension is driving India, the world's third biggest oil importer, to diversify its crude sources and accelerate its energy transition, its Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said.""Whenever there is vulnerability and uncertainty in the market, the transition gets accelerated. No-one is looking at that"", Puri told Reuters in an interview at this week's World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, referring to attacks by the Houthis on ships in the Red Sea.Puri said that while OPEC+ nations have a right to decide on their energy production, supply cuts against such uncertainty, and the resulting adverse impact on global prices, will dent long term demand.It is ""imperative"" for India to accelerate its transition to green energy in this scenario, he added.Iraq followed Saudi Arabia in charging a premium for oil supplies to Asian markets which made their crude ""more expensive than crude sourced elsewhere"", the minister said, noting India is now buying from 37 countries up from 29 earlier.Saudi Aramco, the national oil giant, this month cut the price of its flagship Arab Light crude to Asian customers to the lowest level in 27 months.""I didn't tell them to reduce it but they did it because they also wanted to. If you look at the Indian figures in the last 2-4 years, some of the major suppliers suddenly became number three and somebody who had only 0.2% (import share) went up,"" Puri added.Iraq replaced Saudi Arabia as the top oil supplier to India a few years ago and now cheaper supply from Russia in the aftermath of Western sanctions for its invasion of Ukraine has pushed it to the top spot followed by Iraq and Saudi Arabia.While concerned over the disruptions in the Red Sea, Puri said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that they will be resolved.Puri said he had just signed a memorandum of understanding with Guyana to cooperate across the entire energy value chain of the South American country.He is also talking to companies in Davos who are interested in making investments in India and with whom he would like Indian oil companies to partner with to explore acquisitions and assets in regions such as Latin America.Puri said countries, including in the Middle East, had told him they want to acquire Indian oil companies outright, he said, but they are strategic and not for sale."

Banking stocks, particularly those in the private sector, are the worst affected. This downturn can be largely attributed to HDFC Bank's disappointing results announced on Tuesday.The Indian markets seem to be following a trend observed in the US market, which fell by nearly 0.6 percent after Morgan Stanley reported poor financial figures, and Apple declared an unusual discount in the Chinese market due to competitive pressures.While today's decline has various contributing factors, Indian markets have exhibited structural weakness over the past two weeks. This concern was highlighted in our weekly market outlook columns here and here.Several technical indicators displayed a negative divergence, where the market reached new highs while internal factors weakened. Only a handful of stocks were aligning with the market's direction. Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) maintained significantly high positions in the derivative market without booking profits, signalling an imminent market fall when they decide to sell.The build-up to the current decline has been unfolding over the past few weeks, and there are multiple reasons behind the market's structural weakness. With a general election scheduled for May, traders have begun withdrawing funds in anticipation of a rally that has been ongoing since mid-October 2023.Internationally, various developments suggest challenging times ahead. The recent incident in the Red Sea involving Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen firing at sea vessels has raised tensions. Despite the presence of US and UK naval forces, the rebels persist. Iran, seeking attention, has initiated attacks in Syria, Iraq, and Pakistan, drawing global focus to Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.As the conflict intensifies, neighbouring countries supporting Palestine may feel compelled to act, attacking random targets to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinians. The Middle East is rapidly becoming a potential war zone, creating apprehension in the market. Any excuse, including poor financial performance, is being used as a reason to exit.With logistical costs expected to rise due to the Red Sea attacks and energy prices increasing, there is a possibility that anticipated interest rate reductions by various central banks may be postponed. Given these circumstances, it is logical for traders to lighten their positions in equity markets. The surprising element is that most of them decided to do it on the same day.Investing insights from our research teamHDFC Bank – Deposit growth holds the key to stock re-ratingFederal Bank Q3 FY24 – Valuation remains a drawMapmyIndia: Growth at an unreasonable priceTrackerPro Economic Tracker | Power consumption improves, labour participation mutedWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Tax evasion via auction, FACT and fiction, HNIs see bright side of Polycab fiascoIPO euphoria extends to rights issuesBudget Snapshot: STT collection overshoots estimatesUnion Budget 2024: What the markets want beyond electionsCopper smelters face a difficult year in 2024What lies beyond the 4.5 percent fiscal deficit goal?Budget 2024 : Slowdown in road project awards could hurt developers What we really know about the global economy (republished from the FT)Brother vs Sister battle in Andhra Pradesh could end up benefiting Chandrababu NaiduUnion Budget 2024: What the poor, youth, farmers and women will look forIndia’s growth needs to be powered by greater consumptionIt’s time to scrap the Iowa CaucusMusk’s threat to Tesla is countered by realityChatGPT may rival Flash Boys in transforming marketsPersonal FinanceIs Kenneth Andrade's Old Bridge Fund NFO a ticket to high returns or a risky ride?

That is 10% higher than a projected outlay of nearly 2 trillion rupees ($24.11 billion) for the current 2023-24 fiscal year.Additionally, next fiscal year's fertiliser subsidy is expected to be 1.75 trillion rupees ($21.10 billion), down from the current 2022-23 fiscal year estimate of nearly 2 trillion rupees, one of the sources said.The sources, which are directly involved in the decision making on the subsidies, did not wish to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will unveil the 2024/25 budget on Feb. 1.The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution ministries of finance did not reply to requests for comment.Maintaining the combined subsidies at their current level would be unusual for a government facing a national election in just a few months, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi is widely expected to win a rare third term in elections scheduled for April and May.Also, containing food and fertiliser subsidies is crucial for managing India's fiscal deficit, which Modi's government is targeting at 5.9% of gross domestic product this year and planning to lower by at least 50 basis points in the fiscal year 2024/25.The food subsidy bill is likely to go up next year as Modi's administration late last year extended its flagship free food welfare programme for the next five years.India runs its multi-billion dollar food welfare programme, the world's biggest such initiative, by buying rice and wheat from millions of domestic farmers at state-set minimum or guaranteed prices and then supplying the staples for free to 800 million Indians."
231,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/indias-10-trillion-run-the-first-milestone-on-the-developed-economy-road-12062431.html,India's $10 trillion run – the first milestone on the developed economy road,"January 17, 2024 09:34 AM IST","India is hoping to become a developed country by 2047. While that finish line is almost a quarter of a century away, there are milestones to be crossed along the way. And if these milestones, such as increasing the GDP to $10 trillion, are reached, the eventual objective may not be as distant as it looks.","That the Indian economy is a bright spot in an uncertain world has been widely said for the better part of a decade. While the COVID-19 pandemic caused the economy to contract in 2020-21, a fairly quick turnaround followed, with the latest GDP numbers — quarterly and annual — surprising on the upside and forcing economists to significantly raise their forecasts.But while the present is bright, it is the future that matters. And the Indian government is aiming for the stars with its target of making the country a developed economy by 2047 to coincide with the hundredth anniversary of India's independence from British rule.Also Read: A $30-trillion Indian economy by 2047 a conservative target, says FM SitharamanTo be sure, there is no precise definition of what constitutes a developed economy. Even the range of annual per capita income — the most commonly cited metric to determine what stage an economy is at — is rather wide and can be anywhere from $15,000 to $30,000. What is clear is that increasing the current per capita income level of around $2,500 will require broad economic and social reforms across sectors and deft management from the government.Size of the taskIndia's growth rate may be surprising on the upside, but that is in real terms. Nominal growth, or growth without adjusting for inflation, has been lower than expected, with the statistics ministry estimating India's gross domestic product (GDP) to have grown by only 8.9 percent in 2023-24 in current rupee price terms. This is lower than the 10.5 percent the finance ministry had assumed in the budget.A simple extrapolation of the nominal GDP at a growth rate of 11 percent reveals that even if the Indian rupee does not depreciate at all against the US dollar from hereon, it may take until 2034 for the size of the economy to rise to $10 trillion. But if growth continues at the same rate of 11 percent, the GDP may indeed hit $40 trillion in 2047.But the exchange rate will be the big spanner in the works here. If one assumes a steady 1 percent per-year depreciation of the rupee, the math could be upended. This is where the reforms come in.Budget and beyondThe 2024-25 budget may only be an interim one, but it, along with the new government's full budget that will be presented in July after the Lok Sabha elections, will lay the groundwork for the near future.""With the upcoming Union Budget for 2024-25 set to be an interim one for the purpose of a vote-on-account, major policy changes and announcements are unlikely. However, the expansion in the Government of India's capex and the extent of fiscal consolidation would be scrutinised closely,"" economists from ratings agency ICRA said.The Centre has spent heavily on capital expenditure in recent years to drive growth and crowd in the private sector. And while another record capex target will likely be set, up from Rs 10 lakh crore in 2023-24, fiscal constraints and the beginnings of the private capex cycle mean the government may have to go easy on the pedal.The central government has a medium-term fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26. The target for 2024-25 could be set at around 5.3 percent, down from 5.9 percent this year. Later this week, on January 18, economists can be expected to shed some more light on this matter at Moneycontrol's Policy Next summit.Reforming the tax systemThe key to the government's ability to raise spending going forward is how much tax it collects. And while the interim budget is unlikely to make any meaningful changes when it comes to direct taxes, the indirect tax regime offers plenty of opportunity for change.Also Read: GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicatedThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) system was introduced in July 2017. Monthly GST collections have steadily increased over the years, with this year's average at Rs 1.66 lakh crore, up from Rs 1.51 lakh crore in 2022-23.However, GST is far from complete and needs substantial work – from reducing the number of tax slabs to widening its scope to include key items such as fuel products, among others. The Moneycontrol Policy Next summit will also see a panel discussion where indirect tax experts and former high-ranking bureaucrats debate what should be done next to reform the GST.Food and energy securityWhile raising per capita income is crucial to becoming a developed nation, it will count for little if the prices of mass consumption items spiral out of control. Since 2022, food prices have surged due to the disruptions caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the unseasonal and uneven rainfall hurting domestic agricultural production.The government, to give it its due, has taken a raft of steps to bring down prices of cereals, pulses, edible oils, and key vegetables such as onion and tomato. Elaborating on this at this week's Policy Next summit will be Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Kumar Singh.The other key mass consumption item that puts pressure on household pockets is fuel, with prices of petrol and diesel unchanged for more than a year now. The energy sector, however, is going through a huge change as the world continues to push towards renewable sources. For India, power is crucial, with Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran saying on more than one occasion that energy security could be the biggest challenge to India's future growth prospects.Fittingly, the Policy Next summit will have RK Singh, Union Minister for Power, New, and Renewable Energy, deliver the keynote address on securing India’s energy future.The age of womenAction on food and fuel prices and other reforms will count for little in India's pursuit of first becoming a $10 trillion economy and then a developed one if it does not manage to bring half its population on par with the other.""India has aspirations to become a high-income country by 2047… In order to get to high-income country (levels), it needs to grow closer to 8 percent. And you can't get there if a large part of your workforce — females — is not participating,"" World Bank Senior Economist Dhruv Sharma had said in October 2023 at the release of the Bank's India Development Update report.As part of this effort, the January 18 Policy Next summit will see women leaders from different spheres — law, politics, business, and economics — debate how women can truly become India's next growth engine."

He called for tighter multilateral coordination of macroeconomic policy, international cooperation on green development and better North-South cooperation.Li also offered an optimistic prognosis for China's macroeconomic health and assurances on pro-business policies to multinational companies. Addressing the theme of 'Rebuilding Trust' of the WEF annual meeting, Li listed five proposals to address the trust deficit in the global macroeconomy.These included better international coordination of macroeconomic policy; more industrial specialization among countries in order to stabilize supply chains; more open international exchange of scientific and technological know-how; enhanced international collaboration on green development and addressing climate change; and better North-South cooperation. Premier Li said the theme, rebuilding trust, of this meeting echoes with people's concerns.""It was trust that paved the way for economic development over the past decade. The foundation of trust has eroded and lack of trust is coming in the way of global development. ""It is essential that we discard prejudices and work towards removing trust deficit,"" he said.On China's recent economic performance, Li said that the country's contribution to global growth has remained steady at about 30 per cent, and that its scientific and technological talent pool remains the world's largest. ""Looking at the broader picture, we are now advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development,"" Li said.""Delivering modernization to more than 1.4 billion people will be a remarkable achievement in human history, one that will provide continuous impetus to the development of China and the wider world,"" he added. The size of China's middle class, already at 400 million, will continue to swell to 800 million over the coming decade, Li said, and urbanization rates remain 10 per cent lower than in developed countries, indicating that migration to cities will continue apace, creating market opportunities as newly urban households upgrade their consumption.""All this will create massive demand in areas such as housing, education, medical services and elderly care,"" he said. Li noted China's contributions towards decarbonization, citing that over half of the world's new energy vehicles run on roads in China.""The new energy vehicle ownership rate reached 20 million by the end of last year, and China contributes one-fourth of the increased area of afforestation in the world,"" he said. He also reaffirmed China's commitment to further opening its economy, sharing these market opportunities with the world and ensuring a business-friendly environment for international cooperation.""We embrace investments from businesses of all countries with open arms and will continue to work tirelessly to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment that we will steadily expand,"" Li said."

Considering these factors, EEPC maintains a cautious optimism and hopes that geo-political tension will ease, leading to an improvement in the global macroeconomic situation, Garodia said.While overall demand remains strong, the Red Sea conflict is a significant issue, causing delays due to increased transit times and additional freight costs, he said. EEPC believes that entering into more free trade agreements, especially with countries in Latin America and Africa, would provide exporters with deeper access to new and emerging markets, he said.As the Union Budget is around the corner, the government could take measures such as providing low-cost credit and market support to boost engineering exports, EEPC said in a statement."

In a blog post for the World Economic Forum (WEF), the head of apples-to-airport Adani Group said leapfrogging to renewables and green hydrogen will help India achieve energy security and improve air quality in cities.Green hydrogen produced by splitting water using renewable electricity is a clean fuel with no carbon emissions. It can be used as a feedstock in industries like steel and oil refineries and as fuel in automobiles and produces water on being burnt. ""Renewable energy has come a long way but relies on the right weather conditions; green hydrogen could be a viable alternative to fossil fuels,"" Adani said.Green hydrogen relies on renewable energy. And so the production cost of renewable energy must fall faster than green hydrogen's to be viable. Vertical integration, where a company takes on all upstream and downstream activities associated with its main offering, could significantly reduce green hydrogen production costs, he said.""Green hydrogen may be the last mile in the net-zero journey for many sectors, especially in India,"" he said. However, its current cost is high and needs to be brought down.""For India, the equitable solution is not to replace one fossil fuel with another but to leapfrog to renewables and green hydrogen,"" he said. ""The decrease in solar costs can be replicated in green hydrogen."" The cost of electricity generated from solar panels in 2011 was Rs 15 per kilowatt-hour (or per unit), which has now fallen to Rs 1.99 per unit – the lowest in the world."

There is some wind coming from 2023 into 2024.”IMF chief’s sentiment was echoed by her colleague, First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath, who told a Davos panel that the chances of a so-called soft landing have gone up “quite a bit” and that market expectations for rapid interest-rate cuts are “a bit premature.”Economic realities have shifted since the IMF’s October forecast growth of 2.9% for this year. While inflation could recede without throwing major economies into a recession, a drawn-out Israel-Hamas war and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea are threatening new price pressures and supply-chain woes.Georgieva spoke hours after Donald Trump clinched victory in Iowa while seeking the Republican candidacy. Asked if she agrees with her IMF predecessor, Christine Lagarde, that another Trump presidency could be a threat, Georgieva said it’s for Americans to choose their leader — and the fund will focus on policies the winner will ultimately implement.Turning to China, she urged Xi Jinping’s administration to continue opening up state-owned enterprises, addressing local government-debt issues and sorting out its real estate sector to ensure the economy won’t fall into a low-growth trap.“China recognizes that unless they move forward with difficult structural reforms they will see growth dipping under 4%,” Georgieva said, adding that she’s seeing a “a very strong determination to stay engaged internationally.”The world’s second-biggest economy grew around 5.2% in 2023, surpassing the government’s official growth target for the year without relying on “massive stimulus,” Chinese Premier Li Qiang said in Davos on Tuesday — one day before official figures for gross domestic product, industrial production and retail sales are due.For 2024, Beijing is widely expected to set a growth target at around 5% again.Georgieva is scheduled to meet Argentine President Javier Milei on Wednesday in Davos. Asked about results under his new government, she said “so far so good.”“What this administration is doing is to very aggressively address some of the shortcomings we all see,” Georgieva said. “Fiscal: out of whack — you spend more than you can afford. Reserves: wiped out. So we are seeing progress on all those fronts.”The IMF gave Milei’s economic plans a key vote of confidence on Jan. 10, approving a review of the country’s $44 billion program that will likely unlock a larger-than-expected loan disbursement of $4.7 billion for the South American nation, pending board approval.The IMF cares “deeply” that Argentina protects its most vulnerable people as it moves forward with “very bold reforms,” Georgieva said."

The report, Quantifying the Impact of Climate Change on Human Health, developed in collaboration with Oliver Wyman, was released at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024.It analysed the climate crisis through a new lens by providing a detailed picture of the indirect impact climate change will have on human health, the global economy and healthcare systems around the world. ""While there has been much discussion about the impact of climate change on nature and the global economy, some of the most pressing consequences of the Earth's rising temperatures will be on human health and the global healthcare system,"" said Shyam Bishen, Head of the Centre for Health and Healthcare and Member of the Executive Committee at the WEF.""Recent progress will be lost unless critical emission reduction and mitigation measures are improved, and decisive global action is taken to build climate resilient and adaptable health systems,"" he added. The analysis is based on scenarios developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the most likely trajectory for the planet's rising average temperature, 2.5 degrees to 2.9 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.The report analysed six major climate-driven event categories as key multi-pronged drivers of negative health impacts -- floods, droughts, heat waves, tropical storms, wildfires and rising sea levels. Floods were found to pose the highest acute risk of climate-induced mortality, accounting for 8.5 million deaths by 2050.Droughts, indirectly linked to extreme heat, are the second-highest cause of mortality, with an anticipated 3.2 million deaths. Heat waves take the highest economic toll at an estimated USD 7.1 trillion by 2050 due to the loss in productivity.Excess deaths attributed to air pollution, caused by fine particulate and ozone pollution, are expected to be the largest contributor to premature death, with almost 9 million deaths a year. Climate change will also trigger a catastrophic rise across several climate-sensitive disease outcomes, including vector-borne disease, which will likely impact previously less affected regions, such as Europe and the United States, the WEF said.By 2050, an additional 500 million people may be at risk of exposure to vector-borne diseases, the report finds. ""The climate crisis is a health crisis, and it is driving a vicious cycle of disease, economic devastation and suffering. It is clear from this report that we are still to understand the full impact,"" said Vanessa Kerry, CEO of Seed Global Health and WHO Special Envoy for Climate Change and Health.""If we fail to act, not only will the death toll be staggering, but we also risk losing progress made over decades to improve health outcomes around the world. Countries least able to afford these shocks and who contribute the least to global emissions will be impacted the most,"" she added. The report warned that climate change will further entrench global health inequities, with the most vulnerable populations, including women, youth, elderly, lower-income groups and hard-to-reach communities, the most affected.Regions like Africa and southern Asia face heightened vulnerability to climate change impacts exacerbated by existing resource limitations, adequate infrastructure and essential medical equipment, further complicating their ability to address and adapt to environmental challenges, it added."

For India’s bond market, 2023 was a bumper year that witnessed $7.2 billion worth of inflows, the highest in six years. This year, foreign investors can’t wait to get their hands on Indian government bonds.Already a billion dollars has flowed into bonds in the first two weeks with a promise of more. And why not? The stars have aligned for India’s bond market with domestic inflation expected to ease and trigger rate cuts. The December inflation print at 5.69 percent did not surprise analysts, but the deceleration in core inflation did. Core inflation is demand-driven and hence of utmost importance to monetary policy. Long story short, the Reserve Bank of India will find less reasons to resist rate cuts as we chug along this year.Then there is the US Federal Reserve, expected to begin cutting rates by June. These expectations, fanned since mid-last year, resulted in record inflows into bond exchange traded funds last year. “Stock funds sucked in a net $640 billion, below the $1 trillion of 2021, but fixed income ETFs vacuumed up a record $332 billion, surpassing the previous zenith of $282 billion in 2021,” states this Financial Times article. The inclusion of Indian bonds in global indices could not have come at a better time.An estimated $40 billion which translates into a cool Rs 3.5-4 lakh crore in today’s exchange rate will flow into Indian bonds as they join other emerging market peers in the JP Morgan bond index in June. Bloomberg, another index host, will also include Indian bonds and add to these flows. The inclusion is an acknowledgement of foreign investor interest in one of the fastest growing economies of the world that carries the badge of an alternative to China now.Indeed, the bond market is becoming a force to reckon with as this Bloomberg column highlights. At least $1 trillion worth of bonds change hands daily, the column points out. Despite two wars that drove up commodity prices globally, a series of rate hikes by the US Fed and a hawkish domestic central bank, India’s government bond yields hardly budged last year. This has given the conviction to bond investors that this year would be better. When the market refuses to balk at every possible headwind, there is no reason for it to not thrive when the winds are with it.One big moving piece is the fiscal policy, that will be put to test next month. In an election year, budgets are tricky, but the government has given assurance that fiscal prudence will be priority. That means the Centre won’t choke the markets with bond supply.Of course, there will be some pruning of expenditure and our column here details how the government can balance growth with spending cuts.The bond market is buying the fiscal story so far. Bond desks are working with a government borrowing of Rs 15 lakh crore for FY25. In the face of the surge in demand from domestic long-term investors and foreign investors, the supply pile looks easy to absorb.2024 could indeed be a Goldilocks year for India’s bond market with both monetary and fiscal policy in a friendly phase. We ask the question whether India’s bonds will best their 2023 show this year? in our column.The answer is yes since Goldilocks is buying.Investing insights from our research teamDiscovery Series: New capacity, R&D uptrend to kickstart new earnings cycle for this healthcare proxyCan election, interim budget revive spend on consumption?Jio Financial’s focus shifts to secured lendingFedbank Financial – a play on steady earningsWhat else are we reading?Budget Snapshot | Indirect taxes push up India’s tax to GDP ratioBudget 2024: Competing fiscal choices may see capex allocations taper in FY2025Why the VIX is not a great indicator for a savvy traderWill the consecration of the Ram Mandir shrink the opposition space further?Has the war risk over Taiwan abated post its election?A warning shot over the last mile in the inflation battle (republished from the FT)Sachin Deepfake: Rethink India’s approach to combating this menaceEVs are cheaper than ever.

RIL needs a 21 percent long-term profit growth, while Bajaj Finance must sustain a 35-40 percent growth to reach the $1-trillion market cap, assuming no P/E re-rating.ICICI Securities projects a $1-trillion market cap for the stock by 2032, with assumptions of a sustained largest stock’s mcap to aggregate mcap ratio of 5.8 percent, a PAT to GDP ratio of 7 percent, and real GDP growth progressing from 7 percent in FY24 to the previous cycle’s peak of 9 percent.No market valuation expansion is assumed, but a faster-than-GDP corporate profit expansion could lead to Mcap/GDP reaching 160 percent without P/E expansion. GDP growth is expected to be driven by capex, re-leveraging, discretionary consumption, and productivity gains from significant strides in digitalisation, it said.The largest stock’s mcap was $10 billion in 2001, soaring to $100 billion by 2007 amid a bullish market driven by a substantial rise in the corporate profit cycle, reflected in a record PAT-GDP ratio of 7 percent. This led to an all-time high mcap to GDP ratio of 160 percent.Despite a high peak P/E ratio of 21x in 2007, it wasn't excessively high, highlighting the deceptive nature of point-in-time P/E ratios and the foundational significance of CAPE ratio (cyclically adjusted P/E ratio). The CAPE during the 2007 peak was an extraordinary 35x compared to a point-in-time forward P/E of 20x, the report added.There are only six firms with $1 trillion market cap.

254,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/why-germany-is-rich-but-germans-are-poor-and-angry-12059541.html,Why Germany is rich but Germans are poor and angry,"January 16, 2024 12:07 PM IST","The top 10% of households have at least €725,000 ($793,000) of net assets and control more than half of the country’s wealth. Helping more people share in the benefits of economic prosperity would go a long way toward neutering support for radical political parties and cooling the anger now boiling over in Germany","For much of its postwar history, Germany was a beacon of prosperity and political stability. Now its economy is stagnating, and social harmony has given way to acrimony and division.Germany’s grossly unequal distribution of wealth is an underappreciated cause of this malaise: The top 10% of households have at least €725,000 ($793,000) of net assets and control more than half of the country’s wealth, while the bottom 40% of households have at most €44,000 of net assets, according to a Bundesbank survey in 2021.Together with a pervasive sense that Germany is coming unstuck — think creaking infrastructure, inflation and the loss of cheap Russian gas — economic precarity makes Germans susceptible to fringe arguments that their living standards are threatened and the government is out of touch. In the long term, Europe’s biggest economy must reform its labor-penalizing tax system and promote a broader distribution of capital.Irate farmers have blocked roads nationwide in recent days, ostensibly to protest agricultural subsidy cuts. They have been joined by supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) who blame the country’s welcome of migrants for its fiscal and economic woes. Almost one-quarter of the population say they would vote AfD if an election were held today – and depressingly, I don’t rule out that figure increasing before next year’s national vote.The federal government is in disarray, having been forced last month to find €17 billion of savings in this year’s budget following a constitutional court ruling that its attempt to repurpose unused pandemic funds for climate investments was illegal.Reconciling the Free Democrats’ anti-borrowing philosophy with the Social Democrats’ commitment to welfare spending and the Greens’ determination to promote decarbonization has led to bickering and compromises that satisfy almost nobody.Gallows bearing the traffic-light symbol of the three-party coalition have appeared at roadsides, and Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, was blocked from leaving a ferry by an angry crowd.Echoing the vituperation of Trump supporters and France’s yellow vests, and fanned by similar social media echo chambers and suspicion of mainstream media, this polarization is nevertheless shocking for a country that prides itself on cohesion and shared prosperity.But the shared prosperity bit is partly a myth: Inequality is high by European standards and median net wealth of around €106,000 is well below the euro-area median of around €150,000.Of course, there’s an argument that Germans don’t need a lot of money to live comfortably due to high-quality public services: Child daycare is free in some federal states, as is public university tuition. Lately, labor unions have won pay hikes, while savers have earned higher interest on bank deposits; farmers too have earned higher profits.However, fewer than half of households own a home and hence haven’t benefited from soaring property prices — the median wealth of German tenant households is just €16,000, according to the Bundesbank.Meanwhile, only around one in six Germans invest in the stock market. In 2019, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who was then finance minister,revealed he kept all his money in a low-yielding bank account. Although his admission may have won the sympathy of Germany’s cautious savers, it spoke volumes about the country’s self-defeating attitude toward investing.Much of Germany’s wealth is held by private, family-owned small and medium-sized companies known as the Mittelstand. These are an engine of job creation, but their thrift underpins the current account surpluses Germany is often criticized for, contributing to inequality andsuppressing domestic consumption, according to the International Monetary Fund.For a long time Germany’s booming exports and budget surpluses deflected from these shortcomings, but the weaknesses of its economic model have now become apparent. Output contracted by 0.3% in 2023, according to an official estimate published on Monday, and the economy might expand by just 0.3% this year, say economists surveyed by Bloomberg.An aging population is also straining Germany’s generous social insurance system. Unless reformed, the proportion of the government budget spent on pensions could rise to more than half by 2050, compared with around one-quarter today.Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s plan to augment the pay-as-you-go pension system with a debt-funded German sovereign wealth fund invested in global equities isn’t sufficient to close the financing gap.Germany’s increasingly fractious politics make me unoptimistic about the chances of further reform to reduce inequality and broaden asset ownership, but there’s no shortage of good ideas.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and leading German economists have long criticized the country’s tax system because the burden is skewed too much toward wages, while property and inheritance taxes are low.There are sweeping inheritance tax exemptions for business owners, for example, on the grounds that jobs and investment might otherwise be endangered. These rules are far too cushy, and the upshot is taxes on large inheritances are often lower than a smaller bequest.Broadening wealth need not mean taking it from the rich. Germans lack tax-efficient ways to invest in the stock market — there isn’t an equivalent of the UK’s individual savings accounts (ISAs) or US 401ks and Roth IRAs, for example.I’m also in favor of a citizen’s inheritance — a cash distribution of, say, €20,000 to every young adult that could be reserved for specific expenseslike acquiring property or paying for education. Not surprisingly, AfD politicians oppose the idea, because it might mean giving even more money to migrant children.An irony of the AfD’s increasing support is that many of its low-income supporters would benefit little from its program, which includes opposing property, wealth and inheritance taxes. Helping more people share in the benefits of economic prosperity would go a long way toward neutering support for radical political parties and cooling the anger now boiling over in Germany.Chris Bryant is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

While the central bank seems to have eased a bit on its intervention lately — the rupee has turned into Asia’s top performer so far this month — limiting the swings in the currency may continue to be a prime focus.“The Reserve Bank of India will let the rupee appreciate only gradually,” said Dhiraj Nim, economist and forex strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. “The RBI of late is allowing for a wider band, but volatility may remain contained at least relative to other currency pairs in the region.”ANZ expects the rupee at 82.50 to a dollar by December, while Credit Agricole CIB is more bullish at 81. The projected gain, while modest from 2023’s close of 83.21, would still be the first appreciation versus the greenback in seven years.India is expected to see a pick up in foreign direct and portfolio investment as well as offshore borrowings, led by easing in global financial conditions and robust economic growth, according to Gaura Sen Gupta, an economist at IDFC FIRST Bank Ltd.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates overseas portfolio flows at $33 billion in 2024, up from $30 billion last year. Foreign direct investment may almost double to $36 billion, from an estimated $19 billion in 2023, the bank said in a recent note.The nation’s trade gap narrowed for a second straight month in December, leading economists to expect a narrower current account deficit in a boost to the currency. Emkay Global Financial Services expects the deficit to narrow to 1.2% of GDP this fiscal year from 1.4% previously.Yet, the monetary authority will have the last say.The RBI has been among the most active among central banks in the forex market, as it continues to build reserves and tamp down rupee volatility.Forex ReservesWhile the approach has helped foreign-currency reserves climb back to $617 billion after falling to a two-year low in 2022, the International Monetary Fund last month said the RBI’s intervention was excessive.Governor Shaktikanta Das has been vocal about the need for emerging markets to bolster their reserves to deal with potential spillover risks. Last week, he pushed back against the IMF’s reclassification of India’s exchange-rate regime.“Some people read it wrongly and call it a stabilized arrangement. But it is not justified, it is market determined,” Das said.“The RBI is unlikely to be influenced by IMF’s reclassification,” Citibank economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar Zaidi wrote in a note. “It will be interesting to see whether the RBI allows a little more intraday/intra month variability without sacrificing the broad currency stability objective.”"

This will immediately improve the cash flow of thousands of exporters facing a weak export outlook for 2024,"" the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said.The RoSCTL refunds taxes for apparel and made-up sectors. RoDTEP covers most of the remaining products covered under about 8,500 tariff lines or product categories.It said that since the average RoDTEP rate is low at about 2.5 per cent, it is suggested that the refund amount can be transferred in cash to exporters' bank accounts post-export, as done in the case of the duty drawback scheme.Both the RoDTEP and duty drawback schemes refund unrefunded duties and are similar.Also, most small exporters do not import and have to sell the scrips to large importers who buy the scrips at varying discounts of up to 10 per cent of the scrip value, it added.""Many small value scrips remain unutilised also. The small exporter thus gets less than the announced incentive,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.He added that the cash refund will help thousands of exporters in employment-oriented sectors like marine, leather, gems and jewellery, agriculture, and other sectors like electrical/electronics, automobiles, machinery, and plastics.""Cash refunds would immediately improve the financial stability of exporters. Direct cash disbursements would eliminate the need for discounted scrip sales, ensuring that exporters receive the full value of their refunds,"" Srivastava added.Small firms, which form a significant part of India's export economy, would be particularly advantaged by this, helping them to compete more effectively on a global scale, he said."

Consumer prices have been flat or declining for months. Authorities appear at a loss to turn the situation around, assuming they want to","When China was busy leapfrogging incumbent industrial giants in the first years of this century, the Federal Reserve was increasingly worried about a very different challenge, one that presently confronts Beijing: deflation. Significant efforts by the Fed went into heading off such a troubling development in the US. China could learn a trick or two.In holding a key interest rate on Monday, the People’s Bank of China delivered more than a surprise: The bank missed an opportunity to set a narrative at the start of what's likely to be another tough year. Long feted for its rapid economic development the past four decades, China is now wrestling with an economy that is underperforming. Consumer prices have been flat or declining for months. Authorities appear at a loss to turn the situation around, assuming they want to.Monetary policy isn't the answer to every problem, or perhaps even most. And, yes, the PBOC doesn't have the independence or institutional authority vested in the Fed or the European Central Bank. But even the small cut most economists had anticipated would have at least signaled the PBOC was on the case. Sure, it's probably only a matter of time before an easing comes. Why delay? It's not that China's economy requires merely some fine-tuning. When the consumer price index began declining in July, the slide was characterised as a blip and not a feature of the disappointing overall recovery. The fall in December was the third in a row and marks the longest deflationary streak since 2009.PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng may not have wanted to rain on the big event this week, the release of fourth-quarter gross domestic product numbers. The expansion is projected to have been a bit more than 5 percent from a year earlier, meeting the target set by the government in March. A growth clip of that magnitude is a marked improvement on 2022, but far short of the hope that was widespread in the opening months of 2023. Bulls foresaw an economy replete with pent-up demand, waiting to be unleashed after the burial of Covid Zero. The target was derided as conservative. Now, it looks good.Fiscal policy is supportive: The budget is expansionary and bit by bit authorities have unveiled assistance for the beleaguered housing industry. Policymakers may also be worried that a rate reduction would weaken the yuan, which is recovering from a difficult 2023. China's economy won't collapse, but nor will it soar. The halcyon days of 2003 and 2004, when GDP grew at such a brisk clip that it easily overhauled traditional powers like France and Italy, represents an era consigned to the history books. Back then, Beijing denied that China was overheating. That insistence was met with skepticism: Rates would soon rise, and in 2005, the currency was allowed to appreciate. From today's perspective, a too-warm economy would be a good problem to have.It would be one thing to have accompanied Monday’s status-quo decision with some language that hinted at a resolute determination to get prices back into positive territory and keep them there. But that didn't happen. Contrast that with the alarm displayed by the Federal Open Market Committee during a worrying episode in 2003. “Given the difficulties of exiting very low inflation or even deflation, most FOMC participants agreed that the situation must be avoided at all costs,” Ben Bernanke, then a Fed governor and later the institution's chair, wrote in 21st Century Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve from the Great Inflation to Covid-19. “By mid-2003 deflation was `Topic A' in the Committee discussions.”Alan Greenspan, head of the Fed at the time, instructed staff to prepare options for dealing with this situation. The Fed opted for some reduction in borrowing costs, but more importantly, at a time when Fed communicationwas not yet an art form, went out of its way to signal policy would remain easy — and that officials were alert to the problem. A further dip in inflation would be “unwelcome,” the Fed announced. Looking back, the commitment can be interpreted as the start of meaningful forward guidance. According to Bernanke, it was also the first time the FOMC publicly acknowledged that it had an inflation target. (The numerical goal of 2 percent wouldn’t be officially enshrined until 2012.)If the PBOC has raised such an unmistakable alarm, the world is yet to hear it. More's the pity.Daniel Moss is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg "

For example, 2022 implies 2022-23 and so on.(Illustration: Moneycontrol)Table 2 puts the Indian economy in context, in terms of the economies of UK, Germany and Japan. As of 2024, the Indian economy when seen at PPP is 3.6 times that of the UK, 2.1 times that of Japan, and 2.5 times that of Germany. Table 2: Size of the Indian Economy at PPP as of 2024(Illustration: Moneycontrol)While most advanced economies (AEs) are facing an economic slowdown, chronic shortages, high inflation, and ageing populations, the Indian economy is acknowledged to be the fastest-growing large economy by major multilateral organisations, including the IMF.The Expansion of The Indian Consumer: Burgeoning Middle Class Amidst Low Cost of LivingThe implications of a high PPP nominal GDP can be easily understood in the growing strength of the Indian consumer in recent years. PPP allows us to understand and make comparisons between two countries- in this case, India and other high income countries such as Germany, Japan, etc- about the price of the same goods and services. Thus, a PPP analysis shows the price of the same goods and services in different economies, adjusted for parity. A high PPP implies that a basic set of essential goods and services is cheaper inside India, for an Indian consumer, than the same basket would be for a consumer in Japan, Germany or the UK. To put it simply, India has made significant improvements in public life and economy allowing for a low cost of living, across the population. This has also resulted in India being generally safe against inflation shocks and shocks of the global economy.The Indian middle class, therefore, is increasingly well off, while also expanding significantly. Estimates based on the PRICE's ICE 360 pan-India primary surveys across 2014, 2016 and 2021, suggest that the population of deprived and aspiring people will decrease from almost 1.1 billion to 150 million in the 2040s. The top income segment - the rich - will soar from 30 million to an estimated 310 million, while the huge bulk of the population will comprise a middle class of nearly 1.25 billion. Picture 1: India’s income groups, projected till 2047. Source: People Research on Indian Consumer Economy (PRICE), pan-India surveys. (illustration: Moneycontrol)By 2047, if political and economic reforms have their desired effect, the income pyramid will gradually develop into a 'fat lady' - with a smallish bottom of the deprived and aspirers, a huge bulge in the middle of the middle class and a big head of the rich.Eradication of Extreme Poverty at the Global US $1.9 PPP Poverty LineAlong with improvements in general purchasing power of the middle class, and a low cost of living, India has also almost completely eradicated extreme poverty at the global PPP poverty level of US$ 1.9. The World Bank categorises those in ‘extreme poverty’ as those who live on less than US $1.9 PPP per day globally. According to an IMF working paper from 2022, this figure has remained less than 1 percent since pre-pandemic times for India, reaching its lowest in the pre-pandemic year of 2019 with a 0.8 percent.This eradication of extreme poverty has uniquely occurred due to a mix of efficient social security measures and targeted foodgrain distribution by key Union Government schemes. The IMF paper concluded that the food handouts primarily had a substantial impact on keeping the levels of extreme poverty low. This study highlights the effect of food transfer and social security schemes on poverty alleviation and purchasing power of the poor. As a result of robust food grain coverage and distribution, the shocks in food price and income levels were offset by the scheme, allowing beneficiaries to remain above the poverty line in terms of purchasing power.The primary discussion of food transfers in the IMF working paper arises from the results of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), announced in March 2020 to ease the pressures caused by the pandemic. According to PMGKAY, each individual of an impoverished household receives an additional free 5 kilograms of grain over the existing 25 kilograms of subsidised food grains under the prevailing National Food Security Act (NFSA).As of November 2023, this scheme was extended for another 5 years. This will ensure that any future shocks arising from global events and food inflation will not worsen the condition of the poor in India. Picture 2 below shows the expanded coverage as of the extension of the PMGKAY. Picture 2: The Extended Coverage of the PMGKAY Scheme, Starting from 1st January, 2024.

(illustration: Moneycontrol)What Works for India, and Potential ChallengesSeveral global analysts have declared India as the next great economic power: Goldman Sachs predicted it will become the world’s second-largest economy by 2075, and Financial Times has suggested that by 2050, India’s purchasing power will be 30 percent larger than that of the U.S. Several demand and supply factors are crucial in achieving this, most of which show certain positive trends.On the demand side, India is facing a consumer boom, with significant improvements in consumption power being seen in the economy each year. India’s growth will be driven mainly by domestic consumption and investments. Real wages are expected to grow at above 4 percent, and disposable income is expected to grow by about 15 percent. Industries prevalent in the West are fast-growing industries in India, and consumer durables were expected to grow by about 15-18 percent in 2023. On the supply side, by 2030, India’s working-age population is expected to be 1.04 billion. The working-age population bulge is expected to last till 2055. Additionally, India also has the largest pool of English-speaking STEM graduates in the world.Infrastructurally, India is on the right track, in recent years. India has been adding 10,000 km of highways annually. The number of Indian airports has doubled and an upgraded train system will have new high efficiency “freight corridors” connecting the economic centres of India. Additionally, one of the most impressive changes has been in the digital infrastructure. With 881.25 million internet subscribers, India has the second-highest internet-enabled population in the world behind China’s 1.05 billion. As a result, the Digital Payments Infrastructure has seen a huge boom, making India the leading country in the world in terms of digital payments. All of this has helped make public services and credit more easily accessible to a wider swath of the population.India stands in a favourable position today, both in terms of economic growth and domestic cost of living. It remains then, to ensure this robust foundation is effectively steered towards realising the full future potential of the modern Indian economy. Going forward, India should ensure this tradition of good governance continues. Fostering Centre-State cooperation will allow wider coverage and better implementation of Central Schemes, ensuring that improvements in standard of living continue for the foreseeable future.The author Navneet Sehgal is the Retired Additional Chief Secreatry, Uttar Pradesh."

269,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/budget-2024-what-agriculture-needs-12054441.html,Budget 2024: What agriculture needs,"January 16, 2024 06:21 PM IST","The themes that can be focussed on in the interim budget include taking out more people out of agriculture towards other gainful employment, preventing soil and water resources and pursuing crop diversification, prioritising horticulture, livestock and fisheries","The presentation of the interim budget on February 1, 2024, on the eve of Lok Sabha elections (in April-May 2024) should normally be a muted affair. But the precedent of the interim budget of 2019 has set a new benchmark when a much needed, but entirely new scheme of direct income support, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, was not only announced but it was also made applicable from December 2018. The first PM-Kisan installment was disbursed to a large number of land holders before the 2019 elections. Should we expect a similar announcement this year?During the pandemic years of 2020-21 and 2021-22, the share of Gross Value Added (GVA) of agriculture and allied sectors in the  economy was 20.3 percent and 19 percent, respectively. As the other sectors of economy bounced back, the share of agriculture came down to 18.3 percent in 2022-23. This is not bad news as the more productive sectors have staged a comeback. The income levels in these sectors are higher for their employees. Most agricultural land holdings are very small and those depending on agriculture earn only a subsistence income. Many small landholders depend on wages from other sectors of the economy for subsistence.This being the situation of agriculture, the interim budget needs to provide a direction to the full budget which will be presented after the formation of a new Government.Themes For Interim BudgetI think the interim budget should take into account three major themes.First, it should be able to provide a roadmap for better paying employment opportunities so that some agricultural workers can move out and earn better income. This will require bold and imaginative thinking which is not based on any dogma.Textiles, garments, leather, food processing, warehousing, cold chain infrastructure, hotels and tourism etc. can absorb some surplus workers who are today subsisting on very low incomes from agriculture. Some of these sectors contribute handsomely to India’s goods exports. There is a need to provide high quality infrastructure so that these industries are globally competitive.The second priority within the agriculture sector should be to prevent the degradation of soil and water resources of India’s original green revolution regions in north-west – Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand. The ecological threat in these areas is well known not only to the Government but also to the farmers themselves.But the policy support, administrative commitment and required funding has not been forthcoming to achieve any significant diversification from water guzzling crops. It would be naïve to expect Punjab and Haryana to find financial resources on their own to compensate farmers, at least for a couple of years, to reduce area under non-basmati paddy.Haryana has been providing an incentive for diversification from paddy - Rs 2,400 per acre for maize and Rs 3,600 per acre for pulses. But due to the precarious financial situation of Punjab and different political parties ruling at the Centre, serious efforts have not even started preparing a credible roadmap for funding diversification. A central package is necessary for saving India’s most agriculturally aware state from an ecological disaster.The third priority of the budget should be to support horticulture, livestock and fishery sectors as the dietary preferences are changing towards more nutritious and protein-rich food. An urgent need to check widespread malnutrition among the poor population can be achieved by increasing their consumption of proteins. About seventy percent of India’s population is non-vegetarian and meat is a cheap source of protein for them.The policies and budget allocations should reflect the opportunities in the rural economy to increase productivity of these items. The marketing infrastructure for them needs large investment by the Government and private sector.In the last ten years, the Government has taken a number of appreciable decisions to support the agriculture and allied sectors. Repeal of three farm laws was seen as a setback to the reforms of agricultural marketing. The momentum for reforms needs to be regained in tune with the ground realities in various states.Siraj Hussain is a former Union Agriculture Secretary.

270,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-buying-the-consumption-story-12053421.html,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Buying the consumption story,"January 15, 2024 03:42 PM IST","In this edition of Moneycontrol Pro Panorama: India Inc benefits from falling tax rates, decoding IIP data on consumption, time to be cautious even as markets touch a new high, Taiwan election a loss of face for China, and more","Dear Reader, Last week ended with news that Tata Consumer Products, which has been on the prowl for big acquisitions for some time, bagged two companies. One was Capital Foods that has carved out a niche with its range of Chinese noodles, sauces and condiments and another was Organic India, which sells premium products in categories such as teas and infusions and packaged foods.The amount in question is significant at Rs 7,000 crore and may have been even higher but for the structure. The Organic India purchase is for a 100 percent stake, but involves an additional payout if the business hits certain targets in FY26. The Capital Foods acquisition involves Tata Consumer buying a 75 percent stake, with the founder staying on as a consultant. Tata Consumer retains a right to purchase the balance 25 percent stake belonging to the founder over three years. This implies that the founder helps run the business, helping Tata Consumer meet its integration and business targets, and potentially may earn a higher payout for the stake. Do read our two takes on the acquisition, here and here.Making acquisitions work, it is said, depends a lot on culture and strategy, some say. But success of these two acquisitions also depends on how well India’s consumer market grows in the coming years. One of the worries facing FMCG companies at present is that the market is not seeing uniform growth across consuming classes. Companies are reporting good growth in the premium segments despite headwinds such as stiff inflation. But the mass segments are seeing cracks, as reported by companies.One question that remains to be answered is whether it is solely income stress that is reflecting in performance or whether the organised players have raised prices so much, that consumers are shifting to lower-priced brands sold by smaller, regional players or even unbranded products.But macro data does support the theory that consumption has been hurt in recent years. My colleague Manas Chakravarty writes, “The latest data point is the advance estimate of national income for 2023-24, which puts growth in private consumption at a low 4.4 percent. That’s the lowest in many years, excluding the pandemic-hit year of 2020-21. Excluding that year, the last time growth in private consumption was so low was in 2008-09, during the Global Financial Crisis, when it was 4.45 percent. Interestingly, GDP growth in that year was a mere 3.1 percent.”Even IIP data is showing that between April-November 2019 and April-November 2023, the index of consumer non-durables has risen by only 3.7 percent. What does that imply? Do read his piece to know more.The expensive valuations at which FMCG stocks trade cannot sustain for long if the mass market consumption does not come back roaring. The long-term market opportunity that India offers is undeniable, but the speed bumps on that runway are causing a few jitters, for sure. If the slowdown continues, then acquisitions may become a much sought-after source for attaining growth. In the near term, all eyes will be on whether the Budget strikes a few blows for low-income consumers to boost their buying power.Meanwhile, Moneycontrol carried out a survey of CEOs in the run-up to the Budget. They seem a pragmatic lot, with a sizeable number expecting both inflation and interest rates to hold in the first half of 2024. They are an optimistic lot also, with nearly all of them being cautiously optimistic or very optimistic. But their caution on hiring, with a fifth saying they don’t plan to hire and a third saying it depends on market demand, is a sign that current conditions are not very supportive. For overall consumption to pick up pace, one needs the entire income pyramid and not just the affluent to be in a mood to spend.Investing insights from our research teamShould investors subscribe to Medi Assist IPO?Wipro Q3 FY24 – Why the valuation discount to peers could narrowHCL Tech Q3FY24 – a show of strengthD-Mart: Margin improvement to sustain; strong long-term growth prospectsWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Last-minute mystery buyer in Infy, benaami reversal deadline, small cap (dis)order, a comeback for Polycab? Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | It is time to be cautious even as markets touch a new highBudget Snapshot | Corporate India benefits from falling tax ratesA big capital goods revival?

But despite these, Indian macro-fundamentals have strengthened in this period,"" she said.The economist said the rupee has been relatively stable due to these factors.""Economic diversity, adequate buffers, and feasible reforms... have enabled policies to be countercyclical. We have the capability to implement countercyclical policy and smooth external shocks,"" she said.Indian economy is projected to grow 7.3 per cent in the current fiscal, higher than 7.2 per cent in 2022-23.As per the International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) World Economic Outlook, global growth is estimated to decelerate from 3.5 per cent in 2022 to 3 per cent in 2023 and further to 2.9 per cent in 2024.The situation around the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a crucial shipping route connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, has escalated due to recent attacks by Yemen-based Houthi militants.Due to these attacks, shippers are taking consignments through the Cape of Good Hope, resulting in delays of almost 14 days and also higher freight and insurance costs.The Red Sea route is also crucial for energy shipments.Replying to a question on his outlook on inflation for 2024, Goyal emphasised that the recent spikes in commodity prices have tended to be short-term and were not able to upset a steady softening of core inflation towards the target of 4 per cent.""As more and more firms and consumers internalise the inflation target, I see the economy approaching it (RBI's inflation target of 4 per cent) in 2024,"" Goyal said.Elaborating further, she said, the current MPC has shown that inflation can be kept in check despite severe adverse supply shocks and while supporting good growth.Noting that the average headline inflation has remained below 6 per cent during the term of the current MPC, Goyal said, ""The first MPC had the advantage of falling oil prices, while we have had to face the pandemic, supply chain snarls and war related oil price rise.""According to the latest government data, retail inflation rose at the fastest pace in four months in December 2023 at 5.69 per cent, on account of an increase in prices of vegetables, pulses, and spices.The RBI has been tasked by the government to ensure retail inflation remains at 4 per cent, with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.On whether the government needs to make a more realistic assessment of its medium-term fiscal deficit target, she said tax buoyancy from higher growth and from tax reform, combined with counter-cyclical fiscal policy, gives India a possible escape route from a history of higher deficits that created debt ratios exceeding its peer countries.""Fiscal consolidation will strengthen our macroeconomic fundamentals even more and reduce risks further, while building space to respond to future shocks,"" Goyal said, adding that the announced medium-term fiscal deficit is eminently feasible.It will not reduce growth since it will make room for rising private investment, she said.""Smart green public infrastructure, with timely completion rates, can continue to crowd in private investment,"" Goyal added."

There have allegedly been instances where life insurance policies were sold to customers aged above 75 years in tier-II and III cities.Usually, branches of banks push the products of their subsidiary insurers. When resisted by customers, branch officials would sheepishly admit that they were under pressure from the top. Insurance products are flogged when customers go to banks to seek a loan or make a term deposit.In this regard, the DFS letter had said, the department has already issued a circular stating that a bank should not force customers to get insurance from a particular company.Orders from aboveLast year, several bankers told Moneycontrol , on condition of anonymity, that they were facing immense pressure from the top management to sell third-party products such as insurance. Failure to meet targets invited informal penal actions while meeting targets brought perks such as parties in five-star resorts.Banks typically cross-sell the insurance products of their subsidiaries, and sometimes of other companies, along with loan products. Often, banks insist on the purchase of policies along with loan products.“We are forced to sell insurance products. Despite the fact that we are bankers, we have become agents of insurance companies,” lamented a manager-level employee of Bank of Baroda, on condition of anonymity. “In the last 1-2 years, core banking work has been disturbed badly as our workforce was involved more in selling insurance products,” said the official.CH Venkatachalam, General Secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), said insurance companies typically offer gifts to bank managers for selling their products.“Insurance companies also treat some of the bank managers who canvas more insurance products. They entertain them lavishly with trips abroad and here, and other things,” said Venkatachalam."

The US and UK intensified efforts to liberate the Red Sea area from the rebels","Dear Reader,Results from IT giants Infosys and TCS contributed to a positive shift in market sentiment last week. The week initially began on a negative note and remained mostly subdued. However, a significant upward movement on Friday propelled the benchmark indices to close at new all-time highs. On January 12, the Sensex and Nifty reached fresh record levels of 72,720.96 and 21,928.25, respectively.Despite the positive market trends, the week was marred by developments in the Middle East, where the conflict with Yemen's Houthis took a new turn. The US and UK intensified efforts to liberate the Red Sea area from the rebels. Notably, last Thursday, Iran's navy seized an oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman, previously confiscated by the United States for violating sanctions related to Tehran's nuclear program. This incident further heightened tensions in the region.The market has so far absorbed these Middle East developments calmly. Iran's actions, particularly the seizure of the oil tanker, are perceived as a test of the US, and any escalation at this crucial juncture could lead to uncontrollable consequences.Cautious optimism Nifty moved higher towards the end of the week, though most indicators show a negative divergence. Except for the short-term oversold condition, other indicators support the view of a market top near 22,000 in Nifty.While the near-term momentum appears strong, the volume peaks are typical of market tops. Note that a market top is a process, not an event; according to us, January 2024 continues to be a topping process.The swing, seen in the chart below, reached the oversold reading of 17, after which the market bounced back. The retracement coincided with support near the 20dma. Over the next few days, watch out for a trend reversal as traders will reduce their position because it is the penultimate week ahead of the expiry.Source: web.strike.moneyDespite the selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in the cash market amounting to Rs 3,901.27 crore, they have maintained their positions in the derivatives market. Regardless of the market's direction, FIIs retain approximately 75,000-85,000 long contracts. This pattern is similar to the behaviour observed during the market's peak in July '23 when a reversal occurred after weeks of divergence. We will have to be patient till the FIIs throw in the towel.Source: web.strike.moneyThe chart below shows the net new one-month highs for the Nifty 500. The arrows on the chart highlight moments when the new one-month high data shows a negative or positive divergence relative to the index. A negative divergence, as seen presently, precedes a market top. Whether the market follows the same behaviour this time around, we will know over the next few days, if not weeks.Source: web.strike.moneyIndices and Market BreadthBut the market would have ended in the red, except for the sharp recovery on Friday. The rebound helped the Sensex close 0.75 per cent higher and the Nifty gain 0.84 percent during the week.Along with the benchmark index, the BSE-Largecap, BSE-Midcap, and BSE-Smallcap touched record highs during the week.The IT sector led the rise with a 4.5 percent gain during the week, followed by Realty, which gained 4.3 per cent. The energy and Automobile sectors moved up 2 per cent each. The sectors under pressure were FMCG, down 1.7 percent, and the Bank index, which fell 0.9 per cent.Among the stocks that gained the most was Wardwizard Innovations at 38.90 percent, Kamdhenu was up 34.16 per cent, and Suven Life Sciences closed 34.15 per cent higher. The top losers during the week were Sanmit Infra, which fell 34.83 per cent; Inox Wind, which lost 13.60 per cent; and Waaree Renewables, which saw an erosion of 12.02 per cent.Global MarketDeveloped world markets continued their rally higher despite the events in the Middle East. The US and Europe ended the week higher as the market focused on inflation and other economic data. However, the UK, China, Hong Kong, and Kospi closed the week in red.In the US, too, IT stocks were in the limelight, with the rally being led by frontline stocks. However, banking stocks were under pressure as major banks reported subdued numbers. The stocks were also under pressure after the consumer price inflation data exceeded expectations.Despite the rise in inflation, expectations for a rate cut in March moved to 79.5 per cent from 73.2 per cent in the prior session.Stocks to watchAmong the frontline stocks showing strong momentum on the upside are ACC, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Ceat, Reliance Industries, Dr Reddy’s Labs, SBI, and Hindalco.Stocks showing weakness are HUL, Dabur, Hindustan Zinc, Navin Fluorine, and Page Industries.Cheers,Shishir Asthana"

Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation was at 0.26 percent in November 2023 and 5.02 percent in December 2022.At 0.73 percent, it is the second month in a row that wholesale inflation has printed in above zero. However, for 2023-24 as a whole, average WPI inflation remains in the deflationary zone at -1.1 percent.The latest WPI data comes days after the statistics ministry said headline retail inflation rose to a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December, up 14 basis points from November.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.To be sure, the rise in WPI inflation in the last month of 2023 was driven by a highly unfavourable base effect. In December 2022 - the month that forms the base for calculating the rate of inflation for December 2023 - the all-commodity index of the WPI had contracted by 1.3 percent month-on-month (MoM). As such, even though the price momentum - or rise in wholesale prices from one month to the next - weakened, inflation rose from 0.26 percent in November to 0.73 percent in December.In December, the price indices for all three major groups of the WPI were lower than the previous month:>> Primary articles price index down 2.1 percent MoM>> Fuel and power price index down 0.71 percent MoM>> Manufactured products price index down 0.21 percent MoMAs a result, the all-commodity index of the WPI was down 0.85 percent MoM, while the food index was 1.75 percent lower from November, thanks to a sequential drop in prices of vegetables, fruits, eggs, meat, fish, and pulses.Also Read: Cooking at home gets 3-5% cheaper as veggies, chicken cost lessA rise in wholesale inflation in December was expected, and economists see it increasing further in the coming months even as headline retail inflation eases from current levels.

In recognition of the basic reality that, irrespective of the miracle technology that it may be, AI ultimately exists to benefit people and not the other way around.Need Balanced Discussion On AIThe reason for bringing this up is because all that one seems to hear the most whenever AI gets mentioned is about machines becoming super-intelligent by the day, and how increasing use of artificial intelligence can spell wonders for global and national economic growth and, also, boost organisational productivity.With forecasts made by reputable consulting firms and those engaged in the field of AI getting bandied about all the time to strengthen the argument about the merits of artificial intelligence, especially the PwC study about the potential AI holds to raise the global GDP 14 per cent by 2030, equivalent to an additional $15.7 trillion.What is heard of much less in comparison is how increasing use of AI is going to make a difference in the lives of ordinary people, especially for those living in developing countries, in ways that they can relate to. Sure, there is the odd mention from time to time about how AI can improve healthcare services, education delivery, etc., but the detailed reply to the “what is in it for me” question that average citizens want answered often does not come through amid all the talk on the great possibilities of the technology.The Future Of JobsWhich brings one to the issue of jobs and livelihoods. To those in the employable age anywhere who don't believe in an apocalyptic scenario where machines take over the world, the biggest question that they immediately want answered on AI is how increasing sophistication of the technology and its deployment could affect their existing or prospective jobs, preferably in the form of a country-wise breakdown. They also want a data-backed assessment of how soon the jobs that AI is likely to take away would be replaced by more, new, and better-quality ones, besides whether the projections made in the WEF’s “The Future of Jobs Report 2023” still hold true.Getting answers to these questions assumes critical importance for those living in developing countries since their nations face huge financial challenges in providing social security support. How essential these replies can be in the context of India, the world’s most populous nation, can be gauged from the fact that, at over 400 million, the total size of India’s current workforce exceeds the population of the United States, the world’s richest nation.On AI, the WEF’s “The Future of Jobs Report 2023” had said: “Artificial intelligence, a key driver of potential algorithmic displacement, is expected to be adopted by nearly 75% of surveyed companies and is expected to lead to high churn – with 50% of organizations expecting it to create job growth and 25% expecting it to create job losses.”Over the years, the annual meetings of the World Economic Forum have played a pivotal role in setting the direction in which the world should move. This role assumes even more significance in 2024 when elections are due in several important countries, and one would hope that the WEF would come up with a clear roadmap on how AI could emerge as a force for good for all.Sumali Moitra is a current affairs commentator.

278,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/supply-chains-canals-arent-even-the-worlds-biggest-shipping-chokepoints-12052031.html,Supply Chains: Canals aren’t even the world's biggest shipping chokepoints,"January 15, 2024 10:05 AM IST","Five thousand miles from the canals of Suez and Panama lie even more important shipping lanes, chokepoints that could cripple global trade should any disaster befall them","When traffic through the Suez Canal ground to a halt in 2021, the extraordinary cost and disruptions to global commerce seemed overwhelming. But 5,000 miles from the canals of Suez and Panama lie even more important shipping lanes, chokepoints that could cripple global trade should any disaster befall them.More than a quarter of goods transport passes through a 25-mile wide stretch of water that separates Indonesia to the southwest from Singapore and Malaysia to the northeast, known as the Malacca Strait. By value, the 27.9 percent of merchandise sent around the world that traverses this  body of water far exceeds the 16.6 percent that move along the Suez Canal in Egypt, according to research by Professor Lincoln Pratson at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment.In a paper published last month in the journal Communications in Transportation Research, Pratson painstakingly details trade patterns, shipping routes and the shortest paths across the oceans to assess the potential impact of closing any of the 13 chokepoints he identified around the world. He used 2019 data as that’s the most recent year in which trade could be considered “normal” before Covid-19 disrupted global commerce, and ran the analysis on commerce between non-neighbouring countries because those that share a border are likely to use land routes.Around 1,000 miles northeast of the Malacca Strait, swathes of the South China Sea are claimed by no less than seven nations, making military conflict the most obvious risk. “The chokepoints estimated to carry the most trade in terms of both total value and total weight are the Malacca Strait and South China Sea,” Pratson writes. The South China Sea alone carries trade equivalent to 5 percent of global GDP, which would make it the fourth-largest economy in the world.Exactly how much trade transits the South China Sea is a much debated point. The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated the value at $3.4 trillion for 2016, 36 percent less than other assessments for the same time period. Pratson puts it at $4.1 trillion for 2019, with $3.9 trillion going via the Malacca Strait. There’s some overlap, because goods pass through multiple sea lanes on the way to their final destination.The precise number doesn’t really matter. What’s important for shippers, manufacturers, and governments is to understand the severity of the impact should a disaster happen. The ripple effect from the complete closure of any waterway can be felt thousands of miles away.When the Ever Given cargo ship shut down the Suez Canal three years ago, it added around nine days to a Taiwan-Netherlands trip, Pratson notes, with the cost to global trade climbing close to $10 billion per day. The 20-mile wide Ombai Strait, 7,000 miles away — between Indonesia’s Alor Island and Timor — would suffer a 90 percent drop in traffic from a Suez closure. Even the Gibraltar Strait that separates Europe and Africa — 2,000 miles northwest of the Suez — would lose 28 percent of shipping flows, by value.But perhaps the biggest impact would be from a closure of the Malacca Strait or South China Sea. Should maritime passage get halted here, the nearby and little-known Lombok-Makassar Strait — north of Bali — would experience a 14-fold rise in trade flow. We’ve yet to see whether this stretch of water has the capacity to carry such volume safely.More than 20 percent, by value, of all mechanical machinery, electrical equipment, mineral fuels like coal, gas and oil, and rare metals or minerals pass through the Malacca Strait. Similar figures apply to the South China Sea, while the East China Sea — connecting Taiwan with Japan, South Korea and China’s northeast — also ranks high. Each of these three passages surpass Panama and Suez, with only the English Channel and Gibraltar Strait holding similar importance.The risks to these Asian waterways needn’t be confined to war — currently impacting the Suez Canal as Houthi rebels fire missiles at ships passing through the adjoining Red Sea, and slowing trade through Turkey’s Bosporus Strait that takes traffic from the Black Sea where Ukraine is fending off a Russian invasion.A drought, like the one that’s hurting Panama Canal flows, won’t dry up the South China Sea or Malacca Strait. But there’s a multitude of other disasters that could hit maritime transport. Think earthquakes and their resultant tsunamis, typhoons, which are common to the region, chemical spills and nuclear accidents that force ships to change course, or forest fires sending plumes of thick smoke across the waters, impacting navigation.Even without one-time incidents, the region is already the most treacherous in the world. A quarter of all ships lost in 2022 were in the area spanning South China through to Indonesia, according to analysis by Allianz Group. Still, though tragic, the rare sunk or stranded ship won’t much affect the trajectory of global trade.What matters most is that the global system of logistics and transport, as it’s presently structured, is overly dependent on smooth and orderly flows in just a few of the world’s hotspots that make up a tiny fraction of the Earth’s surface. Just 21.5 percent of global trade does not pass through one of the 13 chokepoints.This hasn’t been a problem, so far. Supply chains have been resilient enough, with sufficient spare capacity along shipping routes to allow the sector to get through relatively small crises unscathed. But we need to be ready in case the planet encounters a major event. The knock-on effects for port operations, global manufacturing, and energy security could be devastating.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Step away from Google,"January 15, 2024 09:52 AM IST","When researchers exposed volunteers to a mix of fake and real news stories, they found people became more prone to being fooled by fake stories after being asked to do an internet search","Searching for information has become instant and effortless — just go to your nearest device, ask Siri or click a few keys. But are we better informed than we were before Google became a verb?A new paper published in Nature hints that we’re not. When researchers exposed volunteers to a mix of fake and real news stories, they found people became more prone to being fooled by fake stories after being asked to do an internet search.That doesn’t negate the value of search engines, but as with all technology, there can be unintended consequences. Searches on misleading stories often pull people into a spiral of yet more bad information.The Nature paper included results of several studies. In some, people were asked to evaluate news stories that had just broken in the last 48 hours. In one, they saw stories from recent months on Covid-19, spanning scientific, political and economic angles. In some cases, people were randomly assigned to evaluate stories with or without doing their own search, and in others, the same people were asked to evaluate news items before and after a search.Participants could classify stories as true, false/misleading, or undetermined. Before doing any research, about 30% of people incorrectly labeled false items as true. Searching led to about a 20% increase over that — after doing online research, about 36% of people classified fake news as fact. While subjects could use any search engine, most chose Google.University of Central Florida social scientist Kevin Aslett, who led the study while at the Center for Social Media and Politics at NYU, said people put an incredible amount of trust in search engines — more than they put in the mainstream media. And advocates for news literacy often encourage people to go online to check questionable news stories. That’s why he thought online searching deserves more critical attention.Some of the fake stories included an impending mini ice age; thousands arrested for deliberately setting wildfires in Australia; homeless people defecating in San Francisco supermarket aisles; and news that hydroxychloroquine trials were “designed to kill Covid-19 patients.”These stories share an emotional valence, touching on such contentious issues as Covid-19 business and school closures, vaccines and vaccine mandates, the Black Lives Matter protests, claims that Covid-19 originated in a laboratory, and various statements by and about former President Donald Trump.Looking at how people searched gave Aslett and his colleagues a clue as to why they were becoming increasingly fooled. Stories from what he called low quality news sources often used words or phrases that were specific to a particular claim. One false news item accused President Biden of engineering a famine. If people googled “engineered famine” they would find other dubious stories, because mainstream news sites didn’t use that phrase.People are often taught bad approaches to searching, said Joel Breakstone, director of the Stanford History Education Group. They are sometimes wrongly taught they should trust .org sites, for example, or that they should not use Wikipedia.Some of his own research compared the search methods of professional fact checkers, academics and students, and found the fact checkers gained an edge by more diligently checking into the credibility of a source. People are often deceived by the names of some sources, he said. They thought the Employment Policies Institute was a neutral source, for instance, when further examination would reveal it’s run by a PR firm that works on the behalf of the food and beverage industry and has a vested interest in keeping the minimum wage low.Fact checkers also tended scan the results a search engine brings up before selecting which items to read, while other people in his research focused most of their attention on whatever the search algorithm placed on top, assuming that was the highest quality item without putting any thought into how the algorithms work.One caveat is that even fact checkers don’t always agree. That was also true in the Nature paper, in which six professional fact checkers also vetted each story. The stories on which the fact checkers differed were also the ones where searching led people away from the majority view.  These included stories under the headlines, “German Official Leaks Report Denouncing COVID-19 As ‘A Global False Alarm,’” “Leftie Governor Cooper Kills RNC Convention in Charlotte Due to COVID-19 And Then Goes and Marches with Leftist Mob in Street,” and “Forced Vaccinations Will Control Your Life, Warns Religious-Liberty Group.” All involved contentious material and some subjective judgements outside of concrete facts.What makes a story credible is complicated. Journalists should explain what they know and how they know it, and show where there’s uncertainty. This new study is a good reminder that the idea that anyone can access the truth with a few keystrokes was always too good to be true.FD Flam is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

It is adding to GDP too,"January 15, 2024 10:16 AM IST",Ease and convenience of spending has lowered the economy-wide cost of transaction. The resultant saving is triggering incremental spending. UPI is also enabling easier credit-driven household spending,"About 15 months ago, a seemingly counter-intuitive LinkedIn post ofAbhishek Patil had quickly spiralled into a talking point. In the post, the GrowthX founder had made a case about how United Payments Interface (UPI) was killing the toffee business.This, he argued, was because in a predominantly cash-driven world, neighbourhood grocery stores could be often seen offering toffee as a de facto alternative to loose change or coins. 'Chutta Nahi Hain’ (There’s no change), had become a standard tag, which customers too had come to accept and walk away with toffees in lieu of coins without much of a fuss.The post, which later triggered a public debate of sorts, may have been based on anecdotal observations. It, however, did bring to light a momentous change that was altering how Indians transact.In about eight years, India’s indigenously developed UPI, has evolved into the default option to transact—from small ticket purchases at roadside shops to settling utility bills to restaurant bills, to now IPO stock purchases and mutual fund payments.This transformation, which has now become a global template that many other countries are emulating, is founded on multiple edifices powered by a behavioural change among hundreds of millions.For the record, in December 2023, total transactions valued at Rs 18.23 trillion took place through UPI. The monthly volume stood at 12.02 billion.While UPI has made sending and receiving money at the tap of a mobile phone app, the bigger question is how has it added to India’s broader economy? Importantly, what has been the specific incremental contribution of UPI or India’s rapid digitalisation of payments to India’s gross domestic product (GDP).GDP, by definition, is the total value of goods and services in the country. Someone’s spending is someone else’s income. In the final national accounting analysis, the sum total of everyone’s expenditure is equivalent to the aggregation of everyone’s income.So, how has UPI, which has brought about remarkable ease and convenience in spending, helped in adding to GDP? Fundamentally, transactions that were earlier done on cash have moved digital. So, how can it add to GDP?The answer to this is two-fold. One is the opportunity cost. Two is through enabling easier credit-driven spending.Lower Cash, Lower Transaction CostEase and convenience of spending lowers the economy-wide cost of transaction. The resultant saving triggers incremental spending at the aggregate level, adding to GDP.A proxy marker for this would be to analyse the drop in the cash-on-demand (COD) payment. UPI is becoming the primary mode of payment for e-commerce and taking away the share from COD orders. In terms of value, the share of UPI payments has increased from 26 percent to 52 percent between 2019 and 2023; while the cash payments have now reduced to mere 9 percent.Every COD order leads to an additional cost of about one dollar (about Rs 80). The industry processed nearly two billion orders in 2022. The COD orders have fallen by about 10 percentage points during this period – a reduction of 10 percent equalling 200 million orders. This shift from cash to UPI has effectively helped the e-commerce ecosystem save costs of nearly USD 200 million in 2022.According to the Economic Survey 2023, in 2018-19, UPI accounted for 17 percent of the country's total 31 billion digital transactions. The next fiscal year saw UPI’s share rise to more than 27 percent as it processed 12.50 billion transactions out of 46 billion digital transactions. In 2021-22, UPI accounted for 52 percent of the total 88.40 billion financial digital transactions.On average, between 2019 and 2022 (calendar year), growth in UPI-based transactions grew in value and volume terms by 121 percent and 115 percent, respectively.Real-time payments are likely to boost India’s GDP by USD 45.9 Billion in 2026 as real-time payments transaction volumes are set to exceed 206 billion by that time.In 2021, India accounted for the largest number of real-time transactions at 48.6 billion, almost threefold that of China (18 billion transactions) and almost seven times greater than the combined real-time payments volume of US, Canada, the UK, France, and Germany (7.5 billion).According to a 2022 report by ACI Worldwide, in partnership with GlobalData and the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr), real-time payments helped India unlock USD 16.4 billion of additional economic output in 2021, equivalent to 0.56 percent of formal GDP.According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) occasional paper, there has also been an increased interest by retail investors in the equity markets in digital brokerages since the outbreak of the pandemic resulting in high turnovers in the equity markets. This increased activity in the equity market could have in turn given a boost to UPI and card transactions since these are the preferred mode of payment to load money into trading accounts. The transaction limit for payments through UPI for Retail Direct Scheme andIPO applications has been increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.The share of small denomination notes has been on a decline. This has been in part due to the substitution of small-value cash payments by the UPI; the share of UPI payments in total volume of retail payments increased to 73 percent in 2022-23 from 63 percent a year ago.The average per transaction value for person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions through UPI stood at nearly Rs 750 in 2022-23, while it was below Rs 500 for prepaid mobile wallets.A PhonePe and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) joint report in 2022, which has projected that India’s digital payments ecosystem will nearly triple to $10 trillion by 2026 from $3 trillion in 2022, said that the UPI-based autopay today facilitates Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) from payment platforms and offers three primary benefits.First, there is increased awareness through active promotion by third party application providers (TPAPs). Second, autopay offers greater convenience, ensuring on-time payment of SIPs without intervention and helps avoid late fees. Third, it allows the customer to customise their investment choices and determine the frequency and amount for each mandate based on the requirement.The total mandates executed via UPI have reached approximately 32 million mandate transactions in March 2022. Similarly, top five remitter banks have seen 30-70 percent growth in their IPO volumes processed through UPI. “This can be primarily attributed to UPI attracting a wider demographic that is not necessarily limited by net banking access”, the report said.This additional household savings in financial asset classes would have contributed to incremental GDP, too.Easier Loans, Greater SpendUPI’s spread and wide acceptability has also opened up a unique opportunity to bring millions into the formal credit market system. UPI transactions’ history now serves as a mainstream proxy to measure people's loan repayment capacity based on their spending ability, which broadly mirrors their income levels.Lenders, particularly non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) now use this data to offer unsecured, small ticket, short-term credit to offer easy, convenient loans.Innovative payment systems are an important antecedent to the emergence of the NBFC and fintech sector across countries. Globally, countries with high usage of digital payments also exhibit high fintech activity.A central factor determining the pickup in fintech lending in India has been the introduction of UPI, which has enabled an almost-universal system of digital payments and eased many logistical and geographical barriers to credit flow.Barring the short-lived decline in fintech lending during the Covid-19 pandemic, UPI and fintech lending growth have both been rising in tandem.According to a November 2023 report of Centre for Advanced Financial Research and Learning (CAFRAL), an RBI-promoted organisation, “UPI uptake has allowed lenders to access alternate data to determine creditworthiness, and the fintech sector is more likely to do this as it operates primarily within the digital realm. UPI transactions also reduce the effective distance between borrowers and lenders, eliminating frictions and increasing banks’ willingness to lend. Overall, the results indicate a stronger relationship between UPI and fintech lending, relative to lending from scheduled commercial banks”.It is a fair hypothesis to run that additional lending enabled by UPI’s spread would have triggered higher spending, particularly in consumer durables such as appliances and also non-durables such as clothes. Such loans’ contribution to additional GDP cannot be disputed, even as its exact extent is a matter of detail.The PhonePe-BCG report has echoed similar views. It said that “a seamless payment journey embedded across e-commerce has become an obvious outcome of increased participation and engagement in digital payments with several benefits to users and merchants”.This, according to the report, has led to not only payments enabling financial services (embedded payments) such as UPI enabling equity and mutual fund investments but also, progression from embedded payments to embedded finance with the advent of BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) where financing is embedded during the payment stage at check-out.Gaurav Choudhury is consulting editor, Network 18.

It is, however, expected to decline to 4 percent in July-September 2024 on account of a favourable base effect before rising to 4.7 percent in the last quarter of the year, the Indian central bank's forecasts say.On the other hand, wholesale inflation, which is more aligned with the changes in costs faced by companies, is expected to rise in 2024.In 2023, a fall in global commodity prices compared to the previous year dragged down Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation sharply. It averaged exactly 0 percent in January-November 2023, with the second half of the year seeing wholesale inflation in negative territory.The WPI inflation data for December will be released at noon on January 15.According to CEOs, leading a diverse set of businesses such as banking, FMCG, and startups, keeping inflation in check is seen as a key priority for the government.With the double shock from the coronavirus pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupting supply lines, prices have fluctuated wildly over the last couple of years, with key commodities such as energy and food items witnessing a sharp rise in prices.The government has responded with a raft of measures to bring down retail prices of key food items such as vegetables, cereals and pulses.The findings of Moneycontrol’s poll are in line with the latest Business Inflation Expectations Survey, conducted by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The survey, released on January 6, found that while the one-year-ahead inflation expectations of Indian businesses had declined to 4.04 percent in November 2023, on average, expectations of firms had ""remained anchored around 4.2 percent for the past six consecutive months"".Steady on interest rates tooThe RBI, which is mandated to keep CPI inflation at 4 percent with a tolerance range of 2-6 percent, has left the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent since February 2023 after raising it by 250 basis points in 2022-23 to curb price rises. And Indian CEOs expect the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee to stay pat on rates in the coming months.As many as 59 percent of the CEOs surveyed think interest rates will likely remain unchanged in the next six months, while 30 percent expect them to fall during the period.Mirroring the responses on the inflation outlook, around 11 percent think interest rates may either rise or are not sure about the direction they might move in.Economists have been predicting that the RBI may look to cut the repo rate around the middle of 2024 as it gains clarity on CPI inflation reaching the medium-term target of 4 percent.""With the global monetary policy backdrop turning more benign, we bring forward our rate cutting cycle, now expecting RBI to deliver interest rate reductions from April-June, probably in the June MPC (meeting),"" said Rahul Bajoria, managing director and head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics for Barclays, following the release of CPI data for December on January 12.Bajoria expects the RBI to cut the repo rate by 75 basis points in the second half of 2024.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.While CEOs don't think interest rates will change in the first half of 2024, they are hoping the authorities will help in easing access to financial services through a variety of methods including a single window for know-your-customer (KYC) checks across products, more liberal farm loans and low-cost financing schemes to bolster infrastructure development in tier 2-3 areas."

While the government, in recent years, has acted to make it easier to do business, further reduction in such administrative obstacles may help unleash the 'animal spirits' of Indian entrepreneurs and investors, fostering economic growth and prosperity.""The top priority to boost economic growth is to create a conducive environment for manufacturing in India and to make it the single-largest alternative to China,"" a CEO said. The survey ensured anonymity for respondents to encourage them to express their views freely.Investment plansOver the past few years, the government has looked to drive growth and attract private investments by boosting capital expenditure on infrastructure projects. The survey results show the government's efforts may be yielding results, with 70 percent of CEOs saying their companies plan to invest in the next six months.""Encouraging private investment is pivotal to our economic resurgence,"" another CEO said. ""There is an urgent need to create an enabling environment by simplifying regulations and providing incentives, thereby fostering innovation and job creation across various sectors.""Gross fixed capital formation—a proxy for investments— is estimated to grow by 10.3 percent in the current fiscal year after an 11.4 percent increase in the previous year, according to the latest data.The private sector's plans to invest come on the back of improving demand, with 94 percent of CEOs saying the order books of their companies had either increased or 'somewhat increased' in the past two years.Interestingly, most CEOs plan to proceed with investments in the next six months even though around 60 percent of those surveyed see no reduction in interest rates.Also See | MC CEO Survey: A look at how Indian Inc titans view inflation, interest rates & other economic indicatorsThe Reserve Bank of India, which is mandated to keep headline retail inflation at 4 percent with a tolerance range of 2-6 percent, has left the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent since February 2023 after raising it by 250 basis points in 2022-23 to curb price rises.The central bank expects consumer price index (CPI) inflation will cool to 4 percent in July-September 2024, and then accelerate to 4.7 percent in the December quarter. Inflation averaged 5.4 percent in the December quarter of last year.When it comes to hiring, CEOs are slightly more cautious than their investment plans, with 49 percent responding positively when asked if they were looking to increase hiring significantly. Further, 32 percent of CEOs said their hiring plans were dependent on market conditions, with 19 percent having a muted outlook on new staff additions.Cause for concern?When it comes to the risks, they primarily fall into two categories: domestic and global.On the domestic front, more than a third of the surveyed CEOs think there are no major concerns to worry about. However, 28 percent of decision-makers see bureaucratic red tape as a barrier to business, with an additional 17 percent identifying policy uncertainty as an issue. In addition, 11 percent of CEOs are concerned by the uneven consumption demand.According to one of the CEOs surveyed, the government should stimulate consumer demand across sectors and support start-ups to help generate more jobs and boost consumption.In terms of the global situation, the sentiment is more pessimistic, with 36 percent of CEOs somewhat concerned by the global economic uncertainty and another 36 percent keeping a close watch on developments. Meanwhile, 13 percent of respondents are not at all concerned by global developments, although 15 percent are 'highly concerned'.Also Read: World Bank says global economy surprisingly resilient, but outlook 'dark'And despite the surge in COVID cases, only 2 percent of CEOs identified the situation as ""very worrying"".Overall, the survey paints an optimistic picture, reinforcing the consensus that India is a bright spot in an otherwise uncertain world."

Iran seized a tanker on Thursday carrying Iraqi crude south of the strait destined for Turkey.""Although the lack of shipping through the Red Sea… does create transportation issues for some crude supplies, the impact on the physical oil markets is, thus far, minimal,"" said Matt Stephani, president at investment advisory firm Cavanal Hill Investment Management.""If the conflict were to spread to the other side of the Arabian peninsula… oil markets may react much more significantly,"" Stephani added.Diversion of tankers around South Africa will also push up freight rates as ships take longer, more costly routes. Red Sea, a key route between Europe and Asia, accounts for about 15% of the world's shipping traffic.U.S. President Joe Biden said the ""targeted strikes"" in Yemen were a clear message that Washington and its partners will not ""allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation"".A Houthi spokesperson said the group would continue to target shipping heading toward Israel. Iran warned that the US-Britain attack on Houthis will fuel ""insecurity and instability"" in the region, according to Iranian state media.Saudi Arabia, a top oil exporter and regional power, called for restraint and ""avoiding escalation"" and said it was monitoring the situation with great concern.Also supporting oil prices, China bought record levels of crude oil over 2023, as demand recovered form a pandemic-induced slump despite economic headwinds in the world's biggest energy consumer.The premium of the first-month Brent contract to the six-month contract rose to as much as $2.09 a barrel on Friday, the highest since early November.

The price momentum weakened, with inflation increasing from November's 5.55 percent because of an unfavourable base effect. And as the base effect fades, inflation will only fall.""The January CPI inflation estimate is tracking at sub-5 percent, as the impact of adverse base wanes and softer food inflation led by winter season decline in vegetable prices,"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at IDFC First Bank.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects average CPI inflation to fall to 5.2 percent in the first quarter of 2024. Its forecast of 5.6 percent for October-December 2023 has already been undershot by 20 basis points.Meanwhile, industrial growth was expected to fall sharply in November from its 16-month high of 11.6 percent in October thanks to the holidays the penultimate month of 2023 saw on account of Diwali. That the headline IIP growth number of 2.4 percent missed expectations of 3.5 percent is beside the point, as economists are not really looking at monthly industrial production data, but instead the average for October-November.With Diwali occurring in November 2023 and in October 2022, the base effect has been rather wild, resulting in IIP growth jumping to 11.6 percent in October 2023 and then falling in the subsequent month.Industrial production had contracted by 4.1 percent year-on-year in October 2022 before rising by 7.6 percent in November 2022.If one takes the average for October-November 2023, the Indian economy is performing far better this year, with industrial output up 7.0 percent year-on-year in October-November 2023 compared to a growth of just 1.8 percent in the same two months of 2022.Positives and negativesThis is not to say that there is nothing to learn from today's data.Core inflation, or inflation excluding food and fuel items, continued its journey down south, falling to 3.9 percent in December from 4.1 percent the previous month, as per Moneycontrol's calculations. Reducing core inflation has been a key objective of the Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee. But the continued fall – it stood at 6.1 percent at the start of 2023 – is puzzling to some economists.""Declining core inflation at a time of strong economic growth is a conundrum,"" noted Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist, and Paras Jasrai, senior analyst, of India Ratings & Research.The Indian economy is expected to grow by 7.3 percent in 2023-24, significantly higher than what most economists had predicted.Also Read: RBI model pegs India's FY25 GDP growth at 6.0% vs official view of 6.5%On the production side, of particular concern is the performance of consumer goods, both durable and non-durable. Over October-November, production of consumer durable goods was up 5.3 percent year-on-year, while that of non-durables was just 2.6 percent higher. These numbers compare favourably to October-November 2022, when the production for the two categories of goods was down 6.6 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively.Nevertheless, Sinha and Jasrai of India Ratings are not impressed by the standalone November numbers, which saw the production of durables and non-durables shrink by 5.4 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively. According to them, the weak numbers point to the ""prevalence of the anaemic consumption demand in the economy"".Then there are capital goods, whose output contracted by 1.1 percent after having grown by 21.3 percent in October. While the base effect played a role here, the contraction coincided with a drop in the government's capital expenditure.The Centre's capex is down 9 percent year-on-year in October-November after having jumped 43 percent in the first half of 2023-24."

The sharp slowdown in manufacturing output growth - which accounts for more than three-fourths of the IIP - was down to the holidays in November on account of festivals, which led to a reduction in working hours and, as a consequence, production.However, other sectors too saw a fall in growth, with electricity generation increasing by 5.8 percent as opposed to 20.4 percent in October. Meanwhile, mining output was 6.8 percent higher, down from a growth of 13.1 percent in October.In terms of the use-based classification of goods, production growth in November was lower for all six categories compared to October:>> Primary goods: 8.4 percent versus 11.4 percent in October>> Capital goods: -1.1 percent versus 21.3 percent in October>> Intermediate goods: 3.5 percent versus 9.4 percent in October>> Infrastructure goods: 1.5 percent versus 11.3 percent in October>> Consumer durable goods: -5.4 percent versus 15.9 percent in October>> Consumer non-durable goods: -3.6 percent versus 8.7 percent in OctoberEconomists have been warning for some time that the IIP data will be drastically affected by seasonal factors, with Diwali occurring in November in 2023 and in October in 2022. This causes severe base effects. As such, they have argued that instead of monthly growth numbers, the average for October-November may be a better indicator of ground realities. If the average for the two months is taken, the Indian economy is performing far better now, with industrial output up 7.0 percent year-on-year in October-November 2023 compared to a growth of just 1.8 percent in October-November 2022."

Nevertheless, rate cuts appear distant, and are unlikely to emerge before August, with a stance change expected in the preceding policy meeting,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA."

The finance minister has to balance the desire to be populist ahead of national elections and the need to keep the fiscal maths pristine. For Nirmala Sitharaman, it is no mean task this time, with the fiscal maths already indicating a troubling path ahead.She needs every rupee she can get from taxes and other revenues and must spend wisely to keep the overall fiscal deficit in check. Spending choices are trickier amid a lower nominal economic growth that would fetch less than expected tax revenue growth. The choice conundrum is best explained by Manas Chakravarty in this piece. You will get all the troubles on the fiscal maths by Siddarth Upasani in this story here.Even when the Budget is bombarded with uncertainties, there is one area that the finance minister can bank on, for both revenue and reduction in spending. India’s banks are in their best shape and will remain so this year to give large dividends to their primary shareholder, the government, and would have no need for capital infusion.The growing health of public sector banks over the past two years has meant that the government didn’t need to earmark any funds towards the recapitalisation of the banks it owns. At the same time, public sector lenders and the Reserve Bank of India transferred record profits as dividend to the government. Our Chart of the Day captures this virtuous trend.The past two Budgets did not set aside an amount for recapitalisation, a practice followed every year before that. Indeed, the government had to infuse a massive Rs 2.7 lakh crore over three years into its banks to keep them afloat, a significant burden on the exchequer. This burden no longer exists.Of course, public lenders need to grow and lend for which they need capital. In fact, they are losing market share hand over fist to private banks in the loan market. But the indications are that the government would ask them to tap into the capital markets and most lenders are already raising large chunks of capital from the bond market.Healthy public banks make for a ready balance sheet to lend to the economy and assist the government in invigorating private capex and managing its social schemes. When companies see lenders willing to offer loans at reasonable price, they have one more reason to set up factories and increase capital deployment. Public capex has increased manifold, thanks to the government’s increased spending earmarked in the past budgets. The trend is likely to continue. Sitharaman should get all the help she needs in keeping capex momentum.Of course, all care must be taken not to repeat the past mistakes of the corporate cycle, the seeds of which were sown in unbridled infrastructure lending. On its part, the RBI has ensured that banks remain healthy by nipping risky ventures such as excessive unsecured lending in the bud. The central bank has beefed up its supervisory capacities and intensity to keep an eye on incipient risks. It is not whether Indian firms trust banks to keep themselves shipshape but a matter of whether the government can trust them to not come for help.Investing insights from our research teamTCS Q3 FY24 – Does good execution make it a 'buy'?Infosys Q3 FY24 – Is it a value buy now?Weekly Tactical Pick: This regional jewellery player is set to shineDelta Corp Q3FY24: A weak quarter, multiple headwinds aheadWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Calculator dumps Polycab, Desi Soros switches on Zee, Diamond in the roughBudget 2024: Look beyond sops to energise RE growthBudget 2024: How Indian Railways smartly improved passenger revenuesWill Q3 earnings provide a reality check or cheer investors further?Why PepsiCo’s patent win is no small potatoesTime for a second green revolution, this time a sustainable oneDitch green-shaming for positive effort to achieve sustainability goalsPersonal Finance | Multi-asset funds: Don’t blindly buy the storyReasons to be optimistic in 2024 — despite everything (republished from the FT)Ram Mandir: How much electoral gain can BJP expectThe Silicon Valley Founder-CEO is no longer indispensableWe don't know how worried we should be about nanoplasticsPersonal Finance New to credit?

The government should also come up with a plan for the optimal utilisation for Inland Container Depot (ICD) in six months, the court said, adding it would monitor the implementation of its directions.The case will now likely be heard on July 31.Delhi resident Ajay Khera had filed a plea in the NGT against the pollution created by ICD in Tughlakabad area of the national capital.The ICD was being used by trucks and trailers not heading for Delhi, leading to a huge inflow of heavy diesel vehicles that caused air pollution. There were other ICDs around Delhi and the traffic could be diverted to those depots, he said.In March 2019, NGT passed an order directing CCI to ensure that vehicles stop visiting ICD in Tughlkabad in a phased manner. The company challenged the order in the Supreme Court.The court criticised NGT's direction asking CCI to divert vehicles to the ICDs in Dadri, Rewari, Ballabhgarh and other places.""Such an observation by the NGT is in complete ignorance of the fact that citizens living in other parts of the country other than Delhi NCR also have a fundamental right to a pollution free environment as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India,"" the court said.While protecting the fundamental right of the people of Delhi- NCR, NGT shouldn’t allow infringement of the rights of those living in other places."

Investor expectations are that the robust earnings growth expected in Q3 FY2024 will back this rally.But this is not to say that capital expenditure (capex) in the private sector, especially corporates, is growing at a fiery pace. On the contrary, the share of corporate capex during the first six months of fiscal 2024 (H1 FY2024) declined to a decadal low, points out data in today’s Chart of the Day. Within the private sector, household savings’ share in total investments in the country has grown to partly find its way in investments in residential real estate, translating into growth in sales and utilisation levels in industries such as cement and steel.In other words, corporate and private sector capex, although improving, needs support to sustain and keep the wheel of economic growth turning. What this means is the government may not pull back capex hurriedly in the forthcoming interim Budget. In fact, the share of government capex (Centre and states) grew from about 11 per cent to 16 per cent between the pre-pandemic period and now.The government’s capex, of course, may be biased in favour of roads, railways, defence, ports and green energy that are critical to its stated mission, points out this article.But then, given that the fiscal deficit is much higher than the budgeted 5.9 percent of GDP for 2023-24, it may be a challenge to increase capex. Besides, an interim Budget is usually a populist one, says Manas Chakravarty in this article, where he details the pattern of the 2019 pre-election Budget. This time around too, the government has to balance populist policies, capex to keep up the pace of economic activity that is reckoned to be luring direct investments into the country and fiscal compression.Even from an equity investor stand point, it is important to note that earnings traction must not be mistaken for strong private sector capex. After all, capacity utilisation on the back of high corporate capex in 2017 is yet to rise to optimal levels that justify further investments. Earnings growth in the capital goods and infrastructure segment during FY2024 is more due to a drop in raw material costs rather than revenue growth.Investing insights from our research teamWhat makes SBI Life Insurance a core portfolio stock?Saregama: Long-term story is unchangedTrackerPro Economic Tracker | Power consumption improves, labour participation subduedWhat else are we reading?Bitcoin is here to stay, India should join the partyBudget 2024: Foreign investors to drive Indian equities in 2024Budget 2024: It's time life insurers were weaned away completely from tax crutchesStart-up Street | Budget 2024: Catalysing start-ups growth and investmentIndia’s cold chain infra needs to grow swiftly to smoothen food inflationJapan’s market rally lacks solid backing (republished from the FT)Bangladesh votes for continuity.

Investors turned to this traditional safe haven amid rising inflation, subsequent interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events, seeking a secure investment option.""Higher inflation and subsequent hike in interest rates augured well for gold. Moreover, heightened geopolitical tension triggered due to the war between Israel and Hamas made it an attractive and safe investment destination for investors,"" Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director  Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Research India, said.Vishal Jain, CEO at Zerodha Fund House, said that Indians have had a centuries-long affinity with physical gold while investment products such as Gold ETFs have been slower in terms of adoption.""Over the years, investors' comfort with digitization, ease of access, and a wider palette of products to choose from has been a reason for Gold ETFs becoming an option. Given the volatility we have seen this is a good move given gold is a must-have in every portfolio,"" he added.The inflow played a crucial role in driving the assets under management (AUM) of gold funds up by over 27 per cent, reaching Rs 27,336 crore by the end of December 2023, compared to Rs 21,455 crore a year earlier.Gold, with its superlative performance over the last few years, has garnered substantial investor interest and the consistent increase in folio numbers serves as a testament to its attractiveness.During the year, the folio numbers in gold ETFs saw a notable increase, rising by 2.73 lakh to reach 49.11 lakh in December 2023 from 46.38 lakh in December 2022. This indicates a growing inclination among investors towards funds related to gold.Apart from 2023, gold emerged as one of the better performing asset classes in the challenging investment environment of 2020 and 2021 that was posed by covid and economic downturn. An inflow to the tune of Rs 4,814 crore was seen in the segment during 2021 and Rs 6,657 crore in 2020.""Gold functions as a strategic asset in an investor's portfolio, given its ability to act as an effective diversifier, and alleviate losses during tough market conditions and economic downturns. This is where it draws its safe-haven appeal, "" Morningstar's Srivastava said.In 2023, investors overwhelmingly favoured equities over other asset classes, directing a substantial investment of Rs 1.61 lakh crore. This marked a significant increase compared to the Rs 71,000 crore observed in the preceding year.Also, SIP's (Systematic Investment Plan) flows witnessed a significant rise with investors likely redeeming out of other asset classes in favour of equity funds.Gold ETFs, which aim to track the domestic physical gold price, are passive investment instruments that are based on gold prices and invest in gold bullion.In short, Gold ETFs are units representing physical gold which may be in paper or dematerialised form. One gold ETF unit is equal to 1 gram of gold and is backed by physical gold of very high purity. They combine the flexibility of stock investments and the simplicity of gold investments."

The simplified tax structure under GST has reduced the compliance burden and facilitated a more business-friendly environment. There are a few creases but they can be ironed out in due course,"The introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India on July 1, 2017, marked a significant milestone in the country's economic history. GST replaced a plethora of central and state taxes, aiming to streamline the taxation system to foster economic growth. This reform has left a remarkable impact on the Indian taxation sector, leading to an era of improved efficiency, transparency and simplicity in business operations. Introduction of GST could be said to have given impetus towards the vibrancy of the Indian economy.In the pre-GST regime, the indirect tax structure in India was fragmented. Each state had its own VAT laws to impose taxes on supply of commodities, while the central government imposed taxes on manufacture of goods and provision of services. The levying of taxes at different stages of supply chain led to a cascading effect, resulting in tax burden for consumers. The GST law addressed this issue by providing a seamless credit and uniform tax structure. The simplified tax structure under GST has reduced the compliance burden and facilitated a more business-friendly environment. Elimination of border checkposts has resulted in faster movement of goods across state borders, in line with the government vision of ""One Nation, One Tax"".Surge In GST CollectionUnder the GST regime, 47 lakh taxpayers transitioned from service tax, VAT, and Central Excise frameworks. Currently, there are 1.4 crore registered taxpayers under GST law. Initially, the government's average monthly GST collection ranged from Rs 0.8 to 1.2 lakh crore. However, in fiscal year 2023-24, this average monthly GST collection has surged to Rs. 1.66 lakh crore. This data highlights the substantial growth in both taxpayer numbers and GST revenue since the implementation of GST.In the era of 'Digital India,' technological advancements have played a crucial role in streamlining GST. GST portal features such as auto population of purchase data in recipient GSTINs, integration of e-invoices with GST returns and generation of e-invoices/e-way bills have significantly contributed to the efficiency of the GST system. Additionally, processes such as e-filing of refunds, online appeals have further enhanced the overall functionality of GST.Read | Budget 2024: Small and medium businesses expect clarity, relief on GST"" href=""https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/budget-2024-small-and-medium-businesses-expect-clarity-relief-on-gst-12018731.html"">Budget 2024: Small and medium businesses expect clarity, relief on GSTNotably, the establishment of GST tribunals is a matter that needs attention. However, there are complexities around their formation. During the 52nd GST Council meeting in October 2023, recommendations were proposed to address the appointment of lawyers as judicial members. It was anticipated that the proposed amendment Bill will be presented during the winter session of Parliament in December 2023.GST On GamingIn the gaming sector, there has been a continuing debate on categorisation of games as either 'games of chance' or 'games of skill’. Subsequently, at the 51st GST Council meeting, it was decided to impose a 28% GST on all online games; but the government provided relief to players by clarifying that the GST levy would only apply to the initial deposit amount (real money) and not on the value of each bet from the winning amount.Over the last few months, taxpayers have received multiple GST notices for the financial year 2017-18 and 2018-19, addressing alleged shortfalls in GST payment, the reversal of input tax credit, or the recovery of erroneous refunds. Notices have also been issued on matters involving the interpretation of legal provisions, rulings by the Supreme Court, High Courts, and Advance Ruling Authorities, among others.Amendment To GST LawIn October 2023, the GST Council made specific recommendations to facilitate trade, including the introduction of an amnesty scheme for filing appeals, issuance of clarifications regarding guarantees on loans provided by directors in their personal capacities and by related persons, and the prospective amendment in the GST law to make the input service distributor (ISD) mechanism mandatory for the distribution of input tax credit (ITC) on common services.Also Read | Govt takes stringent action against fraudulent firms, identifies 29,273 bogus entities in GST scam crackdownThere is anticipation that the government will introduce measures to establish more flexible tax-free enclaves within Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Additionally, there is also expectation of clarity on the taxability of virtual digital assets (VDA) and discussions on the applicability of GST on Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPs). Furthermore, it is anticipated that an amnesty scheme under Customs law may be announced. The digitalisation of the Customs litigation processes is also likely to be a part of the Budget discussions.Following the winter session in December 2023, the government will gear up for a two-week ""Interim Budget Session"" of Parliament before the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. The anticipated changes are likely to be dispersed across the interim and final budgets of 2024. Substantial alterations in the GST law are not expected as many are regularly addressed by the GST Council.

Banks and non-bank financial companies “must appraise robustness of models used for lending,” he said.The Reserve Bank of India has tightened restrictions on risky lending in recent months to improve financial stability. In November, it raised the capital cost of unsecured lending by banks, and followed that up by instructing lenders to offload investments in alternate investment funds, or bear hefty provisioning costs against those assets.Das said that some banks and non-bank financial companies didn’t have the bandwidth to manage surge in loans approved by algorithm.“It was very clear to us that this kind of growth would not be sustainable going forward if it is not slightly moderated,” the governor said. “We clearly anticipated some problems ahead of us down the road. Therefore, we acted preemptively.”While the nation’s banking system remains robust and secured, the central bank will remain cautious against any sense of complacency, Das said Thursday.The RBI said last month the bad-debt ratio for Indian banks will likely ease to 3.1% of total loans by September from the current level of 3.2%.FX InterventionThe governor also pushed back against the International Monetary Fund exchange rate regime reclassification. “Some people read it wrongly and call it a stabilized arrangement. But it is not justified, it is market determined.,” Das said.The Washington-based lender last month in its Article IV consultation report said the RBI’s intervention in the foreign-exchange market was excessive, implying that the country was trying to influence the level of the rupee.The rupee weakened 0.6% last year, and traded in the narrowest range since 2002."

India taxes electric vehicles (EVs) at just 5%.","India's trade department has backed lowering taxes on hybrid vehicles to help the transition to cleaner energy sources, following demands by Japanese car makers, five government and industry sources told Reuters.The move could irk some local carmakers.India's combined sales and additional taxes on hybrid vehicles sales are as high as 43%, based on the size of the car, compared with the highest rate of 50% imposed on petrol and diesel cars. India taxes electric vehicles (EVs) at just 5%.""Hybrid vehicles are less polluting than diesel vehicles and there is merit in taxes on hybrid vehicles being somewhere between what's levied on diesel vehicles and electric vehicles,"" one of the government sources, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.The move could boost the prospects in India of Japan's Toyota Motor, the world's largest carmaker, which has been lobbying for months for lower taxes for hybrid cars, arguing such vehicles are far less polluting than petrol cars.According to two government sources, India's trade promotion and industry ministry has asked the heavy industries ministry to ""rationalise cess"" on hybrid cars, two government sources said.Cess is an additional tax typically levied on the sale of products identified as ""luxury goods"" by New Delhi. Cess on hybrid cars goes up to 15% based on the size of the vehicle.The move would eventually need a nod from the ministry of finance. In a letter written last month to Indian heavy industry secretary Kamran Rizvi, the country's trade promotion and industry secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh cited representation by a ""foreign"" carmaker that hybrids attract higher levies than electric vehicles. The letter stated that India needed hybrids and EVs to meet its climate goals and stakeholders should work in sync to meet the targets, a government and an industry official said.The move would, however, be a shift from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government's stance of heavily incentivising EVs. India aims to shift 30% of its fleet by 2030 to electric vehicles. ""Such policy flip-flops will delay the transition to EVs and hurt investment sentiments,"" the industry official said.

Historically, budgets have had a significant impact on the markets as government policies influence private-sector investments.Previous budget measures have helped mitigate the pandemic's impact on private sector balance sheets, resulting in considerable market gains.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is set to present the interim budget on February 1, which is the last before the general elections scheduled to be held by May 2024.Market performance before and after previous budgetsIn the past 11 budgets under the Modi government, the BSE Sensex fell five times and the Nifty dropped on six occasions, while they ended higher at other times.Both the benchmark indices fell five times out of 11 in the three months before the budget presentation. After the budget, the Sensex and Nifty declined over three months five times out of 11.On February 1, 2019, during the interim budget, the Sensex and Nifty yielded just a 0.5% return.Biggest gains for Sensex, Nifty came ahead of 2021 budgetThe indices gained almost 12 percent in the three months before the first budget of the Modi government in July 2014. However, the most significant gains before the budget were observed in 2021, with the Sensex and the Nifty have advanced about 21 percent as the economy emerged from the Covid aftermath and the markets anticipated strong government support.In 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019, there were single-digit returns for the indices before the budget, ranging from 2.3 percent to 6.6 percent. In 2016, three months before the budget, both the Sensex and the Nifty dropped 6.3 percent each. In 2020, 2022, and 2023, they declined by 1.1 percent to 1.9 percent.Three months after the budget in 2020, the Sensex and the Nifty declined over 20 percent due to pandemic restrictions. In 2015, both benchmark indices fell over 5 percent, while in 2019 and 2022, they dropped about 3 percent.The most gains in the three months after the budget were posted in 2017 and 2019, with increases of 6.3 percent, while in 2014, 2016, and 2023, they rose about 3 percent each.What to expect from Budget 2024While a full-fledged budget is expected in July, there's a possibility of populist measures, particularly before the general election.""The current budget is a vote of account, so expecting any major announcement ahead of the forthcoming general elections seems highly unlikely,” said Sharad Chandra Shukla, director at Mehta Equities.Nonetheless, taxpayers are eyeing populist measures such as higher basic and house rent allowance exemptions. Analysts expect a record 25 percent increase in capital expenditure allocation to Rs 12.5 lakh crore in FY25. Market experts want pro-stock market measures including removal or reduction of securities transaction tax and long-term capital gains tax.""Any budget before elections is usually a populist budget, but looking at this government's track record for the last 10 years, we are sure they will focus on business as usual,” said Himanshu Kohli, co-founder of Client Associates.Kohli said the government will stick to its growth- and development-oriented agenda with a focus on inclusive growth in the budget. There could be some short-term announcements to please the public, he said.""There is a high probability that this government can come back to power and then they will present a full-year budget that will lay down detailed plans focusing on the long-term growth momentum of the country. Hence, this is more like an interim budget, which doesn't hold too much value right now. The best agenda for a government is to do what is correct from a long-term rather than a short-term perspective, and this is possible when they present the full-year budget,” Kohli said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

President Toshihiro Suzuki, unveiled investment plans worth more than Rs 2.35 lakh crore on the first day of the Vibrant Gujarat Summit 2024.What’s it about: Over the past two decades, the Vibrant Gujarat Summit has emerged as a global business-networking event to showcase the state’s investment-friendly environment and attracted significant investments into the state. The push has helped Gujarat become one of India’s most preferred investment destinations and fostered partnerships with major global and local corporations.The Prime Minister’s Voice: Addressing delegates at the summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised India’s robust economic growth, saying, “Today, all major agencies estimate that India will be among the top three economies in the world in the coming years. Let people across the world do their analysis, but it is my guarantee that it will happen.”Key announcements: Mukesh Ambani announced Reliance would set up India’s first carbon fibre facility at Hazira in Gujarat.

Expectations for the Budget are modest as the finance minister is slated to present an interim Budget, with no significant announcements expected. However, considerable attention will be directed towards the earnings season.Regrettably, the outlook for Corporate India's performance in the October-December 2023 quarter is less than optimistic. Analysts are forecasting a subdued showing, with both top line and bottom line figures expected to register a decline.The combined net profit of Nifty 50 companies is expected to be the lowest in the past four quarters. The anticipated growth of 13.3 percent in the December quarter will be sharply lower than a 28.6 percent growth in the second and 34.8 percent growth in the first quarter of the current fiscal. The combined revenue of the Nifty 50 companies is expected to be in single digits for the third consecutive quarter.From a record Rs 1.85 lakh crore in Q4 FY23, net profit is likely to fall to Rs 1.73 lakh crore in Q3 FY24.The good news is that operating margins will likely improve, especially for manufacturing companies, because of lower commodity and energy prices. Margins are likely to expand by 186 basis points and touch a 7-quarter high of 19.4 percent.Sectors that are likely to underperform and contribute to the decline are banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), IT, FMCG, and oil and gas. On the other hand, automobile and mining and metal companies are expected to post strong numbers.In an election year, the capital goods and infrastructure sector are expected to show strong performance as government spending tends to increase ahead of the elections. Analysts expect 11-16 percent revenue growth with a strong multi-year high order book and modest margin improvement and are likely to see earnings improve by 30 percent during the quarter.Results of the top IT companies will kick off the earnings season. No fireworks are expected from the frontline companies during the October-December lean quarter. Top companies may post a marginal decline in their revenue and a slight growth in net profit. The key variables to watch out for in the management commentary would be deal momentum, hiring trends, and the impact of new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI).As a result of an expected drop in earnings, brokerages have cut down their forward earnings estimates for the Nifty by around 2 percent to Rs 976 for FY24, registering a growth of 21 percent.While the drop in earnings is not significant, there may be some correction in the market if the actual numbers are lower than analysts' expectations.However, the main action in the market is in stocks out of the benchmark indices. Small and mid-cap stocks have performed far better than benchmark indices and continue to do well. Market participants would be more keen on watching the performance of the smaller companies, and a slowdown there would have a meaningful impact on the market.Investing insights from our research teamDiscovery Series | Sky Gold: Add this jewel to your portfolioBudget 2024: Off-radar agrochem may find policy priority in coming quartersAarti Industries: Sequential improvements support investment caseWhat else are we reading?Budget Snapshot: More misses than hits in disinvestment target Can the Budget lift demand for affordable housing?Chart of the Day | Sugar bends down global food inflation curveRed Sea attacks have started to hurtThe first half of 2024 will be crucial for the financial sectorDeposits, margins to keep banks busy in 2024India-US TPF must take steps that yield quick resultsStrong gains by newly listed stocks raise hopes of IPO market revival(republished from the FT)Budget 2024: Indian economy in relative comfort, but seize the reform opportunitiesPersonal Finance: Deciding between buy-and-hold, booking profitsWhat improving border infrastructure says about India's Deterrence PostureA hidden hero will drive South Korean trade closer to the USAustralia: The danger of talking down immigrationMarketsRate cuts in 2024 would be a mistake, believes this market veteran.

327,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/australia-the-danger-of-talking-down-immigration-12027611.html,Australia: The danger of talking down immigration,"January 10, 2024 12:19 PM IST","The present kerfuffle over immigration is an argument about whether Australians want a country that is big in numbers as well as landmass, and an economy that continues its march up the world tables or just drifts around, ultimately slipping outside the Group of 20, membership of which Australia has often prided itself","Pre-pandemic Australia looks like hallowed ground that the contemporary economy will struggle to surpass. For local officials who aspire to take a crack at emulating a celebrated decades-long expansion, it’s important not to downgrade a vital component that's become radioactive: immigration. The country's politicians are showing a worrying lapse in memory.As much as any other factor, population growth contributed to the 30-year stretch without a recession that ended in 2020. The country's performance was “flattered,” in the words of former Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe, by rising headcount. A mining boom fueled by China's go-go years, the dramatic economic reforms of the 1980s — and some luck — have tended to get the credit. This misses a fundamental ingredient, and it’s too bad.Aussies loved the attention that came with that dream economic run, a happy state that was feted by think tanks and idealised in the corridors of the Federal Reserve. (There was also an unhealthy degree of back-patting at home.)  Will that golden era be replicated in the post-Covid world?For starters, current leaders need the stomach to stare down one of the country's outbursts of populist aversion to rising numbers of arrivals. Wrestling with a mid-term slump in opinion polls, the center-left Labor government recently declared it wants substantial cuts. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledged to crack down on student visas and tighten conditions for temporary visas available to skilled migrants. It's not long ago that employers were crying out for talent from abroad. Border restrictions during the pandemic slowed immigration, as they did in many countries. Shortages needed to be alleviated.Some desire to recalibrate is understandable. There has been a big intake: In the last fiscal year to June 30, there were 518,000 new arrivals, according to the Centre for Population in Canberra. The increase was the most on record. The population has climbed greatly over the decades, almost doubling since 1980 to approach 27 million. There is an inevitable strain on resources. Contrary to images of outback ruggedness popular in books and films, Australia is one of the most urbanised societies. Most residents are crammed into a handful of cities along the southeast  coastline. Backlash flares from time to time, some of it nativist and emanating from right-wing talk radio. The surge has been blamed for squeezing an already tight housing market that has seen rents soar in the major cities. Other arguments reflect genuine concern about environmental strain.What's troubling about this current retreat is the electoral environment in which it is happening. Albanese's administration has been on the defensive for months. There's a sense that it's lost momentum since a referendum on constitutional recognition for indigenous Australians flopped in October. The prime minister campaigned hard for that initiative, and his team seems to be flailing around in the aftermath of defeat. They are unnerved by a slide in approval, a perfect backdrop for populist attacks on immigration to hurt. “We’ve got to make sure that our population is sustainable,” Albanese said in December. “What I want to see is a system that works for Australia.”When officials talk about population, they really mean immigration. Like just about every advanced economy, and quite a few emerging markets, couples Down Under aren't having nearly enough kids to keep numbers steady. This doesn’t get enough attention. The fertility rate of 1.58 children per woman is well below the generally recognized replacement level of 2.1. While Australia’s total fertility rate is fairly high in a region where birthrates are retreating at a rapid clip, the trend is similar. In 1961, Australia’s TFR was 3.5. The present kerfuffle is an argument about whether Australians want a country that is big in numbers as well as landmass, and an economy that continues its march up the world tables or just drifts around, ultimately slipping outside the Group of 20, membership of which Australia has often prided itself.You hear very little of this in popular discourse. Albanese has been cowed into adopting the language of the Right, using the word “broken” to describe the immigration program. It begs the question: Was it ever “whole,” and, if so, what did that look like? It’s never been entirely free of controversy. That isn’t the same as saying there aren’t broad merits. Over the decades, a wide-ranging immigration program has transformed, mostly for the better, Australian cultural and economic life.Also buffeting Labor and getting in the way of a nuanced conversation is the High Court-ordered release of long-term detainees. (Under strict policies that date to the early 2000s, thousands of asylum seekers arriving by boat have been sent to detention centers.) Some of those released had been charged with violent crimes, but couldn't be deported due to concerns about persecution, and possibly death sentences, in their countries of origin. The court makes decisions independently, but the government is paying the political price. As will the economy.It's a shame Albanese is spooked. Immigration was enshrined in post-World War II development by the Labor governments of John Curtin and Ben Chifley. Leaders spoke of the need to “populate or perish,” a slogan that was in part a residual fear of invasion, but also a recognition that a new Australia with different macro-economic and strategic settings had to emerge from the conflict.Immigration at that time meant, initially, the UK. It was then broadened to include the Baltic states, the Mediterranean, and the rest of Europe. Race was still relevant: The so-called White Australia Policy endured in practice until the 1970s. After the Vietnam War, newcomers from Indo-China were welcomed. To the credit of conservative leaders in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, immigration retained broad bipartisan support.It would be very unfortunate if a return to pseudo-normality after Covid spelled the demise of a true Australian success story.

Yet it was the nation’s forgotten automotive sector that softened the blow and brought outbound trade to the US to within a whisker of overtaking China. As demand for electric vehicles continues to grow, expect this relationship among long-standing allies to deepen.Semiconductors have long been a mainstay of South Korea’s economy, but much of those are sent to China and Southeast Asia, where they’re assembled into electronics devices from smartphones to computers, and then shipped back overseas to final customers across the globe. This flow of components slumped last year, and overseas sales of chips dropped 24 percent. Cars and machinery are helping fill the void.A 20 percent drop in total exports to China, the biggest destination for South Korean goods, was offset by a 31 percent rise in foreign auto sales. Demand for EVs and high-performance SUVs were the chief driver of a 5.4 percent rise in exports to the US. (China buys very few cars from its neighbour.)All up, the US is fast catching up to China as a destination for South Korean goods, lagging by just 1.4 percentage points last year.There’s a lot more going on beyond the numbers. A possible rebound in the global economy this year, including an uptick in the memory chip sector, suggests South Korean exports to China will resume their upward trajectory, while weakness in EVs could hurt trade with the US. But that’s in the short-term.In the long term, US demand for new-energy vehicles is a trend that can only be slowed, but not halted, by temporary headwinds such as rising interest rates and tweaks to government subsidies.A supporting character in the Asian nation’s export recovery will be machinery. South Korean sales to America of equipment used in manufacturing rose 25 percent last year. That growth is likely to continue as Washington rolls out policies — including raising tariffs and boosting incentives — in order to have more products like steel, renewable power plants, and cars made in the US.American automakers won’t account for all of the growing EV pie. Likewise, geopolitical tensions mean Chinese manufacturers like BYD Co are unlikely to gain much of a foothold in the US if they even try to enter the market, in part because they already face an import duty of around 25 percent. New rules on tax credits for EVs further diminish the competitiveness of models which are fully or partly sourced from China.That leaves Europeans, Japanese and South Koreans to fill the gap. In traditional vehicles, Japan is the standout leader. Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co remain dominant players alongside locals Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co. But they don’t hold a strong position in EVs — everyone is playing catchup to Tesla Inc.Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Corp are seizing that opportunity. South Korean EV sales to the US climbed 60 percent last year, according to data from the ministry of trade, industry and energy, and were up five-fold over the figure posted in 2021.The US will also lean on it for batteries, machinery and auto parts as Washington drives new policies aimed at ensuring a greater share of new-energy cars are made on home soil.For more than 70 years, Seoul and Washington have been close military and political allies. In the coming decade, trade will start to become an equally important part of the relationship.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

The government HAS a 90 percent stake in the PSU.,"India’s Commerce and Industry ministry has approved the closure of State Trading Corporation of India Limited (STC), a Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) under its administrative control, a senior government official told Moneycontrol.“STC is already approved for closure,” the official told Moneycontrol. After the Commerce Ministry’s approval, the closure will now be discussed by the alternative mechanism (AM) for a final go-ahead. The AM is a panel of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Minister of Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari and the minister from the line ministry, which in STC’s case is Piyush Goyal. Instead of the cabinet, the AM (alternative mechanism) is empowered to make a decision on matters relating to winding up of PSUs.The government currently holds a 90 percent stake in STC and thus also falls well short of the minimum public shareholding norm, wherein a listed company must have a public stake of 25 percent.Closure of PSUs is more difficult than disinvestment as it leads to huge job losses, the official said. The government has approved the closure of about 21 loss-making PSUs but very few closures have been completed.Once the AM approves the closure of STC, the Finance Ministry’s Department of Public Enterprises will step in. The DPE looks at the process for closure of PSUs.In 2019, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had said that STC should be shut as it had bad loans with banks due to non-payment. The merger of MMTC and STC was also considered but was not pursued.The Centre had offloaded a 1.02 percent stake in STC in 2013 through the Offer For Sale (OFS) route after approval from Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).STC was established in 1956 to oversee various imports and exports. The government had earlier assessed the need for these canalising agencies in the Department of Commerce and found them to be unnecessary. Canalising agency refers to the channelling of imports and exports through a designated product-specific enterprise.The financialsIn terms of earnings, STC reported zero revenue in FY22 and FY23 as its business activities had been suspended since November 2020, as directed by the ministry. However, in FY23, it reported a net profit of Rs 32.89 crore, a turnaround from a net loss of Rs 93.97 crore in FY22. This was primarily due to increased rental income and reduced operating costs, including a reduction in manpower. Before FY23, the company had experienced losses from FY14 to FY22. As of March 31, 2023, STC had a negative net worth of Rs 1,028.67 crore, and accumulated losses of Rs 1,156.04 crore.According to its annual report for FY23, STC is working with lender banks to finalise a One Time Settlement (OTS) of their outstanding dues. STC has paid Rs 1,100 crore to lenders, and identified immovable properties worth around Rs 300 crore are to be transferred to the banks as part of the OTS.However, there have been deviations from the original terms of the OTS agreed upon during the 2019 meeting, leading to delays in concluding the OTS. A case filed by a consortium of lender banks is ongoing in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT). The last DRT hearing was on July 26, last year."

With a 24 percent on-year surge in prices, pulses too added to the cost.The cost of making a vegetarian plate of food in December 2022, as per CRISIL, was Rs 26.6.While vegetarians suffered from the rising vegetable prices in 2023, non-vegetarians had some reason to celebrate as the cost of a non-veg thali was down 4 percent year-on-year last month to Rs 57.6, driven by a 15 percent slump in chicken prices due to higher production.CRISIL's calculations assume a veg thali comprising roti, vegetables (onion, tomato, and potato), rice, dal, curd, and salad. A non-veg thali is the same as a veg thali, but with chicken replacing dal. The amount of each item in the thali is not changed depending on how prices of food items move in the market.Also Read: Steady progress on inflation, but next steps are crucialThe latest thali prices come just ahead of the statistics ministry releasing the headline retail inflation data for December on January 12, with economists predicting inflation rose closer to the upper bound of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) 2-6 percent tolerance range from 5.55 percent in November.In a separate note published on January 9, CRISIL economists said that while 'inflation anxiety' decreased over the course of 2023, it was higher compared to 2018-2021, as per Google Trends data.Using the Google Trends index based on searches for 'inflation', which is found to be strongly correlated with households' inflation expectations as per the RBI's own survey, CRISIL economists said that spike in search interest for onion and tomato prices has moderated, which suggested ""anxiety is cooling off"".""Easing inflation anxiety about TOP (tomato, onion, potato) prices and cooling of non-food inflation has brought some relief at the end of the calendar year. But edgy vegetable prices, elevated food-grain inflation and the now-recurring weather worries are keeping inflation concerns on the boil. The repeated flare-ups are a reminder that as long as food prices remain high and volatile, they will continue to influence headline inflation and, consequently, monetary policy,"" they noted."

Thai white rice 5% broken — an Asian benchmark — rallied to a fresh 15-year high at the end of last year of $659 a ton.“We know rice markets will remain tight for the foreseeable future, largely due to India’s export ban,” according to Peter Clubb, a commodities market analyst at the International Grains Council in London. “We also have Eid coming up in April, and the period before Eid tends to see good demand from markets with significant Muslim populations in Asia and Africa.”Top shipper India is expected to keep its export restrictions in place until at least a general election in April or May, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to contain local prices before voters head to the polls. The onset of El Niño and its potential impact on key growing areas has added to supply concerns.Nations across Asia and Africa have scrambled to secure supply since India ramped up its restrictions in July. Rice inflation in the Philippines has surged, while Indonesia has asked its military to help farmers boost output. The nation is a major importer and is gearing up for a presidential election next month.Still, prices are unlikely to revisit the 2008 record above $1,000 a ton, which coincided with broader export bans. Farmers in Vietnam’s Mekong Delta could start harvesting their new crop this month, alleviating some supply concerns. The winter-spring harvest typically yields the nation’s biggest crop.Thailand’s rice exporters association, which sets Thai white 5% broken prices, also expects the nation’s exports to drop this year as demand eases, most notably from Indonesia following its election.

Banning banks and NBFCs from investing in Alternative Investment Funds on suspicion, often baseless, of evergreening of loans is creating artificial funds crunch. Instead pursue proactive disclosures of loans from AIFs  and audit committee scrutiny of investments in AIFs  ","Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (the “RBI”) issued a circular restricting Regulated Entities (“REs”), including banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (“NBFCs”), from making investments in Alternative Investment Funds (“AIFs”) that, in turn, have investments in debtor companies. A debtor company is one in which the RE currently has or, during the preceding 12 months, had a loan or investment exposure. The circular aims to address concerns relating to the possible evergreening of loans to borrowers through AIFs.Evergreen loans simply refer to endless loans.  In some cases, REs have been taking minority stakes in AIFs, and AIFs have used the invested capital to subscribe to debentures or other instruments of debtor companies. The funds so received by the debtor companies are used to repay the earlier unpaid loans of REs. This helps REs show a lower percentage of Non-Performing Assets in their books.Some of the key and onerous aspects of the circular are:1] REs must not make an investment in any scheme of an AIF, which plans to make or has made downstream investments either, directly or indirectly, in a debtor company of the RE.2] If an AIF scheme, in which an RE is already an investor, makes a downstream investment in any debtor company, then the RE must liquidate its investment in the scheme within thirty (30) days from the date of the downstream investment by the AIF.Read: RBI bars lenders from investing in AIFs linked to borrowing companies3] If the RE is unable to liquidate its investment in such AIF scheme within thirty (30) days, it must make a 100% provision on such investment in its books of accounts.4] An investment by an RE in subordinated units of an AIF scheme with a “priority distribution model” will lead to a full deduction from the RE’s capital. “Priority distribution model” refers to an AIF’s adoption of a distribution waterfall that allows a class of investors to share losses more than pro rata to their holdings in the AIF when compared to other investors.Following the circular, many NBFCs have started to make the necessary provisions in their books. Moreover, funding to NBFCs is also being scrutinised in more detail, and there are fears that some NBFCs may have to shut shop as funding may dry up.Also Read : Explained | Why the RBI barred lenders from investing in AIFs linked to borrower companies Although the circular aims at curbing evergreening of loans, it seems to be painting all debtor companies with one broad brush stroke. Companies often seek to retire higher interest loans with lower interest ones in order to reduce their interest outflow. Many Indian companies have been raising funds through external commercial borrowings (although rates abroad have also risen) to retire more expensive Indian loans. Although the RBI’s move is well intended and seeks to eliminate fraudulent transactions, prohibiting any exposure by REs to AIFs invested in “debtor companies” will result in collateral damage for AIFs in general.  AIFs are already seeing a funding crunch on this count.Further discussion needs to be had with the stakeholders and more precise guard rails need to be put in place by the RBI. Rather than have a carte blanche ban, the audit committees of the REs should be tasked with assessing whether an investment in an AIF is for bona fide business purposes or to evergreen a loan. Adequate disclosures should be made to the stock exchanges if loans are being taken by debtor companies from AIFs to ensure transparency and integrity of the financial system. A collaborative approach rather than a ban will aid the debt markets significantly.Akil Hirani is Managing Partner, Majmudar & Partners, India.

Assets under management in the industry rose to Rs 50.8 lakh crore, up 27 percent from December 2022. Investors retained their faith in the equity markets despite a flare-up of geopolitical tensions and a moderation in growth rates in some sectors.Systematic investment plans saw a record 40.32 lakh registrations in December 2023, a quantum jump from December 2022. Inflows into equity mutual funds remained strong, supported by the launch of new mutual fund schemes. The small cap and mid cap mutual funds together received as much as 40 percent of the equity fund flows in calendar year 2023, significantly higher than in 2022.The increased awareness among investors about stock market investing is driving inflows into mutual funds. As such, the relatively stable macroeconomic scenario of India and steady earnings growth remain a major attraction for investors. So much so that domestic institutional investors, boosted by large investor flows, have emerged as a stable counterweight to volatile foreign fund flows.Analysts expect the positive momentum in mutual fund inflows to continue, supported by a pause in interest rate hikes by central banks and continued financialisation of savings.However, investors should be wary of valuations, especially in mid cap stocks. “A key concern for Indian equities currently emanates from the high exuberance in mid/small caps, which will limit their prospective returns vis-à-vis large caps,” warn analysts at ICICI Securities.The 20 times one-year forward price to earnings multiple of the Nifty 50 index may seem reasonable despite the influx of fund flows into equity markets that tends to inflate valuations.But valuations are pricing in a rosy earnings scenario and therefore, warrant caution. Initial estimates indicate a moderation in Nifty 50 index earnings in FY25 vis-à-vis the growth rate in FY24. Investors should watch out for unforeseen events that can dent investor sentiments or earnings projections. The upcoming earnings season will provide important cues for investors.Investing insights from our research teamWill Persistent Systems remain the winner in 2024?Jyoti CNC Automation IPO: Is it too costly for the promises?GM Breweries Q3: Decent business with high margin of safetyWhat else are we reading?Budget Snapshot | Benign raw material prices to keep fertiliser subsidy bill in checkWhy short sellers are a boon and not a bane for marketsIndia's higher rankings in MSCI EM index could import volatilityMarketing Musings: Lakshadweep’s natural beauty needs to be marketed well to become an alternative to MaldivesWill India’s dreams in semiconductors come to fruition?Consumer premiumisation is sweeping small town IndiaThe EU’s carbon border tax and the fragmentation of global trade (republished from the FT)Budget 2024: Focus on growth to protect against global headwindsThe year of the bull or the bear?

Activity from foreign investors remained subdued for most of this period due to global geopolitical uncertainties and a high interest rate environment, the report noted.The report said that the share of top 10 deals was 87 percent of the total value of PE investments in first nine months of FY24 and average ticket size marginally increased to $95 million in 9M FY24 from $91 million in 9M FY23.The marginal increase in average ticket size was largely due to a large deal in which Brookfield India Real Estate Trust REIT and Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund GIC together acquired two commercial assets - one in Mumbai and the other in Gurugram in NCR, from Brookfield Asset Management with an enterprise value of $1.4 billion, the report highlighted.Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) led with investments of $694 million in first nine months of FY24, against $375 million in the corresponding period in FY23. Investments by foreign investors rose to 86 percent in 9M FY24 against 79 percent in 9M FY23. Correspondingly, domestic investments decreased to 14 percent of the total capital inflows into Indian real estate in 9M FY24 at $360 million, compared to $717 million in 9M FY23.Also Read: Real estate sector saw investments worth $43.3 billion in four yearsShobhit Agarwal, MD and CEO - ANAROCK Capital, says, ""Domestic alternate investment funds (AIFs) have seen lower activity levels as their favoured asset class – residential real estate debt – witnessed lower demand for high-cost funds. Strong residential pre-sales and an accommodative stance by state-owned banks have led to reduced demand for capital from the more expensive AIFs.""The report also stated that April-December period of FY24 saw a robust performance in the commercial office space, particularly in the top six cities. The sector’s reliance on IT/ITeS has diminished, with manufacturing, BFSI, and co-working contributing to the resilient demand. Growth in the IT/ITES sector is expected as more employees shift to working from offices for 3-4 days a week.On a quarterly basis, the rental landscape displayed positive momentum, with most micro-markets experiencing increases of 0-5%.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled Municipal Corporation in Ghaziabad may finally pass a motion to rename the city. There have been campaigns for years to reclaim the linkage of Ghaziabad with Hastinapur of Mahabharata fame.Saffron CitadelGhaziabad has old links with BJP. After BJP decided to ride the Ram Janmabhoomi movement, Ghaziabad gave a vote of confidence to the saffron outfit. The BJP won all the Lok Sabha elections which were held in the 1990s. The BJP leader Ramesh Chand Tomar firmly established the saffron flag in the city.One of the largest parliamentary constituencies in the country, Ghaziabad became the place of calling for Rajnath Singh, Union Minister for Defence, and former Army chief Gen (Retd) VK Singh when they contested Lok Sabha polls. Both of them won their elections with record margins.Mahabharata LinkageSome local activists, including the priest of a temple in the city, led the demands for establishing its linkage with Hastinapur through renaming. Dudheshwar Nath Temple is a prominent shrine here. The priest of this temple built a popular narrative that Ghaziabad was a forested area, infested with wild elephants, in the Hastinapur kingdom of Mahabharata fame. Subsequently, he and others led the demand to rename Ghaziabad as Gajpura (Gaj is elephant). There has also been demand to rename the city as Harnandinagar after the Hindon River.Shedding Crime Den ImageThe 2013 Hindi film “Zila Ghaziabad” brought widespread attention to the city as the backyard of Uttar Pradesh’s crime world. The film essayed tales of gangsters who allegedly ruled the city. Then came a web series further amplifying the image of Ghaziabad in the negative sense, giving a sense that the city is a hunting ground for the criminals. This has led to yearning among city residents to somehow shed the image of a city of gangsters.Noida’s Poor SiblingGhaziabad and Noida are separated by the National Highway 24, which is now named Delhi-Meerut Expressway. The two cities are immediate neighbours of Delhi. While Noida is closer to the well-off parts of Delhi, Ghaziabad has proximity to the politically sensitive areas of the national capital. The people in Ghaziabad often lament that the city is a poor sibling of Noida. This is largely on account of perceived notions among residents that Noida got more attention from the UP government than Ghaziabad in the past.Missing The Economic BoomThe economic boom following the new economic reforms in the early 1990s brought scores of new businesses to Gurugram, Haryana, and Noida, Uttar Pradesh. Even Faridabad in Haryana saw rapid industrialisation. But Ghaziabad somehow missed the bus. The new-age businesses skipped the Ghaziabad landscape. The industrial base of Ghaziabad largely consists of the old businesses of metal works, liquor, timber, and others.Gaining Lucknow AttentionNoida is seen to be attracting businesses even from Gurugram because of its infrastructure and availability of office space. Noida was lavished with attention during the Mayawati administration (2007-12), and now Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is paying keen interest to promote ‘Toy City’, ‘Film City’, Data Centre City’, and others in Noida.Name Changing SpreeGhaziabad may join the likes of Allahabad, Mughalsarai, and Faizabad if the moves in the municipal corporation succeed in renaming the city. Moreover, the action is also actively endorsed by the state government. With the BJP at the helm in the state, Allahabad, where the Kumbh Mela is held, was renamed Prayagraj. Mughalsarai, adjoining Varanasi, was also renamed after the leading ideologue of the BJP, Deen Dayal Upadhyay. In the run-up to the inauguration of the Ram Temple, Faizabad was renamed Ayodhya. It may be noted that Ayodhya was a town in the Faizabad district.There are moves afoot to rename Aligarh also. Aligarh is a big centre of education for the Muslim community. The name-changing spree in UP is in line with the political fervor within the BJP to shed linkages to Muslim rules. Even in Delhi, a few of the roads were renamed to shed such linkages. One such prominent name change was of Aurangzeb Road, which was renamed after former President APJ Abdul Kalam.Eying Economic GainsThe name change alone may not bring an economic windfall to Ghaziabad. But the city may definitely aspire for the spillover effects from Noida in gaining new businesses. Noida’s rapid gains on economic fronts were on account of infrastructure. Wide roads, spacious town planning, and effective administration and action by the Noida Authority against land grabbers and encroachment helped the city take the lead. Ghaziabad may have to do more than renaming to gain on the economic fronts.Administrative ChallengesThe UP government will indeed have to incur additional financial and manpower costs to give effect to the change of the name of Ghaziabad. BJP leaders dismiss the cost factor, claiming that the emotional gains far outweigh the expenditure which may be incurred in the changes of signages and other records. Also, the administration may have to brace for litigation as opponents may challenge the move in courts as has been the case with Prayagraj.Hindutva AssertionThe renaming of Ghaziabad is seen within BJP as long overdue, for the city has a place of political eminence in the western parts of Uttar Pradesh. BJP may hope to cash in on the consequent polarisation in the western parts of UP where the party may have to face up to the challenge of Dalit-Muslim vote consolidation.Manish Anand is a senior Delhi-based journalist.

Right now, the biggest benefit is to fill Chinese carriers’ demand for planes allowing other countries to soak up Boeing and Airbus output with the industry awaiting delivery of hundreds of aircraft","For more than a decade, China’s state-owned aircraft manufacturer has plugged away at developing commercial jets. Until recently, efforts to sell foreign customers on an alternative to the US-European duopoly of Boeing Co. and Airbus SE showed little progress. Then the American giant messed up again.The blowout of a side panel in a 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines starts to make Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd. look like an option worth exploring. Airlines tend to share orders between Airbus and Boeing to ensure they’re not entirely reliant on one supplier and to play the manufacturers off against each other. With the latest troubles, a third choice makes sense. Better known as Comac, the Shanghai-based company has already secured more than 1,000 orders, but they’re largely from domestic customers like China Eastern Airlines Corp.Foreign operators have stuck with Boeing and Airbus for decades, largely because the two are known entities and airlines are risk averse when it comes to shelling out billions of dollars for the single most-important piece of equipment required to run their businesses. New entrants tend to fail because the cost of developing a new plane from scratch is sky high, while customers and investors are unlikely to pony up the capital needed until a proven product can be demonstrated.Like its Western counterparts, Comac has benefited from government support and guaranteed orders from state-backed airlines. With funding secured, all Comac needed to do was build a viable and reliable plane. It took a while, but its C919 — a counterpart to A320 and Boeing 737 jets — finally went into commercial service in May last year. Now, it’s plying theShanghai-Chengdu route for China Eastern and the carrier has since upped its order. From an initial five, the company in September announced it would buy a further 100, worth $9.9 billion at list prices.It’s unlikely that major Boeing customers like United Airlines Holdings Inc, Ryanair Holdings Plc or Emirates Airline will be dropping the Arlington, Virginia-based manufacturer in favor of Comac anytime soon. But a key advantage that had secured the American aerospace firm’s market position — safety and reliability — is starting to look weak.The past five years have proven expensive for Boeing’s clients. The cost of grounding 737 Max aircraft after fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 was, ironically, ameliorated by the Covid pandemic that halted most flights. Had the industry been in full swing after those tragedies, the impact of being unable to generate revenue from dozens of planes — and the slowed delivery of new aircraft — would have been much worse. The aerospace industry has experienced incredible progress in making flying safer because all players have largely been honest about finding and rectifying problems.That’s why the revenue hit to airlines pales in comparison to Boeing’smisdirection, including charges of fraud and manipulation of tests for the 737 Max. Comac is so new as to have no track record. It will take at least a decade, hundreds of aircraft in service, and millions of flight hours to get a picture of whether this new competitor stacks up.It’s very easy to dismiss the Chinese manufacturer because of a perception that its jets may not be safe. A long history of stealing foreign secrets in furtherance of aerospace development bolstered the case for staying clear. Yet it’s also worth asking whether major US contractors deserve legal protection for intellectual property when some of those same players have failed in their duty to keep the aviation public safe — not just over American skies, but across the globe.So far, Comac doesn’t even have the production capacity to match its older rivals. In the short term, Ryanair Chief Executive Officer Michael O’Leary told Simple Flying, the biggest benefit its entry brings to Western airlines is to fill Chinese carriers’ demand for planes. That allows the rest of the world to soak up Boeing and Airbus output at a time when the industry awaits the delivery of hundreds of aircraft.For the long term, though, Comac is already making progress. Rather than touting massive orders from global carriers, it’s quietly picking up smaller, lesser-known airlines — using those as a proving ground. Indonesian low-cost operator PT Transnusa Aviation Mandiri — known as TransNusa — was the first foreign carrier to sign up when it ordered 30 of the smaller ARJ21 jets in 2021. Last year, Brunei-based GallopAir became the debut overseas client for the C919. Tibet Airlines subsequently agreed to work with Comac to develop a version of the C919 for mountainous airports.Such orders don’t amount to much, now. But as Boeing chief Dave Calhoun said in October, “This is a complex, long-cycle business and enduring change takes time.” Indeed, change is afoot, and it may end up happening faster than the Western giants expect.Tim Culpan is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

This was a 31 percent spike over November and a 73.5 percent surge over the last year.A consistent 30 lakh fresh additions every month since July has driven the SIP registrations for FY24 above the the combined figure for FY23 and FY22, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI). Between April and December 2023, there were 2.85 crore new registrations, surpassing the totals of 2.51 crore and 2.66 crore for the entire FY23 and FY22 respectively.Analysts said the surge in SIP registrations reflect a reinforced confidence among investors in India's macroeconomic fundamentals and hopes of potential interest rate cuts by the central banks this year. The BJP-led NDA sweep in the recent state elections in Hindi heartland also boosted faith in continuation of policies of the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre after the general elections around May this year.If the Modi-led NDA regime returns to power for a third straight time, analysts feel, the conducive government policies will help the Indian economy stay the course to reach its $5-trillion goal. Several brokerages recently raised the Nifty targets for 2024. Nomura sees the benchmark index at 24,260 by the end of 2024, while ICICI Direct forecasts Sensex at 83,000 and the Nifty at 25,000.On the flip side, discontinued SIP accounts or completed tenures increased in December 2023, with 20.8 lakh investors withdrawing funds. In FY24 so far, some 1.64 crore investors terminated their SIPs, compared to 1.43 crore in FY23 and 1.11 crore in FY22.According to Jean Christophe Gougeon, director and chief marketing officer, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the growth of SIPs vis-à-vis the discontinuation can be attributed to new offerings in mutual funds due to the entry of new players with fresh ideas and features. Additionally, there are many young entrants in the market who look to make quick returns and hence move out if they don’t get the desired performance. ""However, it is encouraging to see the investors who understand and appreciate the importance of adopting a disciplined approach towards investing via SIP,"" he said.In December, open-ended scheme assets hit Rs 50.80 trillion from Rs 48.78 trillion a month back and analysts expect it is well on track to achieve the targeted aim of Rs 100 lakh crore in the next few years. SIP inflows rose to Rs 17,610 crore in December from Rs 17,073 crore, showing the confidence in retail investors. Small Cap funds gained Rs 3,858 crore, while midcap fund inflows dropped 48 percent. Large Cap funds faced Rs 281 crore net outflows.Read: After JPMorgan, Indian govt bonds could become part of Bloomberg indices in 2024Analysts said most investors don't choose perpetual SIPs, contributing to the increasing trend in SIP discontinuations. However, the rising number of new SIP registrations signifies a growing preference for disciplined investment. Increased inflows through SIPs demonstrate investors' trust in this approach. With markets at all-time highs, sticking to SIPs rather than lump-sum investments indicates a prudent approach and highlights the growing awareness among investors.""Addition of SIPs reflects new investors joining the equity bandwagon and betting first on the proven way to create wealth i.e. SIP. Also, some older investors may be adding SIPs in the midcap and smallcap category going by the way the NAVs of such schemes have risen lately,"" said Deepak Jasani, analysts with HDFC Securities.Jasani cited various reasons behind discontinuance of SIPs. These include end of tenure, lack of funds, underperformance of schemes, lack of funds on payment dates, SIPs closed a few months after they were opened to oblige some RM or friend, booking profit in fear of correction in the markets, NAVs of invested schemes above the average cost of entry and providing a small return etc.Read: Leadership churn at Swiggy continues, Instamart VP Sidharth Satpathy quitsRecently, data from the Central Depository Service and National Securities Depository showed a surge in new investors opening demat accounts, with December posting the highest ever monthly additions.

Like the Bloomberg proposal, the inclusion of Indian debt into JPMorgan's indices will be over several months.However, Bloomberg's proposal does not suggest India's inclusion into its key Bloomberg Global Aggregate and related indices. The index provider added that it will ""continue to monitor related market developments"".As part of its consultation process, Bloomberg has asked users of its indices two questions: whether they agree with the proposal to include eligible Indian bonds in the EM Local Currency Indices and if they agree with their inclusion over five months starting September 2024.Users have been asked to submit their responses by January 25.""While this change is targeted for implementation effective September 2024, further information on the implementation date will be provided after the end of the consultation period... The survey may result in no changes or outcome,"" Bloomberg added.The inclusion of Indian government bonds in global indices is expected to bring billions of dollars of foreign money into the domestic sovereign debt market.

Vessels with a combined tonnage of about 2.5 million gross tons passed through in the week to Jan. 3, compared with about 4m tons at the start of last month, they said.Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi militants have targeted vessels transiting through the Red Sea with missiles in recent weeks. The Houthis say they are going after any vessels that have a connection with Israel.For India, the Red Sea is a major route for shipping to Europe, the US East Coast, the Middle East and African countries. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government is in discussions with export promotion councils to find ways to protect trade transiting through the route, according to two officials familiar with the matter.Last week, India sent a warship to the Arabian Sea where a Liberian-flagged vessel said it was hijacked near Somalia’s coast. The Indian Navy said it “successfully rescued” the ship.“In many cases, both buyers and exporters are also renegotiating contracts to adjust to surging freight charges,” he said.The spot rate for shipping goods in a 40-foot container from Asia to northern Europe now tops $4,000, a 173% jump from just before the diversions started in mid-December, Freightos.com, a cargo booking and payment platform, said Wednesday. Rates from Asia to North America’s East Coast have risen 55% to $3,900 for a 40-foot container.India usually exports a variety of goods including petroleum products, cereals, and chemicals using the Red Sea route. Exports in the current fiscal year are already flagging with a 6.5% contraction in the April to November period from a year ago, according to government data.The Red Sea disruption could hit margins for India’s oil and auto sectors, Madhavi Arora, a lead economist with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, wrote in a note published Dec. 22. But the bigger concern could be inflation, which has been above the central bank’s comfort zone of 4% since the end of 2019.“Higher global freight and insurance rates, possible upside risk to oil and global trade and re-emergence of potential supply chain would mean cost push inflation pressures,” she said."

He further added that the income disparity of people earning less than Rs 3.5 lakh per year has declined from 31.8 percent to 15.8 percent during 2013-14 to 2020-21, suggesting that share of this income group in total income in comparison to their population has increased by 16 percent.""Based on the current trends, we believe that by the end of the next decade around 50 percent of consumption (Rs 16 lakh crore) would be done by 90 percent of the people who are at the bottom the pyramid. Meanwhile, an additional Rs 8.2 lakh crore of consumption has moved to the lower end of the pyramid post pandemic following saving of expenditure through free food, shelter, and medical being provided by Government,"" Ghosh said.Also Read: RBI's post-Diwali retail loan dampener – will higher risk weights hurt spending?Ghosh's assertions are at odds with the consensus view that India's recovery after the economy's contraction in 2020-21 has been led by the upper class, with growth in demand for premium goods outstripping that for the mass-market segment. This pattern of recovery has been labelled 'K-shaped' by economists.However, the SBI economist cited the popularity of Zomato as the ""perfect example…to refute the claim that people are facing distress"".""As per Zomato, it is serving almost 1.4 crore active users in Metro, Urban and Semi-Urban areas… We estimate that around 0.44 crore active users are from semi-urban region only. With an average order size of say, around Rs 400 per user (as indicated in Zomato annual report) this indicates there is a clear indication of rising experience centric income groups transcending conventional boundaries,"" Ghosh said."

However, the nominal growth rate is seen at 8.9 percent – well below the government's assumption that it would be 10.5 percent.","A sharp fall in nominal GDP growth in 2023-24 could make it difficult for the Indian government to meet its fiscal deficit target of 5.9 percent of GDP.According to the statistics ministry's first advance estimate of GDP, released on January 5, India's nominal GDP growth – or GDP growth without adjusting for inflation – is set to plunge to 8.9 percent in 2023-24 – the lowest since the pandemic-hit year of 2020-21, and nearly half the 16.1 percent growth recorded in 2022-23. And while a fall was expected, it is also lower than the 10.5 percent the finance ministry had assumed in its budget numbers for the current year. A lower nominal GDP can cause issues for the government – both for 2023-24 and 2024-25.While nominal growth is seen falling in 2023-24, the real - or inflation-adjusted - growth rate is set to increase to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent.Fiscal slippage concerns?The budget for 2023-24 had assumed a nominal growth rate 10.5 percent over and above the first advance estimate of nominal GDP of Rs 273.08 lakh crore for 2022-23. This results in a nominal GDP of Rs 301.75 lakh crore, meaning that the projected fiscal deficit of Rs 17.87 lakh crore would fall to 5.9 percent of the GDP.But with the statistics ministry now estimating that this year's nominal GDP may be Rs 5 lakh crore lower, at Rs 296.58 lakh crore, the fiscal math is at a slight risk.Also Read: GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicatedAs a percentage of the first advance estimate of nominal GDP, a fiscal deficit of Rs 17.87 lakh crore is 6.0 percent, around 10 basis points (bps) higher than the target. If the government still wants to meet its target of 5.9 percent of GDP, it would have to cut its fiscal deficit by nearly Rs 40,000 crore.This is not the only risk to the fiscal deficit target for the year.Disinvestment receipts have been disappointingly low, with only a fifth of the Rs 51,000 crore target being raised so far. However, there are also positives in the form of huge dividends from the Reserve Bank of India as well as public sector enterprises. Throw better-than-budgeted tax collections into the mix, and the situation is perhaps not all that difficult. According to Nomura economists, these factors – as well as the Centre's focus on expenditure consolidation in what’s left of 2023-24 – should help it meet the fiscal target.Per latest available data, the Centre's fiscal deficit in April-November 2023 stood at Rs 9.07 lakh crore, or 50.7 percent of the full-year target.What of next year?As Moneycontrol has previously reported, the finance ministry may assume a nominal GDP growth rate of 11 percent for 2024-25 in the interim budget that Nirmala Sitharaman will present on February 1.According to the International Monetary Fund's recent Article IV staff report, the Indian government remains committed to reducing its fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26.""The adjustment will be implemented approximately evenly over 2024-25 and 2025-26,"" the IMF report said, suggesting that the interim budget may target a fiscal deficit of around 5.2 percent of GDP for next year.As global ratings agencies have repeatedly pointed out, higher growth is key to consolidation of the Indian government's finances. Lower-than-expected nominal growth this year does add a pinch of uncertainty then."

The US market saw the first negative week after nine consecutive weeks of positive closes. Indian markets moved in a narrow range, shedding 0.29 percent during the week.The start of the Q3 earnings season, coupled with uncertainty in the Middle East and the recent increase in Russian aggression, caused volatility to rise in the market. A sharp fall in Tech stocks after a downgrade due to poor sales expectations from Apple’s sales in China and restrictions on chip sales to China added to the volatility.As seen in some key indicators, the consolidation has also caused structural weakness.Are the markets topping up?Nifty is in the last stages of the topping process. If it falls below 21600, then we have a temporary top. What comes afterwards is a long overdue correction in markets. The depth may differ based on the interpretation of the June 2022-Jan 2024 rally. Preparing for a setback after a substantial market gain is best. The sentiment supports this thesis.In the near term, the market internals have started to weaken. As seen in the chart below, the number of stocks trading below the 20 DMA (Day Moving Average) is increasing even as the indices continue to make new highs. This is a negative divergence in price action relative to the behaviour of its components. But for a trend reversal, we must let the price action speak for itself.

The green line below measures the total futures market open interest for stocks and indices put together. But here, the number is divided by the Sensex value. The ratio gives us normalised data, which is more meaningful because if the futures open interest is going up due to the rising prices of the underlying stocks, then it's not new buying or addition.We see below that after the 29th of November, traders have stopped adding to their positions. The Futures OI ratio chart is not making new highs with the Nifty. It shows a lack of buying interest at higher levels among traders.

360,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-solving-the-hospital-insurance-tangle-12016521.html,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Solving the hospital-insurance tangle  ,"January 08, 2024 03:42 PM IST","In this edition of Moneycontrol Pro Panorama: Bangladeshi voters show dissent with low turnout, a decade of economic structural reforms leads nowhere, markets nonplussed with SEBI's new norms, receding twin deficit belies India’s strong growth, and more","Dear Reader,Dr Devi Shetty-promoted Narayana Hrudayalaya has got the insurance regulator IRDAI’s permission to test out an integrated healthcare cum insurance model, or managed healthcare. This will not be the first time that a healthcare provider has dabbled in health insurance. Apollo Hospitals too had promoted an insurance business under Apollo Munich that was eventually sold to HDFC and folded under its HDFC Ergo general insurance arm. Max India sold its stake in Max Bupa to True North and the health insurance is now called Niva Bupa.While the idea may seem an old one, the earlier ones were seen more as extensions of the group’s investments in the healthcare sector, such as diversifying into health insurance, diagnostics or pharmacy chains. These businesses would be incubated by the main holding company, but eventually have a business model independent of the parent. That is, the diagnostics and pharmacy would not necessarily be captive to the hospital chains owned by the parent. That made sense as the outside market opportunity was much larger and these businesses could become independent.Over the years, it’s been a mixed picture. Extensions such as pharmacy chains and diagnostic chains have had to compete with stiff competition from new entrants, especially after a funding deluge saw many standalone entities emerge. The health insurance space has been a tough one anyway. But primarily, the hospitals business itself calls for significant resources, both managerial and capital. That need has increased even more, as VC/PE funds are making a beeline for the sector, investing in hospitals – chains and standalone ones. Many have exited or pared down their stakes in these ventures. The sector is seeing consolidation and hospitals are also resorting to increasing their investments in a cluster rather than spreading out to different markets.Again, private capital’s interest in hospitals is not new, but the pace and level of investments is significant in this round. There may be a funding winter for startups, but mention hospitals and the purses open by magic. The legacy hospital chains must be wary of these developments as a well-funded competition with pressure from investors on the performance front could see more demand for the same pool of patients.Hospitalisation costs have also risen significantly in the past 3-4 years, resulting in higher claims’ payouts being made by insurers. That, in turn, puts pressure on the health insurance companies’ performance, which then results in disputes on claims, with hapless patients caught in between. He also points out that Narayana also has a history of giving relatively affordable healthcare options, especially in its home state of Karnataka.A managed healthcare model, as explained in an interview on the new model by Dr Shetty, published in TOI on January 8, is an innovative idea. It intends to invest Rs 150 crore in the venture and gradually onboard patients, with pre-screening and it will include coverage of pre-existing illnesses. What that means is that patients will probably need to undergo tests so that the company has a full picture of their health condition, and fix premiums accordingly, but not deny coverage in case of adverse health conditions.But care is likely to be provided on a continuous basis and not only in the case of hospitalisation, unlike the mediclaim model, which means it could cover OPD and even investigations that can amount to a tidy sum and are not covered by health insurance unless hospitalisation takes place within a pre-determined period after the investigations were done. OPD is offered in specific policies or as an add-on in mediclaim. The claims experience under the new system should be smoother as disputes will not arise, as the hospital and insurance provider are integrated and the patient’s medical history is already documented. Premiums could also be reasonable, as a result.These are aspects that should be attractive to patients. But there will be questions. What will the cost of such an insurance/managed healthcare package be since it’s a comprehensive coverage and not just hospitalisation insurance? Will patient acceptance be there, as it may tie them to one hospital network? What if they want to go to a different hospital for a specialised surgery? Will they need a separate health insurance policy in addition to this? What will be the co-pay amounts? Time will tell if the answers satisfy patients.India’s healthcare problems are complex and the solutions don’t need to be a one-size-fits-all variety only. If Narayana’s initial experience proves to be good and it can be scaled up, then other healthcare institutions can follow suit with their own models. And it is likely that the medical insurance provided by general insurance companies can co-exist with this. It is also being rolled out in one of India’s affluent cities, with a large white collar population, and one that’s open to innovative solutions to traditional problems. Will Narayana crack the hospital-insurer code is the big question that patients, industry and even investors will be awaiting answers for.Investing insights from our research teamDiscovery Series: Shivalik Bimetal Controls Limited — Powering growth in EVs, smart meters, and switchgear globallyTitan Company: Healthy Q3 FY24; shiny outlook continuesWill banks face margin pressure with deposit slackness continuing in Q3?FMCG: Quarterly preview shows no visible demand improvementWhat else are we reading?Indian economy to grow by a stunning 7.3 percent this year, but K-shaped growth persistsMC Pro Inside Edge: Can fallen angel Walchandnagar fly again?

361,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/lessons-from-the-maldivian-miscue-for-the-island-nation-and-india-12016471.html,Lessons from the Maldivian miscue for the island nation and India,"January 08, 2024 02:49 PM IST",Maldives is learning the hard way that geography matters more than the tilt of a government. The Modi and Muizzu governments must conduct relations based on this geographical proximity and not let the ministers’ blunders and the social media campaign against Maldives drive a wedge between the two countries,"The social media comments of three Maldivian deputy ministers in President Mohamed Muizzu’s government have ricocheted and they had to be “suspended”. It is a curious decision. Usually, they should have been dropped from the government.Suspended is a temporary rap on the knuckles of the belligerent ministers. It shows that personal statements made by political representatives against the head of a foreign government have serious political consequences.Maldives’ Diplomatic & Economic HowlerWhat seems to have set off the social media war of words was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Lakshadweep and his promotion of the Arabian Sea archipelago as a tourist destination. The Maldivian ministers perceived it as a one-upmanship on the part of India’s PM to score over Maldives.The new government of President Muizzi has taken a cold attitude towards India and showed its tilt towards China, with the Maldivian president asking India to withdraw its military personnel from the island-nation. It was indeed callow behaviour on the part of the three suspended ministers – Malsha Shareef, Mariyam Shiuna and Abdulla Mahzoom – to have written against Prime Minister Modi.It was passable for ordinary Maldivians to make mocking statements of foreign leaders, but it does not pass muster for those in government, even when the government looks upon India negatively.It is interesting however that the issue exploded and suspensions had to be announced when President Muizzu was leaving for China on his first official visit to that country. It can be argued that the response from the government came after  two former presidents of the Maldives, Mohammad Nashid and Ibrahim Solih, condemned the ministers’ statement on X, formerly Twitter, in strong language, and after the initial tepid response that the ministers’ statements were personal and they did not reflect the views of the government.There is also the fact that the highest tourist arrivals in 2023 in Maldives were from India, and the Maldives government soon recognised the folly of the derogatory remarks by the ministers. And it would appear that the ministers on their part were reacting to the possible fallout of Lakshadweep turning into a rival tourist destination.Lakshadweep, Maldives & TourismWhat seems to have set the alarm bells ringing in the Maldivian minds, including that of the ministers, was Prime Minister Modi’s snorkeling, which is a favourite island holiday to-do thing in Maldives too.  But Lakshadweep has been a holiday destination for a long time though the infrastructural facilities and marketing that mark Maldivian tourism is absent in the Indian archipelago, which is a Union Territory.But the Maldives’ India watchers missed the point that Prime Minister Modi, who is seen as representing the majoritarian Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was wooing the Muslim-majority Lakshadweep with the 2024 parliamentary elections just months away.The lesson from the Maldivian miscue goes beyond Maldives: It does not matter what is the tilt of a government; the relations between states, big and small, are governed by geography. The Maldives government has realised that they may not want Indian troops but they would need Indian tourists.And Indians too, amid all the social media calls for boycott, must recognise that Maldives should remain a tourist option even when Lakshadweep becomes one in its own right.Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr is a New Delhi-based journalist.

But the facade of a stable government can no longer mask the intensifying political strife and economic crisis  ,"As expected, Shiekh Hasina’s Awami League has returned to power in Dhaka, with a heavy majority, for a consecutive fourth term. Like her last two terms, the mandate lacks credibility. There was neither much contest nor popular participation in this election.Bangladesh is facing serious concerns on the economic front. The artificial stability on the political front may not help the cause.In a rerun of the 2014 election, the principal Opposition party, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), opted out of the 2024 election. Hundreds of their leaders and activists were rotting in jail. The third largest Jatiya Party entered a seat-sharing arrangement with the League. Even the 40 percent voter turnout was equivalent to 2014’s tally.The election was held in 299 of the 300 seats. Official results are not yet available in full. According to local media, the League should win around 225 seats. Jatiya Party might bag 11 with the blessings of the Awami League. The remaining 55-60 would go to the independent candidates.There are many ways to analyse the results. The low turnout would boost the morale of the Opposition. Bangladesh has been witnessing rising social tension and violence for some time. The trend may consolidate.Among the positives, unlike the heavily rigged 2018 election, the polling was arguably free and fair in 2024. The proof lies in the shock defeats of more than a dozen of senior Awami leaders in the hands of wannabe independents.In 2014, Awami League won more than half of the seats uncontested. This year at least three ministers, several central committee members and even the publicity secretary of the League lost the election.Also defeated are four top leaders of the Workers Party and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JaSoD-Inu). These Leftist parties were living at the mercy of Hasina and were allegedly legitimising the ruling dispensation.Everyone knows who these “independents” are. Under normal circumstances, they would have contested for the Opposition. And, that takes one to the question of what would have been the result had BNP joined the election.The question will keep dogging the nation in the days to come and may add to its economic uncertainty – marked by depleting foreign exchange reserves, high inflation and the falling price of Taka vis-à-vis the dollar in the kerb market. From $48 billion in 2021, Dhaka had $17 billion in forex reserves in December 2023. The central bank resisted further decline through open market purchases and fresh restrictions on spending.Pratim Ranjan Bose is an independent columnist, researcher, and consultant.

It might, however, reduce the West’s leverage over countries like Russia or Iran. And, with wars blazing in both Gaza and Ukraine, that’s no small thing","The BRICS grouping has long been distinguished by a consistent failure to live up to potential. The internal contradictions are crippling: Divergent interests between members make it difficult to develop any shared policies. Brazil, Russia and South Africa are commodity exporters; India and China are importers. Brazil, India and South Africa are democracies; Russia and China only pretend to be. And India and China, as everyone knows, don’t exactly see eye to eye on anything.This year, the bloc has decided to take the bold step of enhancing those internal divisions manifold by admitting five new members: Ethiopia, Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It was supposed to be six; but Argentina’s new president declared, in his usual restrained manner, that he had no intention of “allying with communists” and so won’t get a second Latin American member. BRICS made up for that by admitting four members from that tranquil zone of stability and co-operation, the Middle East, and a fifth, Ethiopia, that’s barely a year out of a devastating civil war.More importantly, while the Emiratis and the Saudis are partners, and Riyadh appears happy to give the regime in Cairo billions to stay friendly, Iran and Saudi Arabia have spent the past decade or so struggling for influence in the region. Iran backs the Houthi rebels in Yemen, for example, against whom Saudi Arabia has fought a long and ineffectual war. And there is anger in Ethiopia over the government’s silence on the years of abuse (and, allegedly, “mass killings”) that human rights groups say Saudi border guards have inflicted on Ethiopian migrants. Far from papering over existing cracks in the BRICS grouping, the the addition of new members has just increased the number of disputes.It may be hard to see how a group that has always struggled to get much done will be able to create anything substantive if they don’t even like each other. Still, with the addition of the new members, there are a couple of domains that bear watching. There’s a chance that, in these very specific fields, BRICS+ might prove to be unusually effective.One is infrastructure finance. The only real institution it has managed to build is the Shanghai-based New Development Bank. The “BRICS bank,” which is currently led by former Brazilian president Dilma Roussef, has a mandate to lend to infrastructure projects that the rest of the multilateral architecture ignores. One of the few things the existing BRICS members do agree on is that emerging economies need more project finance. Plus, they want that cash disbursed according to norms designed locally, not in the West.Of the two Beijing-backed financial institutions, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is better capitalised and has been a more effective lender than the NDB. That may be because the AIIB picked up several Western partners with deeper pockets than China’s BRICS peers, as well as partners with legacy, Western-led multilateral development banks. The NDB, meanwhile, has not always managed to offer competitive rates to possible borrowers.The very makeup of this alliance can work against its in-house bank. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it struggled to comply with the West’s various financial sanctions on one of its founding members. Shortly thereafter, Fitch downgraded it from AA+ to AA. (AIIB, in comparison, is rated AAA by the same agency.) The NDB’s management hopes that the addition of Saudi Arabia and the UAE prefigures an infusion of capital from the petrostates’ ample treasuries.The NDB can help with another thing that Iran, Russia, Brazil, the Saudis, and multiple other members of BRICS+ have in common: a dislike of the dollar. Forget all the “de-dollarisation” talk — as anyone buying oil from Russia or Iran can confirm, we’re still very distant from a world in which trading nations can avoid dealing in dollars. But one thing the NDB does well is creating long-term loans denominated in the developing world’s own currencies. Almost a quarter of its loans are in the local-currency format that these governments far prefer. They aren’t a threat to dollar dominance. But they are a first step towards creating separate, smaller pipelines of cash that aren’t subject to, say, US sanctions.For the current BRICS president, that’s a big priority. The Russian Federation took over leadership on Jan. 1, and we should expect Moscow’s priorities to dominate the expanded grouping’s initial agenda. Russia buys drones from Iran, collaborates with the Saudis on oil prices, and is building a nuclear reactor that will provide 10 percent of Egypt’s power. BRICS’s doubling in size won’t make it a more coherent threat to the West. It might, however, reduce the West’s leverage over countries like Russia or Iran. And, with wars blazing in both Gaza and Ukraine, that’s no small thing.Mihir Sharma  is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this public.Credit: Bloomberg "

This solidifies India as a promising investment choice among emerging markets.India's MSCI Emerging Markets index spiked in eight years, leaping from 7 percent to 17.1 percent. With the ongoing domestic institutional investments and potential steady FII participation, India could surpass a 20 percent weight in the MSCI EM Index by early 2024, according to recent Nuvama report.Recent Jefferies notes suggest that India is poised to attract more foreign investments in 2024 in the medium term. India's positioning in EM portfolios remains relatively light, but its growing size is making its markets more relevant for global funds. Favourable conditions such as expected political stability, a rising investment cycle, and a peaking US dollar create an ideal scenario for higher foreign flows.After a significant outflow of $33 billion from 2H21-1H22, FPI flows have reversed, with the highest inflows observed in the last 11 years. India's rising weight in EMs has contributed to these increased flows, with its neutral weight in the benchmark MSCI EM rising by 3.5 percentage point over the past six quarters. However, analysis shows that India's relative position in large EM active funds are closer to neutral now, rather than significantly above the average. Therefore, the potential for FPIs to take a larger position could become a crucial driver for future flows, Jefferies note added.India's MSCI EM pack share was steady at 8 percent until October 2020, nearly doubling since then. This surge was fuelled by factors like India's introduction of a standardised Foreign Ownership Limit (FOL) in 2020, robust performance in Indian equities (especially in the Midcap segment), and weaker performance in other emerging market packs, notably China.By 2023, India's stock count in the MSCI Standard index increased to 131, with a net addition of 17 Indian stocks across four reviews, showing an improvement from 2022 inclusion of only nine Indian stocks. Factors contributing to this rise in 2023 include India's substantial market rally compared to other emerging markets and MSCI's transition from semi-annual to quarterly rebalancing.China's weight in the MSCI EM index has decreased to 26.6 percent from 33.5 percent a year ago, while Taiwan, South Korea and Brazil have seen marginal increase since last year.Client Associates (CA), India’s largest multi-family office, advocates for increased India representation in MSCI Emerging Market Index (MSCI EM) and MSCI All Countries World Index (MSCI ACWI). The white paper emphasises India's robust economic growth, set to become the world's third-largest economy by the decade's end. It urges a reassessment of India's allocation in global indices, noting the disparity between its potential and current MSCI representation.Exploring India's market capitalisation/GDP contrasted with MSCI EM and MSCI ACWI allocation, the paper highlights India's potential for diversification and better risk-adjusted returns. It identifies high promoter ownership limiting foreign investment in large firms and India's insufficient market accessibility as key reasons for under-representation in MSCI indices.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions."

373,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/moneycontrol-pro-weekender-the-gremlin-boogie-hangover-12006131.html,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender: The Gremlin Boogie hangover,"January 06, 2024 03:47 PM IST",The year 2024 began on a party mode as Powell-led US Fed hinted at a dovish stance.,"Dear Reader, For the markets, 2024 started with a hangover, which is hardly a surprise, given the wild partying that had begun even before Powell gave the green light for the festivities. Powell’s dovish cooing led to a celebration, the likes of which hadn’t been seen in a long time—the Bank of America survey of fund managers for December 2023 said investors were the highest stock overweight since February 2022, the highest bond overweight in 15 years, the lowest cash overweight since April 2021 and the highest commodity underweight since June 2017. In that context, the morning after’s hangover has been rather mild.The real questions are: is the Goldilocks 2024 scenario of a soft landing with low inflation still intact? And how much of that has been baked into stock prices? It is the uncertainty around these questions that the markets are grappling with. As Moneycontrol Pro’s independent research team put it, ‘investors today are a happy but a nervous lot, not savouring the fruits of their investment for fears of an imminent correction’. After analysing the markets in depth, they concluded that ‘while bears might fight to make a comeback, by the end of the year, the bulls are likely to have the last laugh.’Second thoughts about the rally were triggered by the minutes of the last Fed meeting, which, as this FT story (free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers) points out, added to doubts that the US central bank is poised to begin cutting interest rates as early as March, dashing market expectations. Our columnist Ananya Roy points to inflated valuations and advises caution for investors even as they ride the rally. What that translates into, at a practical level, is that 2024 could be the year of alpha stock pickers rather than macro chasers, as S Krishnakumar, the founder of Lion Capital, told us in this interview. You’ll find some of these alpha stock picks from my research colleagues below.Some incoming data in the new year have been upsetting. Germany’s retail inflation, for instance, moved up to an annualised 3.7 percent in December, up from 3.2 percent in the previous month. Retail inflation in France too was higher. Inflation according to the Eurozone consumer price index too came in higher for December, albeit a bit lower than forecast.Geopolitics has sent an early signal that it continues to be a problem, with attacks on ships in the Red Sea leading to a surge in shipping costs.As for growth, the US Composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), a snapshot of private sector activity in both manufacturing and services, picked up a bit in December. Despite the improvement, Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Intelligence, said, ""The more challenging demand environment has dampened firms’ pricing power, squeezing service sector selling price inflation to the lowest for over three years on average during the fourth quarter. With sticky service sector inflation being a key area of concern among Fed policymakers, the slower rate of price increase in December is welcome news."" The PMI numbers so far bear out the US soft landing hopes. The Composite PMI also edged up in December for Japan and the UK, while the reading continued to be in contractionary territory (below 50) in the Eurozone.India is in a different league altogether. In India, the Composite PMI accelerated to 58.5 in December 2023 from an already high 57.4 in November. The strength of India’s PMI is seen when compared to the US Composite PMI of 50.9, of the UK at 52.1, the Eurozone at 47.6, of Brazil and Japan at 50 and China at 52.6.It is this strength in the economy and the acceleration in momentum that has led India’s National Statistical Office to forecast real GDP growth of 7.3 percent in 2023-24 in its first advance estimate, which is higher than the RBI’s estimate of 7 percent.The only concern is that the strong demand could lead to price pressures. The PMI survey said, ‘The rate of increase in prices charged for the provision of services in India was solid, above its long-run average and faster than that seen for input costs. The upturn was reportedly induced by rising instances of firms passing on cost burdens to their customers.’ Furthermore, since nominal GDP growth is estimated to be 8.9 percent in 2023-24, while the assumption in the Union Budget was for 10.5 percent growth, that would mean the government may have to curb spending in the next few months to keep the fiscal deficit at the targeted 5.9 percent of GDP. However, the first advance estimate is only a rough extrapolation and it’s certain to get revised and re-revised over time.The immediate trigger for the markets, though, is the US non-farm payrolls for December, which came in far better than expected. The unemployment rate came in lower than expected, while average hourly earnings rose more than consensus. That led to a drop in the probability of a Fed rate cut at its March meeting, although the market is still pricing it around 50 percent. On the other hand, non-farm payrolls were revised lower for previous months, so it’s best to take the numbers with a pinch of salt.For the markets, while the strong jobs report points to decent growth, it raises the prospect of inflation remaining high and dampens expectations of a rate cut. The question the Fed has avoided so far is whether the loosening of financial conditions, as seen in the sharp drop in bond yields, has contributed to growth and the continued strength of the labour market.Perhaps, as this FT story says, ‘’If financial markets are correct in suggesting the desirability of an early rate reduction, they have gone too far in suggesting interest rates will decline almost as quickly as they rose, pricing in 1.5 percentage points of reductions in both the US and eurozone this year.’’How long will the hangover last? That will depend on the kind of hangover. In his hilarious novel ''The Mating Season', PG Wodehouse wrote, ‘I am told by those who know that there are six varieties of hangover—the Broken Compass, the Sewing Machine, the Comet, the Atomic, the Cement Mixer and the Gremlin Boogie, and his manner suggested that he had got them all.’The one the markets are suffering from is probably the Gremlin Boogie, which, according to this blog, ‘’ is almost always experienced in groups and its symptoms include an unfounded sense of wellbeing, hysterical laughter, the desire to buy goods which at other times would be deemed unnecessary and a masochistic enjoyment of the other types of hangover. Most commonly, it fuels within the sufferer a rampant desire to continue drinking, the victim becoming so caught up in the joy of the communal hangover that he or she cannot bear for the experience to end. Indeed, it is generally wise to allow the Gremlin Boogie to run its course.’’Cheers, Manas ChakravartyHere are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets:Stocks Cera Sanitaryware, Why this NBFC is an ideal bull market stock, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank, NCC Ltd, DCB Bank,  L&T Technology Services, Syngene, Bosch, What can investors expect from FMCG companies in the December ’23 quarter?; Ujjivan SFB, Weekly tactical pick, Avalon Tech and Elin Electronics, Prudent Corporate Advisory ServicesMarkets MC Markets Poll for 2024SME IPOs: Here are 7 tips to tell the good from the badThe froth in small and midcap stocksWhat drives the PSU stocks rally?Which price do professional traders watch the most?Sharp volatility, correction likely ahead of Q3 resultsFinancial Times The Magnificent Seven is not the only concentration America should worry aboutYear in a word: Higher for longerLEX: Iron ore/China--rusty metal shines in marketsRuchir Sharma: Top ten trends for 2024Inside Edge Indiabulls' believers, Man Friday eyes Themis Biosyn, Market veteran's scion eyes Dishman, collecting is the new diversificationWockhardt’s new bull, options ‘genius’ of Bhatkudgaon, wealth god’s Zee buying bingeCement stock catches fancy, Mankind's giant leap, SEAMEC's stranded get a lifeboat, trading landbank for a landlineCompanies and industry Steel industry faces a new risk on the horizonWill traction in 2W sales alleviate concerns of K-shaped recovery?Trouble at the margin for FMCG companies and distributors?Iron ore’s uptrend signals expectations of buoyant steel output Rising demand for windmills improve project pipeline for Suzlon, Inox WindDiagnostic companiesEconomy and policy Can Panagariya rekindle the spirit of co-operative federalism?Wide state bond yield spread benefits investors but won’t hurt states muchPro Economic TrackerHealthcare regulation—what should be the watchdog’s mandate?Manufacturing PMI shows moderating growth, lower input costsTime to give Aatmanirbhar India a Chinese makeover?Designed to help, Aadhaar is a nightmare for the poorThe Green Pivot Booming EV sales are good for car companies but not so much for the climateCarbon reduction alone isn’t enough, India needs to step up on carbon removal tooIndia’s solar energy capacity is growing but challenges remainTech and startups Is your AI program racist?Startup Street: Social justice and the startup ecosystemMore principles, less hollow valuations from startupsGeopolitics OPEC is losing its mojoThe Pakistan military will call the shots in forthcoming elections and dictate foreign policy Budget 2024 Budget Snapshot | India's government punches above its weight in garnering revenueBudget Snapshot | How does India’s fiscal deficit compare with its peers?Budget Snapshot: How does India compare with East and Southeast Asian nations on government spending?IMF recommends a new Fiscal Strategy statement for Union BudgetPre-Budget wishlist: Give greater flexibility to the self-employed to switch between old and new tax regimes Budget should push round-the-clock electricity generation capacityPersonal Finance Tata Mutual Fund launches gold schemes—is it too late?Cyber frauds: How to avoid losing money to fraudsters Inequality will widen until giving becomes a part of personal financesStay with your investment strategy amid market euphoria"

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 170,000 jobs. The economy added 2.7 million jobs in 2023, a sharp step-down from the 4.8 million positions created in 2022.""This report lowers the probability of the Fed cutting in March and confirms our view that the Fed will not begin cutting as soon as the markets expect,"" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina.The latest Fed meeting on January 4 gave a growing sense that inflation is under control and raised concern about the risks that an ""overly restrictive"" monetary policy may hold for the economy.Bank of America in a research note on January 5 said it was taking a defensive stance toward oil stocks because of the long-term price forecast for oil.Bank of America expects ""the $70-$90 (a barrel) Brent trading range in place since OPEC+ intervened to hold. But the risk is a permanently backward oil curve steepened by spare capacity that is a headwind for sector value.""Benchmark prices dipped from earlier highs after Bank of America released its note.""Our 2024 base case is $80 Brent,"" Bank of America added. ""But recognizing perpetual backwardation as a new normal our 2-yearforward (long-term) price deck drops to $75 Brent / $70 WTI from 2026.""Maersk announced it will divert all vessels away from the Red Sea for the foreseeable future, warning customers of disruptions.As the threat of the conflict expanding persists, Blinken was set to travel to the Middle East for a week of diplomacy, the State Department said."

The euro rose 0.29% to $1.0975.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%, the S&P 500 gained 0.65% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.75%. In Europe, the pan-regional STOXX 600 index lost 0.14%. The blistering rally for equity markets at the end of 2023 was based on expectations that the Fed, alongside significant easing by the European Central Bank, would cut interest rates six times this year.The monthly nonfarm payrolls report showed the US economy added 216,000 new jobs in December. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a gain of 170,000.The jobless rate held steady at 3.7%, down from most forecasters' expectations for it to rise, prompting concerns for some investors that the Fed's long battle against inflation may have further to run.Future labor demand is very soft and every other piece of the unemployment report is pointing in a downward direction, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief US economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in New York.The number of private wage and salary workers has declined, overall aggregate hours, a proxy for GDP, haven't grown for three months in a row and temporary employment has been down for 11 straight months, he said.""You take the headline numbers, which are a little bit better than expected, and people are drawing the incorrect conclusion of the report is strong,"" LaVorgna said.Euro zone inflation data on January 5 showed prices in the currency bloc rose 2.9% on a year-on-year basis in December, up from 2.4% in November and potentially creating less urgency for the ECB to start cutting borrowing costs from record highs.Traders on January 5 saw about a 74% chance of the Fed starting to lower its benchmark overnight interest rate from the current 5.25%-5.50% range in March, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, slightly higher than a week ago.Elswhere in financial markets, Japan's Nikkei added 0.3% as exporters got a boost from a weaker yen. A deadly New Year's Day earthquake in Japan has also forced wagers for the ultra-dovish Bank of Japan to tighten monetary policy this month off the table.Spot gold added 0.5% to $2,054.39 an ounce.Oil markets remained volatile as expectations of weak demand from China clashed with concerns about additional Red Sea supply disruptions following attacks on ships by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis.US crude recently rose 2.01% to $73.64 per barrel and Brent was at $78.70, up 1.43% on the day."

The finance ministry, too, has said it expects GDP growth to ""comfortably"" exceed its forecast of 6.5 percent, although it did not provided an updated numerical forecast following the stunning 7.6 percent growth seen in July-September 2023.The government's first advance estimate for the current financial year's GDP comes ahead of the February 1 presentation of the interim Budget for 2024-25. The finance ministry will use the first advance estimate of the GDP while making its Budget numbers. More specifically, the finance ministry will assume a certain nominal GDP growth rate for 2024-25 - Moneycontrol has previously reported that this may be 11.0 percent - while deciding its various Budget numbers for next year, including the fiscal deficit target and growth in tax collections.Also Read: GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicatedFor 2023-24, the finance ministry had assumed a nominal GDP growth of 10.5 percent. However, as per the statistics ministry's first advance estimate, India's GDP in nominal terms may grow by only 8.9 percent this year.SECTORAL BREAKDOWN OF INDIA'S GDP DATAFY24FY23Real GDP growth 7.3%7.2%Real GVA growth 6.9%7.0%    Agriculture,forestry, fishing1.8%4.0%    Mining, quarrying8.1%4.6%    Manufacturing6.5%1.3%    Electricity, gas, water supply, other utility services8.3%9.0%    Construction10.7%10.0%    Trade, hotels, transport, communication, broadcast services6.3%14.0%    Financial, real estate, and professional services8.9%7.1%    Public administration, defence, other services7.7%7.2%A five-fold improvement in the manufacturing sector's growth to 6.5 percent from 1.3 percent in 2022-23 is set to drive growth higher this year, with the construction sector posting an even more impressive growth rate of 10.7 percent on top of a 10.0 percent expansion in 2022-23. Other sectors expected to post higher rates of gross value added (GVA) growth this year include mining and quarrying, financial, real estate, and professional services, and public administration, defence, and other services.On the flip side, agricultural growth is seen slowing down sharply to an eight-year low of 1.8 percent this year, as erratic monsoons take their toll on farm output.The overall GVA growth for 2023-24 is seen at 6.9 percent, slightly lower than 7.0 percent last year. GDP is the sum of GVA and indirect taxes, less subsidies.On the expenditure side of things, the picture was more mixed, with private consumption growth seen slowing down sharply to 4.4 percent in 2023-24 from 7.5 percent last year. At the same time, gross fixed capital formation - a proxy for investments - is expected to grow robustly again at a rate of 10.3 percent as against 11.4 percent in 2022-23.While the headline GDP number will further boost confidence in the Indian economy, it is likely to undergo several revisions. On February 29, the statistics ministry will release GDP data for October-December 2023 and the second advance estimate for the full year. This will be followed by the provisional estimate at the time of release of data for January-March 2024 at the end of May. Subsequently, three revised estimates will be released.Most economists expected the full-year GDP growth to come in lower than the RBI's official forecast of 7.0 percent. However, the central bank will not be surprised with its prediction being exceeded. In the post monetary policy press conference on December 8, Deputy Governor Michael Patra had said that high-frequency data for October and November - used by RBI economists for their 'nowcast', or an updated or quick forecast - were ""very robust"".""So, if you just take October-November data, you will exceed 7 percent (growth in 2023-24). So, at the current time, 7 percent is a conservative estimate,"" Patra had said."

Certain changes have been made in the RBI's Know Your Customer (KYC) norms.The earlier norms pertaining to PEPs were open-ended and there was a lack of clarity on the definition, apparently leading to issues for bankers, parliamentarians and others. There were also concerns in certain quarters that PEPs were finding it difficult to get loans or open bank accounts. In the amended KYC master direction, the central bank defines PEPs as ""individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, including the heads of states/governments, senior politicians, senior government or judicial or military officers, senior executives of state-owned corporations and important political party officials"".The new rules also include a person who is entrusted by a foreign country with a public function. Bank accounts of PEPs have additional KYC norms under the current provisions and special due diligence has to be undertaken by a senior bank official.A sub-clause in the master direction in KYC norms issued by way of a circular on February 25, 2016 has been removed by the central bank. The central bank has also asked chairpersons and chief executives of banks and other financial services, which are into lending business, to make the changes effective immediately.Last year, the Centre amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) to introduce more disclosures for non-government organisations by reporting entities."

It could mean a longer wait for interest rate cuts,"January 05, 2024 04:17 PM IST",The figure released January 5 was up from the 2.4% annual inflation recorded in November but is well down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022.,"Inflation plaguing Europe rose to 2.9% in December, rebounding after seven straight monthly declines. The rise in price levels cast doubt on predictions for speedy interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.The figure released January 5 was up from the 2.4% annual inflation recorded in November but is well down from the peak of 10.6% in October 2022.ECB President Christine Lagarde warned that inflation could tick up in coming months, taking a detour from its recent downward path. The central bank for the 20 European Union countries that use the euro currency has raised its benchmark interest rate to a record-high 4% and says it will keep it there as long as necessary to push inflation down to its goal of 2% considered best for the economy.The faster-than-expected fall in inflation over the last months of 2023 had led some analysts to predict the central bank would start cutting interest rates as early as March.The December rebound in inflation supported analysts who are predicting that rates wouldn't start to come down until June.Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist at ING bank, said a jump in inflation to 3.8% from 2.3% in Germany, Europe's largest economy, ""strengthens the stance of keeping a very steady hand and not rushing into any rate cut decisions.""Officials at the US Federal Reserve also stressed the importance of keep rates high until inflation is ""clearly moving down,"" according to minutes of their Dec. 12-13 meeting released January 3. The Fed has signaled three rate cuts this year.US consumer prices were up 3.1% in November from a year earlier.Higher interest rates are the typical central bank tool against inflation. They raise the cost of borrowing for consumer purchases, particularly of houses and apartments, and for business investment in new offices and factories.That lowers demand for goods and relieves pressure on prices but it also can limit growth at a time when it's in short supply in Europe. The economy shrank 0.1% in the July-to-September quarter.Inflation itself, however, has been a key challenge to economic growth because it robs consumers of purchasing power. The ECB, like other central banks around the world, said raising rates quickly was the best way to get it under control and avoid even more drastic measures later.The December inflation figure was boosted by the end of energy subsidies in Germany and France that had lowered prices a year ago.Core inflation, which excludes volatile fuel and food prices, eased to 3.4% from 3.6% in November, according to European Union statistics agency Eurostat. The figure is closely watched by the ECB.Inflation spiked in Europe as the rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic strained supplies of parts and raw materials, then as Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, raising costs for food and energy.Europe has since found other supplies of natural gas outside Russia to generate electricity, power factories and heat homes, so energy prices have eased.Europe, and the rest of the world, is facing a possibility of new delays and higher prices for consumer products as attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels have scared away the world's largest container shipping companies and energy giant BP from sailing through the Red Sea and Suez Canal."

The upcoming national elections will add more fodder to consumption and general euphoria.Is it any surprise that Indians can no longer resist putting their savings into a market that is being chased by big global pockets for two years now? Today’s investors of India are not the guaranteed return-seeking boomers or even anxiety ridden paycheck-counting middle agers but young millennials and Gen Z who have yet to see a debilitating economic downcycle or a crisis (the pandemic doesn’t count anymore).December’s record high demat account additions is a fallout of this demographic. My colleague Ravindra Sonavane brings all the details here. Will it sustain? The jury is still out but Indians are not backing away from dipping their toes into the stock market. Household savings have been lured by “mutual fund sahi hai” for more than a decade now and systematic investment plans (SIP) form an integral part of retail participation in equities today. Starry eyed by the bull run in equities and egged on by finfluencers on social media platforms, young Indians, even those living paycheck to paycheck, decided the stock market is where the real money is. And why not? The market is ridden with anecdotes of rags to riches (even riches to rags but no one notices these).But within the equity market’s lap lies a different beast: the derivatives. In October, we were warned that derivatives account for 99.6 percent of the total equity market volume and index options contribute 99 percent of the derivatives volume by an Axis Mutual Fund report authored by Ashish Gupta. A stock option is a bet, not a hedge, that gives the trader an exposure that is a million times the size of the bet or contract.Stock options offer unbeatable odds to make money but what they also hide is unparalleled risk. While retail participation in stock options at the aggregate level is not enough to upset the market, it is enough to ruin the trader and hence put off potential investors who could create wealth through sane long term equity investment.Warnings shots were fired by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the watchdog of capital markets early last year but most of these have been just coddling of investors and telling them to please be careful. So far, SEBI has steered clear of any efforts to crimp this surge in equity trading and just ensured some guardrails are in place. As such, analysts believe that trading margins in India are more restrictive and higher compared with other markets.In effect, the options frenzy is yet to reach a level where it may derail the gravy train of the cash market or worse grind the equities wheels to a halt. But what it has done is build unparalleled leverage. Leverage is lovely if it works towards creation of wealth but the other side of it is risk. Nine out of ten options traders made a loss, according to the regulator.Indices have had a sobering start to 2024 but the undercurrent of expectations is huge. The US Federal Reserve is anticipated to begin rate cuts later this year, and national elections would give enough fodder for volatility in the markets.

The finance ministry suggested that the PSU should be closed as there is no investor interest,” the official told Moneycontrol.Once the commerce ministry recommends MMTC’s closure, the final decision will be taken by Alternative Mechanism (AM), which is a panel of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari and commerce minister Piyush Goyal.The government has approved the closure of about 21 lossmaking PSUs, but very few have been completed.“Closure of PSUs is more difficult than disinvestment as it leads to huge job losses,” the official said.Once the Alternative Mechanism approves the closure of MMTC, it will be coordinated by the finance ministry’s Department of Public Enterprises, which looks at the process of PSU closures.The government holds a 89.93 percent stake in MMTC, which is short of the minimum 25 percent public shareholding norm. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the sale of a 9.33 percent stake in MMTC in 2012 via an offer for sale, which hasn’t taken place.The CCEA had in 2020 given in-principle approval for strategic disinvestment in MMTC by sale of a 49.78 percent stake.However, minister of state for commerce and industry Anupriya Patel informed the Lok Sabha on August 9, 2023, that the government has not taken a decision on the strategic disinvestment of MMTC.MMTC’s quarterly net profit declined 99 percent to Rs 10.67 crore in September 2023 from Rs 1,117.19 crore a year earlier. Net sales fell 87 percent to Rs 1.81 crore.The company’s shares have gained about 72 percent in the past one year.In August 2023, the Securities and Exchange Board of India cancelled the registration of MMTC as a stockbroker for its involvement in an illegal ‘paired contract’ in a case pertaining to the defunct National Spot Exchange."

However, the rate of increase in these overseas orders was the lowest in six months.""Services firms in India expect the strong demand momentum to carry forward to 2024 which, coupled with advertising and better customer relationships, underpinned upbeat forecasts for output. The overall degree of business optimism was strong and better than that seen in November,"" S&P Global, which compiles the index, said.As new orders increased, there was continued ""mild pressure"" on service firms' capacities in December. Employment in the sector rose slightly, at a faster rate than in November.On the prices front, input cost inflation for service providers fell to the lowest in 40 months in December. However, in a sign of improving corporate margins, prices charged to customers rose at a faster pace than the increase in input prices.""The rate of increase in prices charged for the provision of services in India was solid, above its long-run average and faster than that seen for input costs. The upturn was reportedly induced by rising instances of firms passing on cost burdens to their customers,"" S&P Global noted.Economists widely expect headline retail inflation to have risen further in December from 5.55 percent in November and test the upper-bound of the Reserve Bank of India's 2-6 percent tolerance range.""We are forecasting India's December CPI inflation at 6.03 percent,"" said Kaushik Das, Deutsche Bank's chief economist for India and South Asia.""The reason for the uptick is primarily an unfavourable base… If the December CPI print comes at 6.0 percent, as per our forecast, this will lead to an average of 5.5 percent in October-December 2023, 10 basis points lower than RBI's forecast of 5.6 percent. With the base effect becoming more favourable from January and as vegetable prices continue to fall during the winter months aided by the arrival of new crops, CPI inflation will likely moderate to 5.0 percent average in January-March 2024,"" Das added.Inflation data for December 2023 will be released on January 12."

Their fair value range is 18-21x, suggesting a 0-7 percent return this year.Nomura's base case anticipates ongoing disinflation, lower yields, a modest global growth slowdown, and favorable 2024 general elections. They predict India's valuation to stay high, backed by macro stability, clearer earnings visibility, and increased capital flows.However, sustained high commodity or oil prices and adverse election outcomes pose significant risks for India. Globally, scenarios of no landing (strong growth, persistent inflation, higher yields) and a hard landing (steep declines in growth, inflation, yields) could raise risk premiums and lower valuations.

Its top picks in small and mid cap are Coforge, Lupin, Medplus Health Services, Dalmia Bharat, Federal Bank, Sansera Engineering.Nomura anticipates a 20 percent CAGR in corporate earnings (Nifty 100) from FY19-24, a significant increase from the mid-to-high single-digit growth in FY15-20. Corporate earnings to GDP, which declined post the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), rebounded to 8.8 percent in FY23 from a low of 4.6 percent in FY18.

This distraction provides the Pakistani establishment with the bandwidth to craft and control the national narrative by camouflaging internal strife and evading accountability,"Pakistan is a nation of distractions. Its landscape of distractions has been meticulously constructed by its military-dominated establishment, steering focus away from pressing domestic issues of everyday concerns. This carefully crafted playbook is aimed at ensuring that Pakistanis are distracted towards archaic issues of trivial significance in their daily lives and aspirations, thereby shielding the powers-that-be from public scrutiny on critical issues. Pakistan is facing a severe economic downturn, political repression, and growing public anger against its high-handed policy in the country’s hinterland such as Balochistan and tribal districts. To fade these issues into the background, the Pak establishment orchestrates familiar diversionary tactics, exemplified by the designation of January 5 as Kashmir’s Right to Self-Determination Day in recent years.However, this serves more as a smokescreen than genuine concern for the region where it has engaged in proxy war since decades wherein thousands have perished in its efforts to destabilise India. This distraction provides the Pakistani establishment with the necessary bandwidth to craft and control the national narrative by camouflaging internal strife and evading accountability. As such, January 5 joins a roster of distraction dates, including February 5 (Kashmir Solidarity Day) and October 27 (Kashmir Black Day), which have lost significance due to evolving realities in Jammu and Kashmir.Political Scene in J&KThe altered political landscape of Jammu and Kashmir, reshaped within the Indian union, constitutionally approved and judicially stamped re-arrangement, has rendered these designated days increasingly symbolic. Consequently, its miniscule political constituency stands obliterated in the region and exposed to the local people for their nefarious role in keeping the region embroiled in ever continuing cycle of violence.Moreover, United Nations’ resolutions, like the UNCIP’s resolutions of 1948 and subsequent agreements, remain unfulfilled due to Pakistan’s dismissal of conditions laid therein. It may be recalled that the UN Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) adopted a supplementary resolution on January 5, 1949, to its earlier resolution of August 13, 1948, laying down principles for the plebiscite in J&K, subject to the fulfilment subject to certain conditions by India and Pakistan. Interestingly, the foremost condition laid down by UNCIP Resolution (Part II (A)(1)(2)) of August 13, 1948, included the withdrawal of the “tribesmen and Pakistan nationals not normally resident therein who have entered the State for the purpose of fighting” from J&K, including Gilgit-Baltistan, as their presence constituted “a material change in the situation”. It is a historical fact that the Pakistani establishment rejected these conditions forthwith and never took any practical steps towards fulfilling any of the parameters laid down in the resolution.Agreements And Resolutions Further, it subsequently agreed to resolve any pending issues with India via a bilateral mechanism through Shimla Agreement of 1972. In its Section 1(ii), the two countries resolved “to settle their differences by peaceful means by bilateral negotiations or by any other peaceful means mutually agreed upon between them. Pending the final settlement of any of the problems between the two countries, neither side shall unilaterally alter the situation and both shall prevent the organisation, assistance or encouragement of any acts detrimental to the maintenance of peace and harmonious relations.”Despite initial agreements, such as the Shimla Agreement of 1972, calling for peaceful bilateral resolutions, Pakistan’s persistent public agitation over UNCIP Resolutions concerning Kashmir lacks logical grounding. It contrasts sharply with its lack of practical adherence to their stipulations and demonstrates a disconnect between its rhetoric and actions. While Pakistan champions these resolutions on the international stage, its domestic instability becomes a catalyst for diverting attention from the nation’s actual challenges. Therefore, its emphasis on outdated UN Resolutions on Kashmiri is nothing but a tool for the military-dominated establishment to sidestep accountability, directing public attention away from internal instability and grievances.Crisis in PoJK Moreover, Pakistan’s administration of the portion of Jammu and Kashmir which it has occupied since 1947 reveals its true intentions toward the region's people. Pakistan has created of façade of self-governance in POJK since its occupation of the region, which is at best nominal in character, with all the affairs of the region managed by the military. Pakistan Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (POJK), along with Gilgit-Baltistan, operates under the practical control of a three-star General from the Pakistan Army’s Rawalpindi-based X Corps. As Human Rights Watch notes in one of its reports, “The Pakistani government represses democratic freedoms, muzzles the press and practices routine torture.” It further noted locals desiring of public offices prerequisite providing a written pledge of loyalty to Islamabad. “There is a façade of an elected local government, but the federal government in Islamabad, the army and the intelligence agencies control all aspects of political life in Azad Kashmir…The military shows no tolerance for dissent and practically runs the region as a fiefdom,” the report states.As such, Pakistan’s handling of the PoJK from a purely military perspective, including Gilgit-Baltistan, have left these regions at the margins of the development with high inflation, scant socio-economic infrastructure and higher levels of unemployment. These regions not only lag behind Jammu and Kashmir in terms of development but also rank lowest in every developmental indicator within Pakistan. For example, POJK experiences a poverty rate of 29%, while Gilgit-Baltistan's poverty rate soared to 35%, surpassing Pakistan's national average of 28%. In contrast, Jammu and Kashmir has a poverty rate of around 10% according to government data.Glaring Disparities between PoJK and J&KThe economic disparities have become starkly evident over the years. In terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), POJK recorded a GDP of $6.5 billion in the 2020-21 fiscal year compared to Jammu and Kashmir’s $22 billion in the same period. Likewise, there are glaring infrastructure gaps between these regions, particularly in road networks, railways, and airport facilities. POK’s meagre 276 KM length of national highways contrasts starkly with Jammu and Kashmir’s expansive 2423 KM network. While Jammu and Kashmir anticipates linking a 357 KM railway line to India’s national railway network in the near future, POK remains devoid of any such connectivity. Similarly, the region lacks adequate airport infrastructure, with only small airfields in Gilgit and Skardu, whereas Jammu and Kashmir boasts an international airport in Srinagar with pan-India connectivity.The health infrastructure further highlights the disparities, with POJK having 589 health facilities, including 23 major hospitals, 11 tehsil level hospitals, 50 Rural Health Centres and 225 Basic Health Centres. In comparison, Jammu and Kashmir has an extensive network of 3834 health facilities, including 22 district hospitals, 84 Community Health Centres, 398 Primary Health Centres, and multiple medical colleges.These stark gaps in socio-economic indicators between PoJK and J&K underscore Pakistan’s systematic neglect of these regions, depriving them of essential developmental opportunities and basic infrastructure, even as the military dominated establishment in Islamabad continues to smokescreen Kashmir for its domestic agenda. Therefore, as Pakistan ricochets its rabble rousing of UN resolutions on Kashmir in days ahead, it needs to be seen in the context of its repressive domestic political environment, internal dissidence and an unending economic crisis.Arun Anand is an author and columnist who has written several books.

The report notes that economic growth in India is projected to remain ""strong"" at 6.2 per cent this year mainly supported by resilient private consumption and strong public investment.While manufacturing and services sectors will continue to support the economy, erratic rainfall patterns will likely dampen agricultural output, it said.""Indian economy again outperformed its peers, not just this year but the last few years,"" Chief of the Global Eonomic Division Monitoring Branch, Economic Analysis and Policy Division (UN DESA) Hamid Rashid told reporters.He said that India's economic growth has consistently remained over six per cent and ""we believe this will continue in 2024 and 2025 as well."" Rashid noted that although inflation was relatively high for India, it didn't have to raise rates as much and inflation has come down quite a bit.""That has allowed the government to sustain the fiscal support that it needed,"" he said adding that ""we didn't see significant fiscal adjustments or fiscal retrenchment in India.""Overall, domestic consumption is growing, household spending has grown, employment situation has improved quite a bit. So we are very optimistic about India's growth outlook in the near term,"" he said.In response to a question on factors holding back India's economic growth, Director of the Economic Analysis and Policy Division Shantanu Mukherjee cited India's GDP growth rates of four years from 2022-2025 and said: ""I'm not sure that 7.7%, 6.3%, 6.2% and 6.6% is exactly holding something back.""""In a kind of abstract sense, one would run the risk of overheating an economy if you grew at much faster rates at the size and complexity of India,"" he said.Mukherjee noted that the Indian government has recently modified its tax collection systems and ""those have also certainly helped and given a more stable playing field for businesses and other initiatives to progress."" Highlighting risks facing the economy, he said some of those risks are more global in nature.""India still remains a very largely farm-based economy in many senses. And being in the tropics, it is very vulnerable to climate change. El Nino is a recurrent phenomenon but exacerbated by climate change. So should there be a shock to agricultural production, this could cause a major disruption in the economy."" Mukherjee said that while he doesn't anticipate such a shock, ""but should there be one, this could be problematic.""One of the reasons that the consumer price index in India remained relatively within bounds, allowing the central bank to not raise interest rates too much, was that food prices and fuel prices remained relatively stable. So any shock on those lines would boomerang through the economy,"" he said.Consumer price inflation in India is expected to decelerate from 5.7 per cent in 2023 to 4.5 per cent in 2024, staying within the two to six per cent medium-term inflation target range set by the Central Bank.""The risk of a surge in inflation in the coming months cannot be ruled out, however, as potential increases in commodity prices and the adverse impact of climate events on food prices could disrupt the pace of disinflation,"" the report said.The labour market situation in South Asia remained fragile in 2023 despite improvements in some countries.In India, labour market indicators improved over the year, with labour force participation increasing in August to its highest rate since the onset of the pandemic, the report said, citing the Reserve Bank of India.The unemployment rate averaged 7.1 per cent in September, the lowest value in a year, with unemployment in rural areas falling despite weaker monsoon rains. Youth unemployment rates declined significantly during the first quarter of 2023 to the lowest value since the pandemic, it said.The report also noted that the Reserve Bank of India has been cautious about opening the country's financial markets and has been implementing appropriate risk management systems.The UN said global economic growth is projected to slow from an estimated 2.7 per cent in 2023 to 2.4 per cent in 2024, trending below the pre-pandemic growth rate of three per cent.This latest forecast comes on the heels of global economic performance exceeding expectations in 2023. However, last year's stronger-than-expected GDP growth masked short-term risks and structural vulnerabilities, it said.The better-than-expected performance for 2023 is chiefly driven by several large economies, notably the US but also Brazil, India and Mexico, Mukherjee told reporters.The UN's flagship economic report presents a sombre economic outlook for the near term. Persistently high interest rates, further escalation of conflicts, sluggish international trade, and increasing climate disasters, pose significant challenges to global growth.The year ""2024 must be the year when we break out of this quagmire. By unlocking big, bold investments we can drive sustainable development and climate action, and put the global economy on a stronger growth path for all,"" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said."

The Assembly poll results in five states have fostered confidence in people with a sense of certainty for the 2024 general elections. A decisive NDA mandate is expected to ensure policy continuity, prioritise infrastructure, enhance domestic industry confidence in manufacturing investments, leading to increased financial market activity.Apart from India elections, there are also hopes of the US Fed refraining from further rate hikes. These factors have injected significant momentum into the market, prompting those who missed the April rally to start opening demat accounts, analysts added.In 2023, both the Sensex and the Nifty advanced 18.8 percent and 20 percent while BSE MidCap and BSE SmallCap jumped 45.5 percent and 47.5 percent.Palviya added that the market is expected to remain bullish despite recent volatility and profit-taking. It's advisable for investors to stay invested and consider deploying funds into quality stocks during corrections. Several sectors such as FMCG, IT, chemical, and fertiliser are yet to participate in the rally, indicating potential opportunities in the market. Palvia anticipates the Nifty to potentially reach the 23,500 level.Few analysts further said the surge in demat accounts followed a wave of profitable IPOs in recent months, enticing widespread participation. Small investors sought to capitalise on these opportunities. Also, mutual funds have outperformed the benchmarks, yielding better returns than traditional savings, attracting both passive and active public interest. ""The recognition of a bullish market fuelled the fear of missing out (FOMO), driving the December spike in demat accounts,"" said an analyst.Additionally, bank-led brokers attracted a larger customer base by offering three-in-one account facilities amid the booming equity markets, further encouraging investment.""People who were waiting on the sidelines to participate in markets are now in a hurry. Reaching 20 crs demat account in another 12 months looks achievable,"" said Prashant Bhansali, director of Mehta Equities.Analysts expect a continued surge in demat accounts due to greater recognition of equities in investment portfolios. Increased disposable income and savings among millennials have notably driven interest in financial markets.

So, at the current time, 7 percent is a conservative estimate,"" Patra had said.Further, the finance ministry also sees growth ""comfortably"" exceeding its forecast of 6.5 percent, although it has refrained from providing a fresh numerical estimate."

Elucidating this is the statement by Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkin, a voting member of the FOMC this year, “…I fear more will have to happen on the demand side, whether organically or through Fed action, to convince price-setters that the inflation era is over.”It is not surprising therefore that US financial markets reversed the trends seen at the close of 2023! Equities have remained subdued while bond yields started to climb again, after closing below 4 per cent in 2023. Markets are perhaps finding a balance from their earlier assumptions of early and rapid pace of rate cuts! In fact, most analysts now point to June for the first rate cut, as opposed to March that was envisaged earlier.  Perhaps, it is the “no-bust cycle” that is worrisome. In another FT article (specially for MCPro subscribers), columnist Ruchir Sharma highlights how when interest rates rose so sharply, it seemed almost certain that indebted businesses would fail quickly, consumers would hunker down immediately, markets would tank, recession would strike, and the world would face a classic bust in 2023.But the US economy has proved remarkably resilient, so have some emerging markets such as India, with others such as Japan waking up to growth after a prolonged recession. Besides, the geopolitical developments across the world also have increased uncertainties with respect to economic growth. So, it is not alarming that policy makers across countries are turning cautious and cognizant of developing risks to the economy that could derail gains from rate cuts on inflation.In other words, 2024 could well be a year to turn cautious on equities after witnessing stellar gains in the year just gone by. Sharma’s article that highlights 10 top global trends that could impact investing, offers interesting insights.After starting on a sombre note in 2024, Indian equities however,  recovered in today’s trading session. While investors may wait for the Fed January policy meeting outcome, the December quarter earnings season that is set to unfold soon, could also swing investor sentiment in the near term.Investing insightsBosch is cruising along the growth highwayWhat can investors expect from FMCG companies in the December ’23 quarter?Ujjivan SFB – is there headroom for more gainsWhat else are we reading?For diagnostic companies acquisitions have become integral to growth strategiesThe Green Pivot: India’s solar energy capacity is growing but challenges remainPersonal Finance | Stay with your investment strategy amid market euphoriaWide state bond yield spread benefits investors but won’t hurt states muchBudget Snapshot | How does India compare with East and Southeast Asian nations on government spending? Steel industry faces a new risk on the horizon Will traction in 2W sales alleviate concerns of K-shaped recovery?Teesta Water Sharing: An Indian failure allows China to play knight in shining armourRam Mandir inauguration and the effect on votersMarketsSME IPOs: Here are 7 tips to tell the good from the badSharp volatility, correction likely ahead of Q3 results; Vix jumps, be cautious on leveraged stocks Personal FinanceCyber frauds: How to avoid losing money to fraudstersTechnical picks: Divis Lab, UCO Bank, LTI Mindtree, Turmeric, and Tech Mahindra (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Vatsala KamatMoneycontrol Pro"

They did not name any of the companies that might be involved.The consortium would also look at diversifying India's coking coal imports.""The idea is to get the best price and look beyond Australia to diversify the imports basket,"" one of the sources said.The federal Ministry of Steel didn't immediately reply to an email seeking comments.In November, Australia assured India of steady supplies of coking coal, but supplies are still patchy.India would source more coking coal from Russia to make up for the sporadic Australian supplies, the sources said. The other advantage of buying from Moscow is that Russian supplies are cheaper than Australian cargoes, they said.Before the consortium takes shape, the government will soon formally resume talks with Mongolia for sourcing coking coal, the sources said.Mongolia, rich in mineral resources and a landlocked country that neighbours China and Russia, is yet to find a viable route to transport the raw material into India, the sources said."

And for a country such as India, where the availability of water is increasing, to still import pulses is not respectable,"" Shah said at the launch of the portal in the Capital.""That is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants India to be self-reliant when it comes to pulses by 2027,"" the home and cooperation minister added, calling on the farmers present at the portal launch to take on the challenge of producing enough pulses in the coming years that India would not need to import even a single kilogram of the staple starting from January 1, 2028.A shortfall in domestic production has led to a sharp increase in prices of pulses, especially tur dal, in India.

OFS in NLC India is likely. MDL and IRFC are also there. The OFS route will be to sell not more than 10 percent government stake in these PSUs.

A 10 percent sale of stakes in these three companies may fetch the government a maximum of Rs 21,200 crore, based on the current market prices of their shares.Shares of NLC, a producer of lignite and coal with a market capitalisation of about Rs 32,585 crore, have gained 80 percent over the past three months.

407,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/budget-2024-gdp-growth-tax-collections-relationship-is-now-complicated-11995461.html,Budget 2024: GDP growth-tax collections relationship is now complicated,"January 04, 2024 07:17 PM IST","The finance ministry makes its projections for next year's tax collections based on how fast it thinks the Indian economy will grow in nominal terms. But if the experience of 2023-24 is anything to go by, the relationship that existed between the two seems to have become more complicated and could present a challenge in crunching the numbers for the 2024-25 interim Budget","The finance ministry's weeks-long labour will bear fruit when Nirmala Sitharaman presents the 2024-25 interim Budget in Parliament on February 1. And while it may only be an interim Budget, the underlying numbers may not change much when the full Budget is presented in July 2024 by the victor of the Lok Sabha elections.The annual budget-making exercise, however, may be more difficult this time due to the diverging paths of India's nominal GDP growth and tax collection growth. In the first half of 2023-24, the nominal GDP grew by just 8.6 percent, down from 22.2 percent in April-September 2022. Despite this, gross tax collections grew by 14.7 percent in April-November, up from a 12.7 percent increase in 2022-23.Also Read: RBI model pegs India's FY25 GDP growth at 6.0% vs official view of 6.5%While the government's tax revenue does not necessarily grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, they generally move in the same direction. But as can be seen in the above chart, 2023-24 has seen nominal GDP growth take a sharp dive while tax growth has actually edged up.For making the Budget, the government assumes a number for next year's nominal GDP growth – that is, GDP growth without adjusting for the rate of inflation – and uses it to predict how much its tax collections will grow. Take, for instance, the Budget for 2023-24, which assumed nominal GDP growth of 10.5 percent, with growth in gross tax revenues pegged at 10.4 percent from the revised estimate for 2022-23.""If nominal GDP growth is lower than 10.5 percent but tax collections meet Budget estimates, then we can clearly see buoyancy is high,"" a senior finance ministry official said on the condition of anonymity.Tax buoyancy is the ratio of growth in tax collections to nominal GDP. As such, the buoyancy is said to be greater than 1 when tax collections grow faster than nominal GDP.Rise in tax buoyancyTax collections this year have indeed been impressive, with the available numbers, so far, suggesting a tax buoyancy of 1.7 – far higher than the average of 1.2 across the five pre-pandemic years from 2014-15 to 2018-19.But why is the tax buoyancy so high this year? According to economists and tax experts, compliance is playing a big role in garnering direct taxes. Within this segment, corporate tax collections – which are up 20 percent year-on-year in April-November – require a deeper explanation.A fall in input costs has boosted corporate earnings. According to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) analysis of the performance of listed non-financial companies from the private sector, the growth in their operating profits jumped nearly five times to 26.2 percent in July-September 2023 from 5.3 percent the previous quarter. This is leading to stronger growth in corporate tax collections than nominal GDP growth and also somewhat explains the far higher real GDP growth rate of 7.6 percent in the second quarter of 2023-24 than what most economists and even the RBI expected.According to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, the Centre's direct tax collections in 2023-24 may exceed the Budget estimate by around Rs 85,000 crore. The budgeted tax buoyancy is usually rather different from the actual.But can't the 2024-25 Budget just assume a higher tax buoyancy and account for any possible differences in the nominal GDP growth and tax growth numbers? Sure, but as the chart above shows, it is notoriously difficult to correctly predict how buoyant tax collections will be.The growth conundrumA fall in input costs for companies this year is also reflected in the wholesale inflation numbers. In the first eight months of 2023-24, Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation has averaged -1.3 percent. And while it finally exited the deflationary zone in November, rising to 0.26 percent and is seen increasing further in December and beyond, economists see it averaging under 1 percent for the financial year as a whole.But why does WPI inflation matter here? Because its progression is a key input in forecasting nominal GDP growth for the year as WPI inflation forms the majority of the GDP deflator – used to adjust nominal GDP to arrive at real growth. Of course, the issues with India's current GDP deflator are well known, with the government currently working on a Producer Price Index.But there are issues too with how India measures its nominal GDP. Following the release of the excellent July-September 2023 GDP data, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran had said that when the tax buoyancy is as high as it currently is ""then it is quite possible that we are not measuring the economy's underlying momentum and activity and dynamism as we should be"".""These are real numbers. These are cash flow statements put out by companies... It behooves us to consider the possibility that the economy could be actually growing far better than what we are actually measuring,"" the government's top economist had said.Also Read: Finance ministry may assume nominal GDP growth of 11% for FY25Where does that leave the government's Budget math? Well, no one will really complain as long as tax collections grow more than estimated.""If the Budget is being balanced within the estimates, then we are good,"" the aforementioned finance ministry source said.However, the disconnect between growth in nominal GDP and tax collections does raise issues about the sanctity of the Budget numbers."

The message that Yao Wen wants to send across is that while Hasina’s inevitable reelection might be seen as a diplomatic triumph for India, China enjoys even greater leverage in Bangladesh as a dependable development partner Dhaka turns to when India lets it down.The objective of the assertive messaging by China so close to voting in the general elections is to give a big boost to its image in Bangladesh, and possibly other South Asian nations, at the cost of India’s.A Dhaka Jolt To IndiaImportantly, Dhaka unhesitatingly validated Chinese ambassador Yao Wen’s announcement when it could have easily played it down. Obviously, Dhaka did that to convey its own dissatisfaction with New Delhi for not putting its house in order and signing the Teesta water sharing agreement in all these years.But the Hasina government also knows what’s good for it. When Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Saheli Sabrin, was asked at the weekly media briefing about Wen’s loaded remarks, she immediately vouched for Yao Wen’s statement regarding Dhaka seeking Beijing’s assistance in the multipurpose Teesta River management project.But when a reporter pinned down Sabrin and specifically asked whether India’s concerns over awarding projects to China so close to its frontier were factored in before approaching China, the spokesperson retorted defensively that “geopolitical issues” would certainly be taken into account by the Hasina government.It is quite natural for Bangladesh to try to strike a balance between implacable foes China and India in order to keep both happy in its own interests. Hasina cannot get re-elected without New Delhi’s backing. But after becoming the PM for a fourth straight term with India’s blessings following the January 7 polls, she would still need Chinese funding to reinvigorate the economy to sustain the momentum of growth at over six percent which was the saving grace of her authoritarian rule since 2009.Regardless of Yao Wen’s motives, let’s not doubt for even a moment the acute resentment in the neighbouring country over New Delhi’s failure to sign the Teesta treaty which would have given Bangladesh 37.5 percent of the trans-border river’s waters, leaving 42.5 percent for upper riparian India and the final 20 percent remaining in the river to maintain the ecological balance.The water-sharing formula of the Teesta River, which enters Bangladesh from West Bengal, was finalised in 2011 itself. But the treaty is on hold indefinitely because of India’s fractious politics, or to be more precise, the unbridgeable differences between Modi and Mamata Banerjee. Modi is all for the Teesta treaty, just like Manmohan Singh before him, but Banerjee is vehemently against it – and it can’t be signed until she has a change of heart.Teesta: North Bangladesh’s LifelineWith New Delhi and Kolkata pulling in different directions, the denial of the due share of Teesta waters is ruining the economy of five northern Bangladesh districts:  Rangpur, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Dinajpur, and Bogra. According to a 2013 report of Asia Foundation, nearly 21 million people depend directly or indirectly on the Teesta for their livelihoods, and the river’s flood plain cover roughly 14 percent of the total cropped area of Bangladesh. Because of the acute water scarcity during the dry season and floods during monsoons, the region is well and truly doomed.It is hardly surprising that the Bangladesh government is trying to overcome the dire situation by building key infrastructure on its side of the water-starved Teesta River running downstream from India. Bangladesh has made elaborate plans to revive the river with the help of a billion-dollar Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project (TRCMRP). According to Bangladeshi officials, the river restoration project will involve the construction of reservoirs to store water, dredging, land reclamation, erosion control and river bank protection.Yao Wen was referring to the talks underway between the Bangladesh Water Board and Power Construction Corporation of China over the TRCMRP when he announced that Dhaka had turned to Beijing for help in the Teesta basin. The Bangladesh government might have been caught off guard but it was in no position to contradict him as he had after all spoken the truth.As India has brought this situation upon itself, the remedy is also in New Delhi’s hands. If we are serious about stopping China from building a base in northern Bangladesh, we should immediately address our friendly neighbour’s legitimate water and food security concerns by fast-tracking the signing of the Teesta treaty. To keep China out of Bangladesh, New Delhi and Kolkata must resolve their differences over the Teesta treaty in the federal spirit of the Constitution – and give Bangladesh the share of water it is rightfully entitled to under international laws.SNM Abdi is an independent journalist specialising in India’s foreign policy and domestic politics.

In most interim Budgets they just repeat things that they had in their election manifestos,” said veteran economist and former finance secretary and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia.The vote on account is an interim Budget through which the incumbent government seeks Parliament's approval for expenditure required to run till the new government is in place.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on December 7 said that the Union Budget on February 1, 2024, from the NDA government is unlikely to hold any ""spectacular announcements"".She added that the regular Budget will be presented in July and ""you will have to wait till then.""Speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry’s Global Economic Policy Forum 2023 in New Delhi, Sitharaman said, ""I don’t want to be a spoilsport, but the 1st February Budget is just a vote on account; a Budget to meet expenditure till the next government comes to power. No spectacular announcements, you will have to wait till after the general election.""R Gandhi, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said, ""It is only vote on account, not budget. So don't expect any policy initiatives.""Sitharaman, while presenting Budget 2021-22, had announced the privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs) as part of the disinvestment drive to garner Rs 1.75 lakh crore.The FM had then said that other than IDBI Bank the government proposes to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in 2021-22. But this announcement wasn’t followed up.""Every government makes the decisions at the right time. So, I don't think that anything is going to happen before the general elections,"" a finance ministry official said.Current situation of public sector banksIndustry experts believe that banks are currently in good stead and earning profits.""There is no chance to touch issues like bank privatisation in the interim Budget. Banks’ situation is quite favourable thanks to the earning improvements of banks. Some banks have also been able to raise good funds and their capital position appears quite nice, it's in profitable mode, said former finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg.India's banking sector, in the July-September FY24 quarter, saw double-digit profits and improvement in asset quality, according to a Moneycontrol analysis. Additionally, some major banks reported a contraction in their net interest margins (NIM).Among major banks, the State Bank of India (SBI) reported a net profit of Rs 14,330 crore in the July-September FY24 quarter. Bank of Baroda’s (BoB) profit after tax stood at Rs 4,253 crore while Punjab National Bank reported a 327 percent rise in net profit at Rs 1,756 crore for the latest July-September quarter.""The public sector banks have served as the backbone of the financial sector in India and will continue to do so. With rapid economic growth in the country, private sector banks have more than enough space to explore and flourish,"" said Charan Singh Non-Executive Chairman of Punjab & Sind Bank.Singh said banks are in a very healthy situation in India and are expected to continue that trend. The interest rate cycle can change in 2024-25 but given the buffers, banks will be able to fend for themselves."

On the first day of trading, Apple experienced a significant setback, losing $100 billion in market capitalization and triggering a 1.6 percent drop in the Nasdaq. The 3.6 percent loss in Apple's stock value was attributed to Barclays downgrading the stock to ""underweight."" The downgrade cited disappointing iPhone 15 sales and a bleak outlook for Apple's hardware business.Beyond Apple, Intel also played a role in the index's decline, falling 4.9 percent along with other chip makers. This downturn followed an announcement by Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker ASML, stating it would restrict shipments of certain technology to China at the Dutch government's request.The repercussions extended to the Indian market, where the IT sector experienced a more than 2 percent fall on Wednesday. Despite a recent rally in IT stocks in India over the past three months, the Nasdaq drop and the upcoming earnings season are expected to limit upward movements in the sector.Broking firms are exercising caution due to the recent outperformance making IT stocks more expensive. Bloomberg data reveals that the Nifty IT index trades at 26.4 times its one-year forward earnings, a 31 percent premium to the benchmark Nifty and significantly above the five-year mean.Expectations for the IT sector remain subdued, with most analysts anticipating low single-digit revenue growth in the December quarter. This is attributed to reduced discretionary spending by clients and higher-than-expected furloughs during the quarter.The hiring outlook for IT companies in 2024 is also conservative, withreports suggesting a reduction in freshers hiring from 2.3 lakh in the previous year to 1.55 lakh in FY2023-24. Notably, Infosys has decided not to visit college campuses for hiring freshers. Major companies like Google, Amazon, Meta, and Apple have also slowed their hiring in India, with job openings decreasing by 90 percent since 2022.While the outlook for IT stocks' performance is not optimistic, attention is focused on guidance and management commentary. A potential surprise in the sector could be in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) space. In 2023, AI gained significant attention with platforms like Chat GPT.

The latest data and the impending earnings season appear to be driving investor caution.The December 2023 automobile wholesale dispatches lagged the Street's estimates. Sales at Maruti Suzuki, the largest seller of passenger vehicles, declined by 5.9 percent in India. Sales of passenger cars dropped by a sharp 28.7 percent indicating muted demand for entry level and compact vehicles. While Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra reported a decent growth in passenger vehicle sales, the growth is primarily led by electric and utility vehicles.Soft demand for passenger cars is feared to weigh on industry growth in 2024 calendar year. Nomura Research revised downwards their passenger vehicle industry growth forecast for FY25. “We are cautious about the passenger vehicle growth outlook due to a slowdown in demand trends and a high base,” added analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.The patchy demand narrative extends beyond the automobile sector. Consumer staples companies are facing softer demand trends in rural areas.According to Nuvama Institutional Equities, demand during winter and festive months are weaker than expected for most fast-moving consumer goods companies. The demand softness in rural areas may persist for some time, weighing down industry growth. “Upcoming general elections and a further reduction in inflation are likely to lead to a gradual improvement in FY25. However, we estimate Q3FY24 and Q4FY24 to stay challenging for the sector in terms of volume growth,” warn analysts at Nuvama.Amid the slowing volume growth, industry leader Hindustan Unilever (HUL) has changed the margin structure for its distributors, stoking their ire. Perhaps, HUL changed the margin structure to nudge the distributors to sell its products more aggressively. Read Ravi Ananthanarayanan’s analysis of the dispute here.Adding to investors' caution is the projection of a weak earnings season for the IT services sector.

The US has agreed to grant market access to steel and aluminium products under the exclusion process of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962.This market access has restored opportunities for Indian steel and aluminium exporters, which were restricted since June 14, 2018, because of the US 232 measure under which additional duties were levied on steel and aluminium products respectively.The additional tariffs had impacted USD 1.21 billion worth of India's exports of steel and aluminium to the US in 2018. The duty burden on exports due to additional US tariffs amounted to USD 241 million.The US had settled a similar dispute with Canada and Mexico at the end of 2019.

The guidelines finally came into effect on January 1, after being delayed several times.As per the notification, producers and importers of all items will now have to mention the price of the product per unit along with the total maximum retail price (MRP) as well as the exact month and year of manufacturing.According to the new rule, manufacturers and importers now need to mention the unit price per kg or litre for items weighing more than a kg or litre. Similarly, for items weighing less than a kg or litre, the unit price has to be mentioned per gram or millilitre (ml). For pre-packed items with a length of more than one metre, the unit price will be per metre, and for items less than one metre, it will be per cm.“For items sold by number, the number of unit, piece, pair, set, or such other word that represents the quantity in the package shall be mentioned,” the notice further reads.The Ministry of Consumer Affairs. Food and Public Distribution first issued the notification in November 2021 and set April 2022 as the deadline for enforcement. “However, the date was extended at least three times in consultation with the industry as they requested more time to make these changes,” an official said.“While there were still requests for further delay in the implementation of the order, we could not entertain them any longer. Those who are willing have already made the changes required,” the official added.Per the official, “These rules will bring in more transparency for the buyers as they may be able to choose the best price per unit quantity, which as of now was difficult to determine with only MRPs for the entire package being made available.”Recently, the ministry also tightened the screws on the construction sector, mandating that welding electrodes must be sold in kilograms instead of pieces/numbers and issued notices to tile companies, asking them to mention tile sizes on the boxes."

Export of diesel, ATF and petrol attract the levy if product cracks (or margins) rise above $20 per barrel. Product cracks or margins are the difference between crude oil (raw material) and finished petroleum products.Concerns over demand due to a weaker global economy and rising crude inventories in the US have led to lower crude prices in November and December. Experts believe that only geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could drive up oil prices. Lower demand and higher oil output are expected to weigh on crude oil prices in early 2024. Demand from China, which is the largest energy consumer in the world, has not recovered amid the economic slowdown in the country..In December, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies (OPEC+) voluntarily agreed to cut output by nearly 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by early 2024, taking the total cut in production above 2.2 million bpd, or about 2 percent of the world supply, to support crude prices. Even as Saudi Arabia and Russia have taken the lead in implementing supply cuts, many other countries have increased their output.Recently, oil prices witnessed a temporary spike amid attacks by Yemen-based Houthi rebels on Israel-bound cargo ships in the Red Sea. The waterway includes the Suez Canal, an arterial east-west trading route, which accounts for 10 percent of the world's oil, grain, and consumer goods shipments. Following the attacks leading shipping firms are temporarily avoiding the Red Sea, a vital waterway for commerce between Europe and Asia.India imposed a windfall tax on crude oil producers in July 2022 and extended the levy on exports of gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel as private refiners wanted to sell fuel overseas to make gains from robust refining margins instead of selling locally."

Speculation was mainly focused on whether it would be mild or strong. The data on charts was pointing to it as a near certainty. But that recession never came. Sure, growth slowed down, interest rates tightened but not enough to throttle growth to an extent that equities wilted under pressure.While global equities did well, domestic equity investors earned good returns too with large, mid and small caps returning splendid returns. The latter two categories delivered much higher returns than the first one. Even gold delivered a positive return. The tightening of interest rates during 2023 meant that long-tenure holdings suffered but shorter-tenure instruments earned more. Some deft portfolio management should have ensured good returns for fixed-income investors too. Healthy actual user demand even supported real estate prices in some if not all markets. This was a year when serendipity could easily be mistaken for investing smarts.While it’s alright to bask in a good year of returns, this is as good a time as any to revisit your assumptions, goals and portfolio allocation. If you were reasonably weighted towards small and mid-cap stocks at the start of the year, then those weights have risen considerably now. If you deliberately choose to stay the course, understanding the risks and opportunities that come with it, then that’s fine. But if you assess that the portfolio weightages could give you grief if markets enter a correction phase, or worse a drawdown, then it’s time to reallocate. And this exercise is independent of what happens to the market, specific to your own situation.What can we expect to happen in 2024? The experience of financial soothsayers from a year ago makes one wary of forming any firm opinions. Once your portfolio is rigged to withstand the volatility that’s a norm in equity markets, the right approach will be to be flexible about what can happen.The main event of 2024 is central banks of major economies making their exit from tight monetary policy, leading to lower interest rates. The resulting low cost of capital is expected to create conditions ripe for higher economic growth. And as a result, boost equities. Has this scenario been priced in? Will it play out as expected? If the recession predictors tripped unexpectedly, could the soothsayers of good times in 2024 face a similar fate?What’s certain is that equity investors’ expectations are certainly much higher now than they were a year ago. All the main events they have bunged into their mental frameworks or spreadsheets have to deliver mostly on target. For domestic investors, apart from global events and money flows, these will be corporate earnings growth trajectories, capex that lays the ground for future growth, a decline in interest rates, elections and fiscal management. A lot depends on corporate earnings’ growth surprising on the upside because even if valuations remain flat or decline a bit, earnings growth can deliver capital appreciation.Do read a balanced and in-depth take on what lies ahead for equity and fixed income investors from veteran fund manager S Krishnakumar, former CIO-Equities of Sundaram Mutual Fund, in an interview conducted by my colleague Vatsala Kamat. Here’s the cheery part: “India deserves its premium valuations, while time corrections can be expected for re-adjustments to the mean valuation. The one-year and two-year forward Nifty 50 earnings on rolling basis are estimated at about INR 1112 and INR 1282 with corresponding price-to-earnings ratio (PER) at 19.2 times and 16.6 times respectively. This compares with the average decadal PER, which has been around 18.5 times one-year forward. Looking ahead, it is not out of place to expect Indian markets to trade higher than mean given the positives outlined above.”A key takeaway from his interview is that this could be a year for stock pickers who get their bets right and not necessarily index huggers.

India also does not cut tariffs on sensitive items for even its FTA (free trade agreement) partners.The report said that this has paid India with self-sufficiency in almost all products.""India needs to continue with its current approach to not open the domestic agriculture sector to low tariff subsidised imports. Upholding high import tariffs on sensitive items and resisting pressure to open up the domestic agriculture sector to low-tariff subsidised imports will be crucial for preserving India's hard-earned self-sufficiency and ensuring food security for its burgeoning population,"" it said.According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, net cereal imports by developing countries will almost triple over the next 30 years while their net meat imports might even increase by a factor of almost five.While most countries will be dependent on food imports, India is lucky to be self-sufficient in all agriculture and food items except vegetable oils.India's agricultural imports are estimated to touch USD 33 billion in 2023 which will be just 4.9 per cent of total merchandise imports.""This has become possible due to focus on policies like the green and white revolution, high import tariffs and active negotiations at the WTO (World Trade Organisation) to protect food security concerns for the 1.4 billion people over developed country pressure to open Indian agriculture to subsidised imports,"" GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said.On the sugar sector, the report said that India is the world's largest sugar exporter after Brazil, but this year, it will import sugar in vast quantities as the sugar imports are estimated to grow steeply by 385.4 per cent, from USD 252 million in 2022 to USD 1,223.4 million in 2023.Imports have increased in 2023 due to a decline in domestic production caused by weak rains.India dominates the global sugar scene as the largest producer, consumer, and second-largest exporter. Its sugar industry, ranking second in agro-based sectors, employs millions.""Despite this, the industry faces competitiveness challenges, relying heavily on subsidies, free power, and water, leading many times to overproduction and market volatility. Water scarcity compounds issues, threatening industry sustainability,"" Srivastava said.To thrive, the Indian sugar sector must aim to boost sugarcane yield from 55 to the global average of 70 tonnes per hectare, free from subsidies.""Production uncertainties force frequent policy changes to keep local prices in control, but dissuading long-term investments and hindering strategic planning for future businesses,"" he added.Vegetable oil, pulses, and fresh and dry fruits account for 72.1 per cent of agriculture imports of India in 2023. Vegetable oil is the largest import constituent, accounting for 51.9 per cent of total agriculture imports of India.India imports 4 types of oils: Crude Palm Oil (CPO), Soya Bean Crude Oil, Crude Sunflower Seed Oil, and Refined Bleached Deodorized (RBD) Palmolein.The report said that imports in 2023 are set to decline by 18.6 per cent to USD 17.1 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to a fall in import prices, not in quantities.Further, it said that India's pulses imports are expected to rise by 44 per cent to surpass USD 2.7 billion in 2023 as compared to 2022.The major pulses and import values in 2023 are Masoor (lentil) at USD 1.13 billion, Arhar/Tuar (pigeon peas) at USD 766 million, Urad (beans of vigna mungo) at USD 536 million, Rajma (kidney beans) at USD 120 million, and Kabuli Chana at USD 76 million.India is the world's largest producer and consumer of pulses. It aims to enhance domestic production and cut imports by introducing high-yielding, disease-resistant pulse varieties.The key challenges include addressing water scarcity and mitigating market volatility issues.""Major efforts extend to reclaiming fallow land, promoting intercropping, and focusing on rainfed areas. Also, the market and infrastructure support involve ensuring fair prices through Minimum Support Price (MSP), investing in storage and processing, and establishing direct marketing channels,"" he said."

His successors have spent much of this year trying to impress one clear message on investors: interest rates will not come down until inflation has fallen sustainably to target.

Huw Pill, the Bank of England’s chief economist, found one of the most striking ways to explain this, telling a South African audience in August that central banks needed to...

Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the letter.Also Read: CBDCs — the future of international paymentsThe RBI had set itself the steep target last year, with Moneycontrol reporting in September 2023 that daily transactions averaged just 20,000-25,000 in July. Retail CBDC transaction data is not available publicly.The RBI, which launched the pilot project for the retail e-rupee on December 1, 2022, has been looking to push volumes of the digital currency so that it can learn more about how the public uses it. In recent weeks, commercial banks have even offered incentives such as cash-backs to promote the use of the retail CBDC and sign up new users.Meanwhile, on the wholesale front, the RBI has looked to expand the use case of the CBDC, and in October introduced it in the inter-bank call market. However, the number of transactions of the wholesale CBDC have been extremely few, although that has not deterred the RBI.In his letter to RBI staff, Governor Das also said the success of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) meant the model is being followed internationally. Commenting on the economy, the governor noted that the RBI had been able to ""effectively navigate"" several challenges in 2023.Also Read: India's GDP growth to 'comfortably' exceed 6.5% in FY24, says FinMin""On the monetary policy front, we have managed to moderate inflation while not losing focus on growth.

Approximately 70 countries, including India, are slated to hold general elections, introducing a potential source of heightened market volatility","Dear Reader,The equity markets concluded 2023 on a robust note, with most indices closing near their peak levels following a period of considerable strength. On December 28, 2023, the Sensex and Nifty achieved fresh record highs at 72,484.34 and 21,801.45, respectively. The year concluded with impressive gains of 18.74 percent and 20 percent for the Sensex and Nifty, respectively. Notably, smaller indices outperformed their benchmark counterparts.The Indian markets benefited from a robust domestic economy amid a global economic slowdown. Strong fund inflows from both domestic and foreign investors further contributed to the positive market sentiment. Despite high interest rates, sectors sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, such as real estate and automobiles, posted remarkable figures, underscoring the resilience of the economy.As we step into 2024, both domestic and international markets are entering a cloud of uncertainty. Approximately 70 countries, including India, are slated to hold general elections, introducing a potential source of heightened market volatility. Additionally, uncertainties persist regarding the global economic recovery, particularly with China facing ongoing challenges. Analysts anticipate central banks initiating interest rate reductions in 2024 to stimulate economic revival.The energy market takes centre stage as geopolitical tensions threaten to embroil more nations in the oil-rich Middle East. This comes when the OPEC+ oil cartel is diminishing in significance. Experts in the oil market express concerns about potential unexpected moves by the oil cartel to maintain its relevance. All eyes are keenly focused on developments in this critical sector. Can the momentum continue?Nifty has continued to rally, closing above the previous week’s high. However, we feel that the market may be running out of steam as the risk-reward at current levels is not favourable, which can result in the market making topping out in early January. Several sentiment indicators are now pointing to a risk of an important market top. Be cautious if the Nifty falls below 21200.In the recent past, Nifty swing recorded a low reading of 8 percent and went up to an overbought level of 82 percent, as seen in the chart below. Though the market dropped slightly on Friday, we should not rule out a new high in the new year. Source: web.strike.moneyClient positions representing the HNIs and retail have recently built up the largest short position since 2017. We have seen some reduction in those shorts, but the current position is still large. A large short in the past has been associated with a market top, therefore we cannot ignore this data point.Source: web.strike.moneyTraders rolled over their long positions, paying the largest premium on record. The difference between the spot and futures for Jan 2024 was 230 points at one point in time. This super high reading represents the bullish sentiment among traders to hold on to and roll over Nifty long positions. This extreme behaviour may be an early warning of a coming correction in the market.Source: web.strike.moneyOptions dataOptions data also point towards cautiousness.

The notification further said that Ritvik Ranjanam Pandey, Joint Secretary in the Department of Revenue, will be the Secretary to the commission.Panagariya, who is currently a professor of Indian political economy at Columbia University, New York, served as the first vice chairman of the NITI Aayog, a policy think tank created by the government of India and chaired by the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, from 2015 to 2017. He is also former chief economist of the Asian Development Bank and has worked with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in various capacities.The cabinet on November 29 had approved the terms of reference for the 16th Finance Commission, which will recommend how taxes are shared between the Centre and states, and also among states.The commission will also provide its recommendations on the principles that should govern the grants-in-aid of the revenues of the states out of the Consolidated Fund of India and the sums to be paid to the states by way of grants-in-aid of their revenues, among others.The panel's predecessor, the 15th Finance Commission, which was set up on November 27, 2017, was chaired by the member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, NK Singh. The recommendations of this commission is valid for a period of six years from April 1, 2020, that is till the financial year 2025-26.The finance commission normally takes about two years to make its recommendations. The Constitution says that the finance commission has to be constituted every fifth year or earlier. A working group led by finance secretary TV Somanathan was set up to assist in drawing up the terms of reference taking into account the views and suggestions from states and Union Territories.Media reports had claimed that the Terms of Reference of the 16th Finance Commission were partial and generic compared to those given to the 15th Finance Commission. Somanathan, earlier this month, said that while the terms may be shorter compared to some previous ones, the suggestions of states were taken on board."

The fact that we attempted alternatives was why we are here (bankruptcy) now,” Weerasinghe told reporters on Friday.“We have to go in the same path, say, if the period of debt restructuring allowed is 10 years – if they (opposition) want to change it, the creditors can say, we don’t support this anymore. If we were to leave the programme, we will have to pay USD 6 billion a year in repayments,” Weerasinghe said.Weerasinghe was repeating what President Wickremesinghe said on December 17. “There was no alternative to the IMF programme for the cash-strapped island nation to get out of its economic bankruptcy,” Wickremesinghe, who is also the Finance Minister, said as he responded to the strong criticism from the opposition to the reforms.The main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) has vowed to renegotiate the IMF bailout claiming that the conditions attached to it that were agreed by the president had heaped economic hardships on people.As the finance minister, Wickremesinghe was the lead in the IMF negotiations and introduced tough economic reforms such as increasing personal taxes and high utility tariffs.Further, a higher Value Added Tax net is coming into effect from January 2024 even covering items, such as fuel, which had been VAT-free.Wickremesinghe insists that his method which brought in the IMF bailout was the only method to bring long-term relief although it will cause short-term hardships.Weerasinghe, the central bank chief, said renegotiating does happen under each review of the IMF. “There was renegotiation after the first review and it will be reviewed at the time of the second review too,” he said.It was important to maintain the IMF programme to receive international support to solve the crisis, Weerasinghe said regarding the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) support the island’s economy had received since inking the IMF deal.After it was hit by its worst economic crisis in history in 2022 when its foreign exchange reserves fell to a critical low, Sri Lanka went in for what the World Bank described as “foundational reforms” to restore macroeconomic stability and mitigate the impacts on the poor and vulnerable aided by private sector-led recovery."

Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates next year as inflation moderates.Questions for 2024 will be when the Fed begins cuts, and whether the first rate reduction is made to avoid over-tightening as inflation drops, or due to rapidly slowing US economic growth.With markets already pricing in aggressive cuts, debate is also focused on how much further the dollar is likely to fall.""We've already weakened quite a bit in anticipation of a Fed cut cycle to come,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York.The dollar's decline accelerated after the Fed adopted an unexpectedly dovish tone and forecast 75 basis points in rate reductions for 2024 at its December policy meeting.Markets are pricing in even more aggressive cuts, with the first reduction seen likely in March and 154 basis points in cuts expected by year-end.The Fed's tone contrasted other major central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB) and Bank of England (BoE), which maintained they will hold rates higher for longer.But ""I do think they will capitulate. European growth is just struggling too much and inflation's coming down relatively fast, same in the U.K. in many ways,"" said Bechtel. ""If all three central banks are cutting, it's going to be very hard for the dollar to weaken significantly.""Against a basket of currencies, the greenback was little changed on December 29 at 101.18, rising from a five-month trough of 100.61 reached on December 28. It is on track to lose 2.23% this year.The euro gained 0.07% to $1.1069, hovering just below a five-month peak of $1.11395 reached on December 28. It is heading for a 3.31% gain for the year, its first positive year since 2020.""Markets are looking for a cut earlier in the US and are less certain that the European Central Bank will cut as quickly, so that's why the dollar is very soft,"" said Niels Christensen, chief analyst at Nordea.""We also have positive risk appetite which is another negative for the dollar. Going into 2024, the soft dollar will be a theme towards the March central bank meetings,"" Christensen added.Policymakers at the ECB and the BoE did not signal any imminent rate cuts at their policy meetings this month, but traders are pricing in 161 bps of cuts by the ECB next year, with the probability of two cuts by April.

Rowe Price.That said, even if the BOJ hikes rates into positive territory, they will still remain much lower than in the United States.""For all of 2024, if they got to positive 50 basis points I would be kind of surprised, but maybe that happens, and if the Fed gives us three rate cuts, you're still looking at an interest rate differential of roughly 4.5% or so, which makes the yen very expensive to own,"" said Jefferies- Bechtel.The yen is a popular funding currency, and investors use proceeds from shorting the yen to purchase other assets.Bitcoin rose 0.8% to $42,922.

The commerce ministry, on December 29, revised this figure to 12.0 percent.Output of the eight core sectors had grown by 5.7 percent in November 2022.For April-November, the core industries' production was 8.6 percent higher year-on-year as against a growth of 8.1 percent in the first eight months of 2022-23.The fall in core sector growth in November was largely due to the cement sector, whose output contracted by 3.6 percent year-on-year after it had jumped by a huge 17.4 percent in October.The performance of the other sectors in November is as follows:>> coal output up 10.9 percent as against 18.4 percent in October>> crude oil output down 0.4 percent as against a growth of 1.3 percent in October>> natural gas output up 7.6 percent as against 9.9 percent in October>> refinery products output up 12.4 percent as against 4.2 percent in October>> fertiliser output up 3.4 percent as against 5.3 percent in October>> steel output up 9.1 percent as against 10.7 percent in October>> electricity output up 5.6 percent as against 20.3 percent in OctoberWhile overall core sector output was up 7.8 percent on a year-on-year basis in November, it was down 3.4 percent from October. In fact, within the sectors, only production of coal and refinery products was higher in November on a sequential basis, with cement and electricity production down 13-14 percent month-on-month.The sequential fall in output can be explained by the fact that November had fewer working days compared to October on account of the festival season.A fall in core sector growth in November likely means industrial growth, as per the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), will also decrease once data for last month is released on January 12.""Given the larger number of factory holidays, we anticipate a modest 2-4 percent rise in the IIP in November,"" Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, said.In October, India's IIP growth surged to a 16-month high of 11.7 percent, higher than expectations and nearly double the September print of 6.2 percent, helped by a favourable base. With the eight core industries making up more than 40 percent of the weight of the IIP, the former is seen as a lead indicator of industrial growth."

Meanwhile, there was a decline in the number of life insurance policies sold to women in 2022-23. And an Indian company has figured in the list of top five companies earning the highest profit per employee globally.","Weekly Numerics column features three to five charts based on major events or interesting data points that emerged during the week. Here are some of the key figures of the past seven days.India’s logistics cost is lower than estimatedOn various occasions in recent years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari pegged India’s logistics to be around 13 to 14 percent of its GDP. In fact, Gadkari has also previously stated that the government aims to bring this figure down to nine percent by the end of 2024. However, a recent report released by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER), shows that even the upper bound estimates for India’s logistics cost have stayed within 10 percent in the 10 years.This is much lower than the figures that have been touted in the public discourse so far. In 2021-22 the logistics cost was estimated to have been between 7.8 and 8.9 percent of the GDP, lower than the estimated cost of 8.1 percent to 9.2 percent the year before.The NCAER study looked at data from 2011-12 to 2021-22. However, the years 2019-20 and 2020-21, being abnormal years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, have been excluded from the study.The government had rolled out the National Logistics Policy and PM Gati Shakti project to cut down on logistics costs and stated the aim of bringing them down to single digits.Decline in life insurance policies sold to womenThe share of life insurance policies issued to women in the total number of policies sold in India slightly decreased from 34.7 percent in 2021-22 to 34.2 percent in 2022-23, a study conducted by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) showed.Out of a total of 28.4 million policies sold in the country in 2022-23, only around 9.74 million were sold to women. The share of policies sold to women by the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was higher at 35.81 percent, compared to the share of women among policies sold by private life insurance companies (30.13 percent).Among states, the share of women in policies issued was the highest in Karnataka, Kerala and Mizoram, as can be seen from the chart below.Meanwhile, the bottom five among states and Union territories in the list included Ladakh, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat.IRDAI considered data on the number of policies and first-year premiums for the year 2022-23 for its study.Electricity to see recovery in DecemberThe daily data on power consumption released by the Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO) shows that as much as 119.6 billion kWh (kilowatt-hour) of electricity was consumed in November. However, this figure is expected to be revised up in the final figure, which according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) will touch 121 billion kWh.This is a significant decline from the 139.8 billion kWh of electricity consumed in October. Although November has historically been marked by a decline in electricity consumption, the fall this year is expected to be steeper than previous years.The first 21 days of December have seen 85 billion kWh of electricity being consumed. Considering that electricity consumption usually picks up towards the end of December, possibly due to the dipping temperatures as well as Christmas and New Year festivities, the final figure for the month is expected to reach 128 billion kWh. This is a sequential growth of 5.7 percent from the estimate for November.“These numbers reflect a 9.5 percent year-on-year growth in November and a 4.7 percent growth in December. This estimated growth suggests a loss of momentum in electricity consumption. These growth rates are not as high as the double-digit growth witnessed in the past few months. In the period July through October, the growth rates ranged between 11.5 and 22.6 percent, compared to the previous year,” said CMIE in an analysis report.The Indian company earning a profit of $1.3 million per employeeFortune 500 companies collectively earned a revenue of $41 trillion in FY23, amassing a whopping $2.9 trillion in profit. Having a collective workforce of more than 700 million, these companies clocked an average profit per employee of $41,300.However, some companies raked in more profits per employee than others. The Danish trading company Energi Danmark Group led the list by far, earning $5.7 million in profit per employee, according to a report published by AgencyReviews, an online marketplace that matches brands and agencies.Rajesh Exports, an India based gold refiner and manufacturer of gold-based products, also figured in the list of top five companies earning the highest profit per employee. The gold giant, which processes about 35 percent of gold produced in the world, raked in a profit of $200 million from just 135 employees during the fiscal year. This means that the company earned a profit of $1.3 million per employee.Sector-wise, household products, energy, and technology emerged as top performers among the lot with average profits per employee of $89.82k, $80.51k, and $76.58k, respectively.Although the financial sector was the most represented in the list, with as many as 101 companies, the sector also showcased considerable efficiency, with an average profit per employee of $62,000, surpassing the global average of $41,300."

Total receipts, meanwhile, were up 19 percent YoY in April-November at Rs 17.46 lakh crore, thanks to a 43 percent increase in non-tax revenue on account of the huge surplus transferred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in May.Also Read: How RBI's dividend gives Centre a much-needed helping handIn fact, the Centre's non-tax revenue in April-November, at Rs 2.84 lakh crore, has almost matched the entire collection for 2022-23 and is now only Rs 17,285 crore away from this year's target with four months still to go.But it was from taxes that the government's bottomline benefitted the most, as net tax revenue in November recorded a growth of 149 percent, while gross tax collections were up 21 percent YoY at Rs 2.08 lakh crore.The huge growth in November in net tax collections was due to the Centre transferring a larger amount of money to states in November 2022 (Rs 1.17 lakh crore) compared to Rs 72,961 crore in November 2023.Transfers to states as tax devolution reduce the Centre's net tax collections.Also Read: Centre transfers Rs 1.46 lakh crore as tax devolution to states in DecemberThe impressive increase in gross tax collections in November was primarily due to corporate tax collections increasing by 84 percent YoY, while personal income tax collections rose a more sedate 13 percent. For April-November as a whole, the corporate tax mop-up stands at Rs 5.14 lakh crore, 20 percent higher YoY, while personal income tax collections are up 29 percent at Rs 5.67 lakh crore.As per the 2023-24 budget, the Centre's target for corporate and personal income tax collections is Rs 9.23 lakh crore and Rs 9.01 lakh crore, respectively. Meanwhile, the budget target for net tax collections is Rs 23.31 lakh crore. In April-November, the Centre's net tax collections amount to Rs 14.36 lakh crore.The government gets two big installments of advance tax in the months of December and March.The latest set of numbers on the government's finances will further add to the finance ministry's confidence that it will comfortably meet its fiscal deficit target of 5.9 percent of GDP for 2023-24. The budget for 2024-25, which will be presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1, 2024, is expected to announced a sizable reduction in the fiscal deficit for next year on the way to meeting the target of 4.5 percent of GDP for 2025-26."

As 2023 comes to an end, the temptation to lose oneself reminiscing about the months gone by is strong. Stronger is the urge to expect all the good things to continue into the new year. It may look like India can jolly well afford to rest on its laurels and expect good things to turn spectacular in 2024. But hold that thought. The test for investors is to decide what to let go and what to hold on.  2023 was in all respects a Goldilocks year for the country, brightened with a resilient economy that surprised on growth, a stock market that attracted flows like there is no tomorrow, a bond market that got a seat at the global table and a monetary policy that succeeded in bringing demand-driven inflation down. The cherry on top of this Goldilocks cake was a fortified banking sector, joined by an ebullient bunch of non-bank lenders, eager to lend to everyone.  More than investors, the country’s central bank seemed gung-ho about the economy. “Against this challenging global backdrop, the Indian economy exhibits macroeconomic resilience, with a robust financial system that is supporting its growth dynamics,” Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das wrote in the foreword of the latest financial stability report.  India was indeed a bright star, as described by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The New Year, though, would be treacherous in terms of expectations and meeting them.  Radhika Gupta MD and CEO of Edelweiss Mutual Fund sums up the job of an investor in 2024 in an interview with Moneycontrol, “I think the biggest problem in 2024 is going to be one of expectations…. People should moderate their portfolios now.” For all the optimism, there are several spots of trouble on the horizon. Here we can take the help of the central bank, which has done its job by warning about these pitfalls. Global risks remain in the form of unfolding geopolitical events such as wars, supply disruptions and a weakened banking system in major economies. Add the overhang of an unprecedented level of government debt across many sovereigns. All this will continue to exert pressure on the Indian economy’s prospects through the channels of trade, finance, and sentiment.  Onshore, there are risks emerging for domestic lenders. Unsecured lending has gone out of whack, though the RBI has nipped some of the trouble in the bud through increasing risk weights. Non-bank finance companies, or the shadow banks, have gone hammer and tongs in grabbing high-yielding high risk borrowers and have also resorted to questionable practices along the way such as evergreening of loans and roundtripping of funds through alternative investment funds (AIF). Our Chart of the Day captures the worrying rise of unsecured lending of NBFCs here. Banks have never been better, but the RBI still wants them to be cautious and be aware of the risks from vulnerable loan segments. Our piece on the financial stability report’s warnings lists out why the RBI is right to be cautious.  Governance and risk management continue to be an area where the regulator’s expectations have not been met.Investors must take a close look at their own expectations and examine whether they can stand up against potential risks. Not all parts of the economy are meeting the hopes of Indians. Household leverage has increased and not all the borrowing is going towards consumption. Small businesses are still struggling amid rising interest rates. Soon, the cumulative policy rate hikes of the past would show up through dampened demand. Rural India is also bracing for El Nino and a loss of output. Indeed, amid the robust economic growth, farm sector output was at a multi-year low in July-September quarter. Outlook on income and wages has improved but there is still plenty of room here.   As Ananya Roy explains in her round-up of 2023 for the markets, “It is only when all segments of the economy – broad-based domestic demand, export demand, government expenditure, and private investments – are poised for growth, that the expectations-based rally seen in the second half of 2023 can transform into a fundamentals-based rally in 2024.” What works for India is the changing perception among foreign investors and its own emergence as an alternative to China. China’s growth troubles could keep crude oil under check, benefiting net importers like India. The US may dodge a recession even as the Federal Reserve brings out its shears to cut rates.  So, it is time to let go of the fear surrounding the world economy. But with it, we should also let go of unreasonable expectations. Only then can we bank on 2024 being a year of hard-earned stability.  Investing insightsKIMS: Why we remain on the sidelinesWeekly Tactical Pick: This digital map-maker deserves a fresh lookWhat are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Cashbacks in small caps, Mogul’s railway trip, IPO fine printNeeded, an industrial policy that spurs manufacturing and jobs too Why Indian boards should understand power and influence of GEMZ?China’s weaponisation of rare earths threatens a crisisInside Nio: Electric car group’s boss William Li and his fight for survival(republished from FT)Global Economy 2024: Positives in macro outlook outweighing uncertainties, India in a position to dream bigVijayakanth: 'Black' MGR who dared to take a plunge in TN politics & made a differenceQatar commutes ex-Naval officers' death sentence, India’s blooming ties with Arab nations hailedTechnical picks: Apar Industries, ICICI Bank, Jindal Steel, Bharat Forge, and Natural Gas (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app). Aparna IyerMoneycontrol Pro "

This rise in income tax collections is due to the increasing income of individuals.According to reports, net direct tax collections after adjusting for refunds have grown from Rs 6.38 lakh crore in FY 2013-14 to Rs 16.61 lakh crore in FY 2022-23.

In 2019, the government offered a lower rate of tax for corporations who forego exemptions. A similar scheme was introduced for individuals in April 2020. In the 2023-24 Budget, the new income tax regime for individuals was made more attractive by rationalising the tax slabs, raising the basic exemption limit to Rs 3 lakh, and including a standard deduction of Rs 50,000.

The move to bring foreign credit card spending under LRS would have also meant that taxes collected at Source (TCS) would be required to be deducted at the time of making payments. Banks also conveyed that there would be compliance issues while deducting the TCS, and subsequently, the government had to defer the implementation of the proposal.Also Read | Budget 2024-25: Net direct tax collections for FY24 jumps nearly 21% to Rs 13.70 lakh croreThe number of ITRs filed by individual taxpayers has increased from 3.36 crore in 2013-14 to 6.37 crore in 2021-22, indicating a widening of the tax base after various reform measures put in place by the Income Tax Department. In 2023-24, 7.41 crore returns have been filed till October 26, 2023, including 53 lakh returns by first-time filers.On February 1, the government will present a vote on account as general elections are due in April-May. The full Budget is likely to be presented in July 2024 by the new government to be formed after the elections. Lisation of the tax administrations and continued focus on formalisation of the economy have contributed to higher tax compliance rates.It has been reported that direct tax collections have grown at around 20% in the current fiscal year (April-March), and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections have also been scaling a new peak every year. This trend is expected to continue in 2024 due to a strong economic performance. In April 2023, the monthly GST collection reached a high of Rs 1.87 lakh crore. The average gross monthly GST collection in 2023-24 stands at Rs 1.66 lakh crore, an 11% increase from the previous financial year.The GST Council recently clarified that a 28% tax will be levied on the full amount put in at the time of entry into online gaming platforms. Additionally, the council has made it mandatory for all overseas online gaming companies to register with GST authorities. GST authorities have issued 71 show-cause notices to online gaming companies for alleged GST evasion of over Rs 1.12 lakh crore during financial years 2022-23 and 2023-24.

If the Chinese slowdown does not spread into a global contagion, India can count on bright spots like the China + 1 strategy attracting companies and investments seeking to exit China and downward pressure on commodity prices. Rate cuts in the US will increase liquidity and potentially higher FDI and FII flows into India in 2024, and Indian equity markets are definitely an attractive proposition","“Macroeconomists were created to make weather forecasters gain credibility” goes one joke. “Economists have successfully predicted 9 out of the last 5 recessions” is another dig at the predictive ability of the macroeconomics discipline. Beyond the humour, it points to the obvious complexity of interaction between hundreds of related variables in a complicated geopolitical scenario.Despite the obvious risks involved in speculating about the future in the economic domain, many brave economists undertake foolhardy tasks of making year-end projections and this is one such attempt.2023 In A NutshellPerhaps as a nod to the recession predicting joke, the global economy performed far better in 2023 than most predicted. The global economy is set to outperform the consensus forecast by nearly one percentage point, with the global GDP growth rate predicted to be in the range of 2.7 percent to 3 percent. This was led by strong growth in the United States, which outperformed consensus forecasts by nearly two percentage points, with GDP growth rate set to hit 2.4 percent.The strong GDP growth rate corresponded with lowering of unemployment rate to below pre-pandemic levels in most countries. Inflation in most countries remained stubbornly high, though it is significantly lower than the decadal highs witnessed in 2022. This is partly due to falling commodity prices in 2023. Oil prices (brent crude) decreased from about $110/barrel in mid-2022 to around $75/barrel in Dec-2023. Core inflation (minus food and oil), however, has remained sticky.In some sobering news, global trade is projected to end the year 5 percent down compared to 2022’s record level, shrinking by about $1.5 trillion to below $31 trillion, according to UNCTAD. Services, however, remained resilient and recorded 7 percent growth in 2023.India’s economic performance has been better than expected. Its GDP growth rate for the July-Sep quarter of 2023 was an impressive 7.6 percent due to both global tailwinds and increased government investment in infrastructure, which compensated for the subdued consumer spending and private sector investment. Inflation is seemingly stabilising within RBI’s comfort zone towards the end of the year after reaching mildly alarming highs in mid-2023.  Although headline inflation remained within the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) tolerance range of 2-6 percent in September and October, it has now been above the medium-term target of 4 percent for 49 consecutive months. Correspondingly, RBI has left the prime lending rate (repo rate) at 6.5 percent since April 2023.India’s trade performance has been mediocre in 2023 with widening commodity trade deficit and expected surplus in services trade. Forex reserves, after dipping sharply at the end of 2022, recovered well to reach around $598 billion. The rupee has remained flat for most of the year hovering around the Rs 82-83/$ mark, which is a significant increase from the level of Rs 78/$ seen in July 2022.Looking AheadIn 2021-22, almost everyone was convinced that the US will enter into a recessionary phase, given the aggressive monetary policy stance taken by the Federal Reserve to combat the high inflation rate. The debate was whether it would be a hard crash or a soft landing, but there was near consensus that there would be a slowdown. And when the US economy slows down, most of the world will feel its effect. However, despite many rate hikes by the Fed, the US economy remained remarkably resilient, and the job market has been incredibly robust.The expectation for global GDP growth is between 2.6 percent (Goldman Sachs) to 2.9 percent (IMF) based on the assumption of strong US-led growth. Inflation in most parts of the world is expected to be past their peak and thus, policy rates will remain stable or be reduced. The Fed has indicated about 75 bps cut in the policy rate in 2024. Not to play spoilsport, but it is important to bear in mind the significant lag in macroeconomics between the interest rate hikes by the Fed and the corresponding slowdown. The US economy could yet be affected.The Dragon In The RoomThe big development of 2024 will be the performance of the Chinese economy and the economic implications of the Israel-Hamas war. On the latter, it is expected that the war will have a negative effect on global oil prices. In the worst-case scenario of an expanded war in the middle-east, oil prices can shoot up to $140-$170/barrel, according to World Bank and that can significantly harm the global economy. However, in a more realistic baseline scenario, oil prices are expected to rise to $90/barrel before falling again.The Chinese economy has swung in the past few years, with growth ranging from 2.2 percent in 2020 to 8.4 percent in 2021 and 3 percent last year. But all of them were related to COVID and its aftermath of strict lockdowns. In 2023, China grew at 5.2 percent in the first three quarters. However, it is expected to slow down to 4.5 percent in 2024 and further to 4.1 percent in 2025, fuelled by a potential property crisis. The government will, no doubt, undertake an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy, which is factored into the projections.A prolonged Chinese slowdown is bound to harm the global economy. Many Asian countries, Australia and parts of Africa which rely on exporting raw materials to the gargantuan industrial complex of China have already started seeing decline in their export volumes. Analysis by IMF shows that when China’s growth rate rises by 1 percentage point, global expansion is boosted by about 0.3 percentage points. Thus, a contraction will have ripple effects. Strong US growth had a countervailing effect on global economic growth in 2023 to China’s downward pressure. There is no certainty that this can continue in 2024.As long as the Chinese slowdown is well contained and does not spread into a global contagion, India can afford to look at the bright spots. India’s China + 1 strategy of attracting companies seeking to exit China can get a boost. Further, a Chinese slowdown will put downward pressure on commodity prices – from oil to iron ore, which can be good for India. Fresh investments, both FDI and FII, will look at other emerging markets outside of China for investment opportunities and Indian equity markets are definitely an attractive proposition. Rate cuts in the US will only increase liquidity, which can result in higher FDI and FII flows into India in 2024.Read | India could be among fastest-growing nations in 2024-25, says FitchFor India, as long as it continues to focus on the fundamentals – building infrastructure, undertaking liberalising reforms (including trade reforms, on which we have taken two steps back in 2023),  and making it attractive for private capital, it should be in a good position to navigate through the uncertainty of 2024 and perhaps even dream to take a big step forward.Anupam Manur is a Professor of Economics at the Takshashila Institution, an independent think tank and school of public policy.

	These are also likely to be the sectors that are labour-intensive, such as textiles, food products

Another surge is expected ahead of the general elections,"Domestic institutions continued to play 'The Wall' for the Indian equity market, beating their overseas peers in buying local stocks for the third year in a row and serving as a great stabilising force whenever foreign investors went on a exodus.So far this year, the domestic institutional investors (DIIs) have net purchased around Rs 1.81 lakh crore of stocks, compared to Rs 1.66 lakh crore pumped in by foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).After withdrawing over Rs 1.27 lakh crore in 2022, the FPIs turned net buyers this year on hopes that the US Federal Reserve was done raising the rates and would start reversing soon.Over the past decade, FII inflows have surpassed those of DIIs only for three years, in sharp contrast to earlier times when foreign flows determined the trajectory of Dalal Street.The unabated DII flows stem from three sources. The first is domestic mutual funds, which are getting more than Rs 15,000 crore per month through the systematic Investment plan (SIP) route which has emerged as the top instrument for equity exposure for the average retail investor.The Indian mutual fund industry has seen a 125 percent surge in net inflows and around 24 percent growth in assets under management (AUM) since the beginning of this calendar year. The AUM of the domestic mutual fund industry has reached the historic Rs 50 lakh crore mark.Insurance companies are the second major source of DII flows. With rising awareness and insurance penetration in the country, insurance players are getting a regular flow of funds in the form of premiums, which is deployed in equities.Third, provident funds have been allowed to invest a small portion of their corpus in stocks.Read: Bulls vs Bears 2024 | Popular theories on why the rally should continue, and counterargumentsThe EPFO began investing in equities through exchange-traded funds in 2015, initially allocating 5 percent of its corpus, which has been stepped up to 15 percent. Government data shared in Parliament showed that in FY23, the EPFO invested Rs 53,081 crore in ETFs, representing over 50 percent of the total gross inflows into equity ETFs in the financial year.""DIIs are flush with the liquidity mainly because of strong inflows through mutual fund SIPs,” said Sunny Agrawal, Head of Fundamental Equity Research, SBI Securities. “Retail investors now are not panicking at times of market correction. That’s a sign of maturity and an indicator that the inflows through SIPs could remain steady.”Analysts anticipate a rise in DII buying in local equities on the back of increased awareness of equity investing that lead to greater participation from smaller towns and cities.“The fundamentals of the Indian economy remain intact which insulated the domestic economy from global shocks,” said Ashwini Kumar, head of market data at ICRA Analytics.“Continuation of the government’s reform agenda, prudent balancing of the fiscal and monetary policy, end of the global monetary policy tightening cycle and a possible interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India if inflation remains under control, will be some of the key factors driving higher inflows into the mutual fund industry in 2024,” he said.Read: Investors should seriously tone down their expectations for 2024: Radhika GuptaThe year 2023 saw mixed trends in FII investments. They sold in September and October due to factors like rising US treasury bond yields, geopolitical concerns, and Sebi's revised FPI guidelines effective from November 1. These rules demand detailed ownership information for FPIs with over 50 percent Indian assets in a single group or over Rs 25,000 crore in Indian equity.However, the analysts do not foresee these rules limiting FII buying in Indian markets, given that the economy is among the best placed across emerging and developed markets.The analysts foresee further rise in Indian markets in the first half of 2024 on the back of likely rate cuts by global central banks as well as the RBI. Another surge is expected ahead of the general elections.""This makes the emerging market more attractive for investments.

The inflation rate on pulses was recorded at 20 percent in November, according to data available from the Statistics Ministry.High food inflation has been a key concern for the government, as the general elections draw close. The Centre has already extended its free grain distribution programme, PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, by five years to 2028, providing 5 kg of grains monthly to impoverished households.Additionally, it has taken various administrative steps to stabilize the prices of essential items like sugar, rice, pulses, vegetables & edible oils.Tur prices have remained high in the past year due to a shortfall in domestic production. However, the government’s measures have started taking effect, and prices of tur fell to Rs 154 per kg on December 18 from Rs 156.5 a month ago.The government on December 8 also exempted yellow peas (tur) from import duties until the end of this financial year, removing minimum import prices and port restrictions to facilitate trade.Anticipating a shortfall in the current year due to erratic weather, the Centre in January extended the duty-free import policy for tur & urad until March 31, 2024.Additionally, the government on June 2 allowed traders to keep only limited stocks of tur and urad. Following this step, the government released tur from the national buffer stocks to arrest the price rise.The government launched chana dal under the packaging of ‘Bharat Dal’ at subsidized prices of Rs 60 per kg throughout the country, intending to shift consumption for those who cannot afford expensive arhar or tur dal.The centre has also started procuring tur dal directly from farmers at market prices to build a buffer stock that will be offloaded in the market when prices rise. Funds for the procurement are being taken from the Price Stabilisation Fund.High consumptionTur consumption has been higher than domestic production. The country's tur output fell 20 percent to 3.43 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July–June) from 4.29 million tonnes a year earlier. The country consumes about 4.5 million tonnes of tur every year.The agriculture ministry’s first advance estimates for the crop season 2023-24 put tur production slightly lower at 3.42 million tonnes.As per government data, India imported about 778,000 tonnes of tur in calendar year 2023 from Mozambique, Myanmar and Tanzania.Also Read: How the government launched its own Bharat brands to keep food grain prices under control"

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. The year 2023 is set to close on a euphoric note for equity investors in India. Year-till-date, the MSCI India has returned about 19 per cent in USD terms, reflecting the investor’s conviction in uninterrupted economic recovery post-pandemic and robust economic growth.But are stock markets truly representative of economic growth? A look at equity market returns across several other emerging markets (EM) are thought-provoking. The MSCI country-wise year-till-date 2023 (as of 27th December) data shows that Poland, Hungary and Greece topped the list, with returns of 48 per cent, 46 per cent and 45 per cent respectively in USD terms. Even equities in Brazil and Peru fared better than India!Does this mean that the economies of all these countries are growing at breakneck speed? Not really. Perhaps, it is the relative growth or an improvement in growth that is being mirrored in equity markets. For instance, Brazil’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth, albeit lower than some of its peers, is forecast to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2023, which is an improvement from negative growth rates seen even in pre-pandemic years. Growth in Hungary too is expected to pick up in 2024.Again, while the travails of the US and the UK economies are grabbing headlines and the poor fiscal health of the Eurozone is also widely known, stock markets seem to be in the pink of health.What can be said with certainty is that investors are betting on equities as an asset class to beat inflation that has reigned high for long. Within this, emerging markets hold greater promise for returns, on the back of higher consumption potential that could seep into corporates, translating into revenue and profit growth. Further, signals of a rate pivot by US Fed have taken the sheen off bonds, which may drive more flows into equities.Another reason could be valuations. Indian equities, in spite of the rally, are trading at around the average one-year forward price-to-earnings multiples. Given the estimated earnings expansion, it appears like the rally in equities would sustain.Finally, it is all about investor sentiment that is currently favouring Indian equities. A recent Bank of America Fund Manager Survey (FMS) shows that over the next 12-month horizon, investors are overweight on India, besides Japan, Taiwan and Korea. This also correlates with the sectors such as IT and manufacturing that have a fair share of listed companies.On another front, investors are fleeing from China’s equities. This is in spite of positive economic data, signs of a thaw in US-China relations and efforts by the government to support slowing growth by cutting rates. Almost 90 per cent of funds that flowed into Chinese stocks in 2023 have left amid concern about economy, says this FT article (available only for MCPro subscribers).That said, in a country as large as India, equity market capitalisation and listed corporate profits are barely representative of the economy’s overall health. This is why observations of a K-shaped recovery, high inflation and interest rates and rural recovery along with global geopolitical events are still considered risk factors to sustained economic growth by analysts.Investing insightsAmi Organics: Multiple growth catalyst taking shapeFiem's growth driven by LED adoption and EV expansionWhat are we reading?Will CESC’s pivot towards green energy resolve its valuation woes? Start-up Street: Will 2024 see more Dragons take wing?RBI warns on growing bank-NBFC linkage, pushes for greater governanceShould a central bank let its emotions show?From G20 to Chandrayaan-3, Article 370 to Ram Mandir, BJP well set for the 2024 grand finalePersonal FinanceBeating the market rollercoaster with longer term investmentsTechnical picks: Maruti, Bajaj Finance, Macrotech Developers,  Coriander,and GoldBees (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app). Vatsala KamatMoneycontrol Pro"

Factors such as raw material prices and the high cost of logistics are becoming an additional burden for Indian exporters in the face of this global trade depression. We urge the government to look into these matters and continue supporting us to keep us competitive in the global market"".The share of engineering exports in India's total merchandise exports was recorded at 23.17 per cent in November 2023, as against 24.11 per cent in the preceding month, EEPC said.Among top exporting destinations, exports to Saudi Arabia, Russia, South Korea, Mexico, Singapore, UAE, and Brazil experienced year-on-year growth in November 2023, while shipments to the USA, UK, Germany, Italy, and China saw negative export growth, the trade body said.Notably, since the signing of the FTA with Australia, engineering exports to the country declined for the first time in November this year."

Apart from the extension of PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), MSP is going up, which is another increase. Wheat and rice prices are going up, so automatically there will be an increase in MSP and recovery is zero,” the official told Moneycontrol.“The fiscal consolidation path of 4.5 percent by FY26 remains the government’s commitment, we will see how to get there in the Union Budget,” he added.The Union Cabinet on November 29, 2023, approved an extension of the free foodgrain scheme to around 81 crore poor people for five more years until December 2028. The extension will cost the exchequer around Rs 11.8 lakh crore during the period. In FY23, the food subsidy is estimated at Rs 2.04 lakh crore.The FY25 Budget is likely to see 40 to 50 percent more allocation for LPG subsidy. The FY24 LPG subsidy budget was at Rs 2,257 crore with an estimated Rs 9,200 crore additional allocation. The additional funds will be utilised for the Rs 300 per cylinder Ujwala Subsidy and for providing free LPG connections. Higher LPG subsidy and sales are also likely to see increased allocation in the FY25 Budget.“The full-year expenditure impact of PMGKAY will be felt in the next fiscal. The Rs 300 per cylinder LPG subsidy expenditure impact will also be for the full year in FY25. New home loan interest subvention scheme will also be there next year for which the government is estimating a Rs 60,000 crore expenditure burden in five years,” he said.The Centre will provide subsidised loans under the new home subvention scheme over the next five years. During his Independence Day speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the scheme for middle-class families residing in rented accommodation, chawls or tenements and illegal colonies in cities.The government’s fertiliser subsidy in FY24 is now pegged at around Rs 1.88 lakh crore. Globally if the prices of urea, other fertilisers, and natural gas remain volatile going into the next year the high subsidy is likely to be extended well into FY25. The government may have to look at an elevated fertiliser subsidy expenditure next year as well.Impact on India’s credit ratingsA sharp cut in fiscal deficit in FY25 by India is likely to impact its credit rating positively. According to S&P Global Ratings, India needs to lower its fiscal deficit ""a lot more"" if it wants to get an upgrade.""Unless we see significantly more fiscal consolidation and bringing deficits down a lot more than what we have seen recently, we are unlikely to see further upside pressures on the rating,"" Kim Eng Tan, S&P managing director for APAC sovereign ratings, said on December 14, 2023.A faster-than-targeted fall in the fiscal deficit will send a ""very good signal"", Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee member Ashima Goyal told Moneycontrol on December 26.""Steady reduction in government debt to East Asian levels will improve Indian ratings, reduce risk premiums and the cost of borrowing abroad,"" she said.Meeting FY24 fiscal targetThis year’s fiscal deficit target of 5.9 percent will be easily met despite the additional expenditures on high growth in revenue.“Despite additional expenditures, as a percentage the government will meet the fiscal deficit target in FY24. There will be no deviation as this year we will manage to achieve it as oil prices are manageable. The additional expenditure impact in FY24 has been for a few months,” the official said.Expert SpeakGoing by the recent trends in both tax and non-tax revenues, the government is well in line to achieve the current year's target.“With every projection suggesting a higher GDP growth prospects for India until 2028, it appears to be feasible to achieve a 4.5 percent fiscal deficit by FY2026.However, there could be some risks in the next two years. Forthcoming general elections and global economic and political disturbances might push pressure on the fisc,” N R Bhanumurthy, vice-chancellor of Dr B R Ambedkar School of Economics University, Bengaluru, told Moneycontrol.India Ratings has said that they expect the FY24 fiscal deficit to be at 6 percent mainly due to lower nominal GDP growth compared to the budget assumption.ALSO READ: Higher spends on MGNREGA, subsidies to lead to some fiscal slippage in FY24: India Ratings“Even from 5.9 percent in FY24, the fiscal deficit in two years has to be consolidated by 1.4 percentage points. Based on the experience of four decades, there have been four instances of achieving fiscal consolidation of more than 1.4 percentage points over a two-year period without fiscal expansion two years earlier. The task is difficult but can be achieved. Three important factors to achieve are sustained economic growth, revenue buoyancy and expenditure rationalisation,” Devendra Kumar Pant, Chief Economist, India Ratings, told Moneycontrol.If we look at the data, India was on the fiscal consolidation path till 2019-20 at 4.6 percent, but pandemic pushed it to 9.2 percent in 2020-21.“Post the pandemic period, the economic recovery is encouraging and the tax revenues have been buoyant. The only issue with the revenue projections is the disinvestment targets is too optimistic when the domestic and global economy is in a recovery cycle. On the expenditure side, the government’s went on a counter-cyclical investment spending path, the returns will be realised only in the medium to long run. The interest payments are huge worrisome factor, which have increased from Rs 8,05,499 crore in 2021-22 to Rs 10,79,971 crore in 2023-24. The government should focus on restricting of debt in such a way to reduce interest burden,” National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) economist Sri Hari Nayudu told Moneycontrol.As far as the dividends from RBI and other public sector undertakings is concerned, the government in 2023-24 will be able to exceed the targeted Rs 91,000 crore.“Given the scenario, expenditure rationalisation measures are the need of the hour to achieve fiscal consolidation path. This does not mean expenditure reduction. The government should review all the schemes and also administrative expenditures on different schemes to rationalise the schemes,” Nayudu added."

In November, it stood at 8.7 per cent.Agricultural crops are grown in two seasons -- kharif (summer) and rabi (winter) -- between July 2023 and June 2024. Kharif crops have been harvested while rabi crops are sown now.The agriculture ministry has come out with its initial estimates which do not give a positive picture due to the projection of a likely slight drop in the 2023 kharif food grain output at 148.56 million tonnes as against 155.7 million tonnes in the year-ago period due to ""below average"" rainfall in the four-month (June-September) monsoon season amid strengthening of El Nino conditions.Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh faced drought conditions while Tamil Nadu faced floods due to cyclone Michaung, impacting kharif crops and farmers' livelihoods.The ministry's first estimate showed that the 2023 kharif production of rice, maize, moong, oilseeds, sugarcane and cotton was lower than the year-ago period. The estimate for rabi crops output is yet to come.However, ministry officials are of the view that the kharif food grain production estimates will be revised positively by the time the fourth and final estimates are prepared.""Climate change is a reality today. However, our agri sector has shown resilience to extreme weather events. The government is promoting climate-resilient seeds. With these measures, we are hopeful of achieving a bountiful harvest in 2023-24,"" Agriculture Secretary Manoj Ahuja told PTI.Drought and flood-tolerant seeds were promoted during the kharif season while in the ongoing rabi season, heat-resistance varieties have been sown in more than 60 per cent area, he added.The secretary, however, mentioned that the slightly lower kharif food grain output projected for this year is not a cause for concern.Last year too, the country faced erratic weather conditions and yet could achieve a record food grain production of 329.68 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June) as per the ministry's final estimates.However, a sudden temperature rise sparked concern about last year's wheat output leading to an export ban in May 2022 to check high domestic prices.When the final estimates were released, the wheat output was pegged at a record 110.55 million tonnes for 2022-23 compared to 107.7 million tonnes achieved in the previous year but slightly lower than the third estimate.Asserting that wheat sowing is progressing well this year, Agriculture Commissioner P K Singh said, ""we have further increased the wheat area under climate resilient seeds which should help face terminal heat.""Area sown to wheat has reached 30.86 million hectares till December 22, marginally lower than 31.4 million hectares in the year-ago period, because of the delay in paddy harvesting, he said.The government has started issuing weekly advisories to farmers to prepare them to face the adverse weather conditions, he added.India is the world's second-largest producer of wheat and rice, the two commodities which the government buys directly from farmers to ensure them at least a Minimum Support Price (MSP), maintain a buffer stock for implementation of welfare schemes and use it for market intervention to control retail inflation.In the year ahead of the 2024 general elections, the government walked a tightrope to balance farmers' and consumer interests. To woo farmers, paddy MSP was hiked by Rs 143 to Rs 2,183 per quintal for this year, the second steepest increase in the last decade. The highest increase in the paddy MSP in the last 10 years was by Rs 200 per quintal in 2018-19.Similarly, wheat MSP was raised by Rs 150 to Rs 2,275 per quintal for the 2023-24 crop year, which in fact was the highest increase by the Narendra Modi-led government since it came to power in 2014.The MSP of pulses and oilseeds were also raised keeping in mind the need to become self reliant and reduce dependency on imports. The government also did not leave any stone unturned to promote the production and promotion of millets in the international year of millets.Not only wheat and paddy growers but even farmers growing horticultural crops like tomato and onion faced weather-induced challenges.Unseasonal rainfall led to damage of the crop in some states, creating a supply crunch and pushing up retail prices up to Rs 200 per kilogramme in July in most parts of the country and the government for the first time had to procure tomato and retail at subsidised rates. As a result, now, retail tomato prices are ruling stable at Rs 30 per kg in Delhi.In the case of onion too, the government was on guard and began the sale of buffer onions at subsidised rates in cities where prices had shot up sharply in the last few months. As prices showed significant movement last month, the government banned exports till March next year to improve domestic availability.The government prioritised balancing the interests of farmers and consumers while continuing to support the farming community through different schemes like PM-KISAN, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), and Kisan Credit Card.The government also extended the free distribution of ration to 81 crore poor under the public distribution system for the next five years."

And when the prices did cool off a bit, it reminded all about the target to get the headline consumer price inflation at 4 per cent and the risks from food inflation.Heading into the new year, all eyes are on when RBI will cut the rates, especially after one of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members stressed on the need for such an action in the face of the US Federal Reserve's guidance for easing rates. Also, some analysts point to the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) falling below the 4 per cent mark in mid-2024 and then, there will be prospects of a rate cut.RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, who is into the last year of his second three-year term at the helm of the central bank, has been steadfast in highlighting the need to get the inflation down to 4 per cent on a durable basis.CPI cooled off to a four-month low of 4.87 per cent in October but rose to 5.55 per cent in November. After announcing the December monetary policy review, Das said that ""loosening in rates is not on the table at all"" till the inflation demon is chained at or is under 4 per cent for a durable time.In December, he said the future is ""very fickle"", where any shock can hit the economy.The policy stance has continued to be ""withdrawal of accommodation"" through the year and will be relooked only when inflation reaches the target zone for a ""durable time"", Das had said.Episodic rise in inflation like the one fuelled by sky-high tomato and onions prices in the latter half of the year has made the central bank's warnings on potential troubles from food inflation feel more real.The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has the mandate to keep inflation at 4 per cent, with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.Post general elections, the central bank will be keenly watching the actions of the new government to decide on its policy rate and liquidity strategies.Into his sixth year as the Governor, Das had taken over the reins at a tumultuous time for the institution on December 11, 2018 after the surprise resignation of his predecessor Urjit Patel and then navigating through the pandemic mayhem.Das has been feted the world over for his leadership and he was also chosen for the best central banker award this year.With the bureaucrat-turned-central banker at the helm, relations between the Mint Road and North Block has been cordial, barring his continued opposition on crypto currencies.Das has also flagged risks in the financial system and kicked off a series of addresses from May 2023 to bank boards and their managements. He had told them that the central bank's periodic inspections have revealed lapses in corporate governance, smart accounting practices to inflate profits and also attempts at evergreening of loans.The mid-December notification prohibiting banks to lend to an entity that has bets in an Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) is seen by many as a fallout of such concerns.After warning about potential risk build-up on the unsecured loans front, the central bank has followed it up with a notification to massively jack up the risk weights on unsecured loans in November, rattling the credit market and more so non-bank lenders which have been underwriting such loans.To clip the wings of large corporates which bargain for cheaper loans for their lower-rated connected entities, the regulator said it will soon introduce curbs on such lending.The central bank ensured that the mega-merger of the HDFC twins happened smoothly.Apart from the entrenched entities, the challenge from new age entities indulging in lending activities continued in 2023. Such activities are expected to grow bigger as newer attempts continue at disrupting the game, according to experts.The central bank's policies over the years have come in for a lot of praise as the government propped the digital payments architecture through the year, and also made it into a key theme during the G20 presidency.In the new year, the RBI will also focus on promoting the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) so that it reaches a critical mass in terms of volume."

According to Bloomberg data, the BSE Sensex is trading at 20.56 times its one-year blended forward earnings while its 10-year average stands at 18.11 times. The Nifty50 index is trading at 20.11 times its one-year forward earnings and its 10-year average of 17.5 times.Since 2002, the Sensex and the Nifty have experienced annual declines only three times in 2008, 2011, and in 2015. Otherwise, they have ended higher in every other year during this period.On the face of it, things appear to be in favour of bulls in 2024 as well. Many see the BJP’s massive win in the recent state elections as a precursor to a convincing victory in May 2024 general elections as well. That augurs well for the continuity of government policy.In addition, the Fed has signalled that it will cut the benchmark interest rates in 2024, and many market participants see that happening as early as in March. Should Fed cut rates, it would prompt a similar move from the RBI as well. Economists say the reason the RBI has not cut the rates so far is that doing it ahead of a similar decision by the Fed could put pressure on the rupee.But some market experts say investors would be better off partially booking profits in stocks, particularly smallcaps and midcaps, where they have made outsized gains.Read: Zomato trades lower on Rs 402-crore show-cause notice for GST dues""The year 2024 will be interesting as developed economies are likely to slow down, but challenges of rate hikes are unlikely.

The INDIA alliance looks woefully ill-prepared to convince voters that they have a better alternative to offer","2023, the year gone by, in a sense belonged to the BJP-led government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi despite a few lows. As the country braces to face the Lok Sabha polls in April-May 2024, the prelude that was this year unpacked enough issues – which BJP counts as the government’s stellar achievements – to fill a good portion of the platter it will offer voters.Modi All The WayThe year-long presidency of the G20 countries unleashed a blitzkrieg of publicity and propaganda to talk up India’s growing global status; the country’s ascendancy to being the world’s fifth largest economic power after the US, China, Japan and Germany—that left India with the vicarious pleasure of outpacing a former coloniser, the UK; the refusal to yield to Western pressure while condemning Russia’s war on Ukraine which President Vladimir Putin used to cock a snook at the US and its allies; the increased oil imports from Russia at a reduced price and India’s pitch to listen to the unheard voices of the Global South to ensure inclusive growth amid economic worries, all these factors enhanced BJP’s exercise to project Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “vishwa guru”.The stand-out in this spectrum of global outreach was soaring into galactic space with the moon landing via the Chandrayaan-3 Mission on August 23. India was only the fourth country after the US, erstwhile Soviet Union and China to achieve a soft landing in the lunar south pole. There was more.A week after the landing, on September 2, India touched another milestone with the launch of its maiden observation mission, Aditya-L1, destined for the sun from the ISRO space centre at Sriharikota. Such triumphs served as catalysts for fuelling the ambitions and aspirations of burgeoning space start-ups.The Centre’s decisions to read down Article 370 which conferred special rights on Jammu and Kashmir and reset the region’s territorial boundaries were ratified by the Supreme Court that settled the debate on whether the moves were constitutional or not.BJP Ends Year On A High2023 was a mixed bag for political parties seeking to test the electoral waters. BJP suffered a reversal in Karnataka, which helped Congress get a boost in the south, and the outcome had a ripple effect on neighbouring Telangana where Congress came from behind to stun both BRS and BJP.In politics a party is as effective or ineffective as the last election won or lost. Congress was wiped out in the elections in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Mizoram as BJP emerged victorious in the first three states, marking its near-hegemonic hold over the Hindi belt.What Does 2024 Portend?Clearly, BJP enters the Lok Sabha battle with a head start over the Opposition. The heartland victories boosted the party and the government’s preparations. The focal point is the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra which serves as the main conduit for disseminating and propagating the Centre’s flagship social schemes the country over. The target audiences are the beneficiaries of the welfare programmes and those living below the poverty line in step with the BJP’s effort to sustain its image as a socially and economically inclusive entity.The Ram temple’s consecration at Ayodhya on January 22 by PM Modi, in the presence of a large gathering mobilised by the RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad (the original spearhead of the temple agitation) and Bajrang Dal, is expected to form the nucleus of the campaign directed at the “parivar’s” core constituency as well as an enlarged following of the neo-converts to Hindutva. The temple “movement” to reclaim the “original” site which, the VHP alleged, was appropriated by the Mughals to raise the Babri mosque on the debris of a Ram mandir, marked BJP’s national ascendancy to power and is counted among the country’s impactful mass “crusades”.With the temple, the “Hindutva-nationalism” package will include the legally-upheld “breakthroughs” to “integrate” Kashmir with mainstream India and the promise to introduce a common civil code if elected to power. It isn’t as though there are no challenges staring BJP in the face. It has to work doubly hard to retain the maximum gains it notched in the heartland and the west in 2019. Barring the north-east and Assam in the main, Odisha and West Bengal do not offer much scope for augmenting seats while the south remains a daunting terrain except for Karnataka and possibly Telangana.The Opposition bloc of INDIA constituents began on a promising note in 2023 as a front united to take on BJP in 2024. But soon, the contradictions, which appear irreconcilable at times, surfaced over seat-sharing and a common agenda, not to speak of leadership. A vastly weakened Congress cannot afford to dominate the coalition that includes powerful regional forces such as Trinamool Congress Party and DMK. Besides, the INDIA bloc lacks the heft that parties such as BJD, YSRCP and BRS could have brought to the alliance.  The policy of maintaining equidistance from Congress and BJP – that in effect implies greater proximity to BJP – precluded their inclusion in the INDIA alliance.Radhika Ramaseshan is a senior journalist and columnist.

According to the scheme, 813.5 million Indian ration card holders could purchase 10 kg of wheat and rice at subsidised rates of Rs 3 and Rs 2, respectively. The scheme was then revised to provide for 5 kg of rice and wheat at the same prices from January 2023 onwards.As inflation rose, the government has taken a slew of steps to curb the worrying trend of rising food prices, including the rollout of its own price-controlled ‘Bharat’ brand of cereals.The launch of Bharat cereal brandBharat Dal: On July 18, 2023, Union Food Minister Piyush Goyal launched the sale of 'subsidised' chana dal under the brand name ‘Bharat Dal'. This was the first of the Bharat brands to be brought to the market. It was priced at Rs 60 per kg, 18 percent lower than the market price of the lentil at Rs 74.5 per kg. Chana dal prices have risen 14.5 percent in the past year, as per data provided by the department of consumer affairs.The Centre’s move to launch chana dal at ‘subsidised’ rates came at a time when retail prices of tur (arhar) had risen sharply, with the all-India daily average retail price of tur being recorded at Rs 134.48 per kg on July 18, almost 33 percent higher than a year ago. The retail prices of urad and moong were also 10-11 percent higher compared to their levels a year before.Bharat Atta: Fortified wheat flour, made with a blend of rice, wheat, and pulses, was launched on November 6, 2023, for sale across the country before the beginning of the festival season. This was aimed at controlling the prices of wheat flour, which have been on the rise. Bharat Atta, priced at Rs 27.5 per kg, is being made available across the country at price-sensitive points via 700 mobile vans and 2,000 government-operated outlets.The retail price of wheat flour at the launch of Bharat Atta had stood at Rs 36 per kg in the country, up 5.6 percent on-year, according to data collected by the Department of Consumer Affairs.A total of 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat had been allocated to central government agencies, including NCCF (National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India Limited) and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed) at Rs 21.5 per kg, that are turning this into atta and selling it at Rs 27.5 per kg. The quantity of wheat allocated under the scheme has been enhanced further to four lakh metric tonnes, in December.Also Read: Govt to offload 7 lakh tonne onions by late February to bring down prices to Rs 35 a kiloHave the measures helped?Despite the launch of subsidised cereals, prices of both pulses and wheat flour have not come down significantly.As of December 27, prices of tur stood at Rs 153.02 per kg, up from Rs 134.5 per kg during the launch of Bharat Dal. However, they were down 3 percent month-on-month from Rs 157.78 as of November 27.“On pulses and wheat, we have arrested the trend of increase, which is significant as prices have started plateauing. Green shoots are visible in tur where prices have started coming down. We aim to bring down tur prices to under Rs 130 per kg by February 2024,” Consumer Affairs Secretary Rohit Singh had told Moneycontrol in a recent interaction.Prices of wheat flour have remained stable, ruling at Rs 36 per kg as of December 27, with no change since the launch of Bharat Atta.“The sale price of Bharat Atta and Dal being below the MRP is expected to attract significant consumer interest and is playing a role in keeping inflation stable, if not reducing it. But the true effectiveness of Bharat Rice/Dal/Atta in controlling inflation will depend on its widespread availability, posing a substantial logistical challenge that the government must address,” Anand Chandra, co-founder at agri start-up Arya.ag, which operates more than 3,000 storage warehouses for rice and wheat across the country, said.However, as per a senior government official, it is the trend of rising prices of food items that the ministry has been able to arrest at the right time, making the intervention fruitful. “Prices of chana dal have come down from Rs 83.35 per kg last month to Rs 79.85 per kg this month. Similarly, for wheat flour, prices have remained stable, which would have risen very high had we not intervened,” the official explained.Also read: Government hopes to reduce tur prices to Rs 130/kg by FebruaryLaunch of Bharat Rice on cards?After Bharat Atta and Bharat Dal, the Centre, as per government sources, is now planning to sell Bharat Rice at discounted rates to contain the rising prices of the cereal that have refused to come down.The decision comes amidst a significant surge in the all-India average retail price of rice, reaching Rs 43.3 per kg, reflecting a 14.1 percent increase from the previous year.Also Read: Food On Fire| How has the government tackled the inflation inferno"

Hopefully, by 2025, we should start looking up. The geopolitical scenario should resolve itself. The second thing on IT services is the entry of AI. Most companies have done the work, they are building that into their offerings but all customers are not yet ready. There is a lot of talk, a lot of buzz. Accenture was very quick off the block with AI but their results were not great,” Saurabh Srivastava, co-founder, Indian Angel Network, a platform for seed and early-stage investing, told Moneycontrol.The ongoing geopolitical situation is squeezing budgets, he added. “We have seen this before. Generally, I find that Indian IT services companies pick up before their global counterparts because they have more reserves. Most IT companies are very healthy on their balance sheets.”Layoffs in tech and where are the jobs?According to reports, the tech sector overall has witnessed huge layoffs, affecting around two lakh people in 2023. Some of the reasons cited for that are economic slowdown and widespread adoption of AI.Srivastava said that while the IT sector could look at cost management, Indian IT does not resort to massive layoffs and are generally more mindful of cost as compared to their European counterparts.“When slowdown ends.. they are ready to take the upside. They don’t have to get ready to take advantage of the winds.”In terms of job creation, Srivastava said that one measure to see among IT services companies is their revenue per employee. “And for a long time, it has become less and less linear. Companies are building tools, platforms, products, there is a lot of re-skilling happening.”On the debate on whether AI will take away jobs or generate jobs, he said that one needs to take a wider view. “It wasn’t long ago that the government believed that automation would lead to fewer jobs... there were similar fears during the industrial revolution. History will tell you it’s a fear that has never been realised. You will have more jobs but different jobs.”“The Indian IT industry will keep hiring but how much it hires that rate might go down –as revenue per employee goes up, more efficiency comes in, that will happen. But there is a need for all those people in tech start-ups. Every start-up is tech driven, so they need tech people. In the end, a start-up ecosystem will create more jobs than just one IT major.”You can watch the full conversation with Saurabh Srivastava here."

498,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-rising-passive-investment-11959901.html,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | Rising passive investment,"December 27, 2023 05:57 PM IST","In this edition of Moneycontrol Pro Panorama: High food inflation can play spoilsport, services pull up current account in latest quarter, decline in bond yields an opportunity for investors, 2023 a mega year for SME IPOs, and more","Dear Reader, Indian markets are gradually attracting the attention of global investors. While domestic investments have shown resilience since the pandemic, foreign investors influence short-term market trends.The extent of Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) involvement in India depends upon the performance of their markets and interest rates. Foreign investors tend to withdraw funds from emerging markets when interest rates are high. Conversely, investors channel funds into emerging markets in a risk-off scenario with falling interest rates and buoyant equity markets.The pattern of FII investments in India has been anything but consistent. The fiscal year 2020-21 peaked as FIIs infused Rs 2,74,031.96 crore post-pandemic, capitalising on excess funds released through quantitative easing. However, the subsequent two years witnessed withdrawals amounting to Rs 1,40,009 crore in 2021-22 and Rs 37,631 crore in 2022-23, coinciding with a rise in interest rates. As interest rates reach their zenith and the Indian economy gains traction while China experiences a slowdown, FIIs have injected Rs 1,87,920 crore into India in the current fiscal year, 2023-24.A significant portion of the investments flowing into the country emanates from passive funds. Asset management companies prefer the cost-effective index fund route over maintaining a comprehensive asset management team for investment oversight. Consequently, increasing passive funds tracking India augurs well for higher investments, particularly from nations with a substantial equity investment culture.In a recent communication, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) reported the launch of seven passive funds tracking Nifty indices in Japan and South Korea. Six funds follow the Nifty50 index, while one focuses on a Nifty50 2x leverage index. The exchange anticipates an incremental inflow of $550 million into the country through this channel.Presently, 21 passive funds track Nifty indices outside India. Notable Asset Management Companies (AMCs) tracking the Indian index include iShares Blackrock, DWS, First Trust, Nomura AMC, and Mirae Asset Global Investments. Additionally, some funds track alternative indices, such as the MSCI index.The popularity of passive funds extends beyond foreign investors, finding favour among domestic investors as well. In India, 270 passive funds are tracking various Nifty indices. The total Assets Under Management (AUM) of passive funds in India and abroad have surged to approximately $70 billion as of November 2023, compared to $1 billion in November 2013, reflecting an impressive annualised growth rate of 53 percent.Recognising the role of passive funds in attracting foreign capital, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken steps to ease regulations. This includes reducing the capital requirement for passive-only fund houses to Rs 10 crore from the current Rs 50 crore and prescribing liberal disclosure rules for such fund houses.As the Indian economy, companies and markets continue to outperform, the more will its attraction for foreign investors increase and the more funds will track Indian indices.Investing InsightsKaynes Technology: Is it the right time to choose this EMS business?Cantabil Retail India: Growth set to gain momentum TrackerPro Economic Tracker | India's economy shows stronger signsWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge | Silent wait for HDFC Bank re-rating, BSE craves for NSE public issue, Polycab promoters pitch tentResilient services buoy current account in September quarterExpected decline in bond yields creates an opportunity for investorsHigh food inflation can upset the applecartSEBI's shortening of the settlement cycle will take a toll on the marketChart of the Day: 2023 a year to remember for SME IPOsWill lower incentives play spoilsport for Ola Electric’s IPO?Big Tech outspends venture capital firms in AI investment frenzy (republished from the FT)Technology: Not just 2023, 2024 will also be about AI’s rapid stridesPersonal FinanceThis debt fund is a winner, and not just when interest rates start to fall.

While BFSI (Banking, Financial Services and Insurance) sector got 47.6 per cent less this year, funding in manufacturing went down by 43 per cent, while in engineering & construction lowered by 64 per cent.Also, shipping & logistics witnessed a fall of 60.6 per cent, inflow in education lowered by 78.4 per cent.

These protocols will be different for different fruits and vegetables.The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), along with other stakeholders, has developed these protocols for bananas. APEDA is an arm of the commerce ministry.""With the successful trial shipment, India aims to export bananas worth over USD one billion in the next five years, opening doors to a diversified market portfolio through sea route,"" the official said.The trial shipment reached Rotterdam, Netherlands on December 5. The consignment was shipped from Baramati, Maharashtra.India's banana export destinations extend beyond the Middle East, with potential opportunities in major global players like the USA, Russia, Japan, Germany, China, the Netherlands, the UK, and France, the official added.Despite being the world's largest banana producer, India's export share is currently just one per cent in the global market, even though the country accounts for 26.45 per cent of the world's banana production at 35.36 million metric tonnes.In 2022-23, India exported bananas worth USD 176 million, equivalent to 0.36 MMT.The main banana producing states include Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.Assistant Professor and expert on agri economics Chirala Shankar Rao said that huge export potential for bananas is there from Andhra Pradesh.APEDA's continuous efforts, including B2B exhibitions and the development of sea protocols for other fruits, highlight a proactive approach to boost India's agricultural exports, the official added."

Ultimately, banking does well when the economy does well. RBI recently revised India's growth projection from 6.5 per cent to 7 per cent,"" Kotak Mahindra Bank Whole Time Director Shanti Ekambaram told PTI.Growth seems to be robust. Credit demand started some 18 months ago with retail segment and it is now moving to capex, she added.On the flip side, she said that deposit growth has been slower than credit growth and that's the challenge that the banks have to address in the coming months.Although there is some increase in the deposit growth, there is still a significant gap of about 500 basis points when compared to loan growth.Aggregate deposits with banks increased 12.2 per cent during the 2023 April-November period as against 9.3 per cent a year ago.Credit growth moderated to 16.4 per cent as on December 1, 2023 from 17.5 per cent a year ago, as per the latest RBI Bulletin.Slower deposit mobilisation would result in a decline in Current Account and Savings Account (CASA) limiting room for rate reduction.As indicated by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das in October, interest rate would remain high for some time.RBI is unlikely to cut policy rate at least for next six months, as per analysts.The demand for housing, car, education and personal loans would continue to witness a double-digit growth. However, there is a moderation in credit demand from the rural segment which is reflected in the decline in two wheeler and tractor sales.Even the Net Interest Margin (NIM) is expected to remain at over 3 per cent for most of the banks due to the elevated level of interest rate.A key positive factor for the banking sector is the decline in Non Performing Assets (NPAs) to a comfortable level and fresh slippages are also under control. It provides banks room to expand their balance sheets with focus on capital.NPAs declined as a result of the government's 4Rs strategy of Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reforms, analysts said.According to RBI data, Gross NPAs or GNPAs of the Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) have declined in the last three years.It declined from Rs 8,35,051 crore (GNPA ratio of 7.33 per cent) as on March 31, 2021 to Rs 7,42,397 crore (GNPA ratio of 5.82 per cent) as on March 31, 2022. Further, the amount dropped to Rs 5,71,544 crore (GNPA ratio of 3.87 per cent) as on March 31, 2023.Similarly, these banks' GNPAs pertaining to corporates declined from Rs 5,15,150 crore as on March 31, 2021 to Rs 4,33,749 crore as on March 31, 2022. It stood at Rs 2,75,298 crore as on March 31, 2023.The robust performance of the banks in the first half of the current fiscal has been ably supported by a well-capitalised banking system that witnessed an upswing in credit disbursement to the retail, industry and services segments, according to the analysts.A major development in the banking sector this year was Uday Kotak's decision to step down as the MD and CEO of Kotak Mahindra Bank after steering the lender for almost two decades since its incorporation.His successor Ashok Vaswani will assume charge next year.While the financials of the banking system improved, there were instances of fraud. UCO Bank and Bank of Baroda witnessed cyber frauds.Against this backdrop, the finance ministry held a meeting in November with all stakeholders to discuss issues related to cyber security in the financial services sector and increasing incidents of recent online financial frauds.The meeting took stock of the preparedness of the banks and other financial institutions in tackling the challenges arising from cyber security in the financial services sector and the need for a focused approach to mitigate cyber attacks and frauds."

But the involvement of money does not change the nature of the game. If one plays chess with money, chess does not become gambling but remains a game of skill. This is the argument the gaming companies will present in courts,” one of the persons told Moneycontrol.Online gaming companies have been sent 71 show-cause notices for alleged GST evasion worth Rs 1.12 lakh crore in 2022-23, and in the first seven months of 2023-24. The notices are based on the interpretation that any online game played with money is betting, which has always been taxed at 28 percent.Online gaming firms are in a tussle over the payment of 28 percent GST, instead of 18 percent, for the period up to October 1, 2023. Before October 1, 2023, betting was taxed 28 percent while online gaming was taxed at 18 percent GST rates.In the case of Gameskraft, the Supreme Court had, on September 6, 2023, stayed the Karnataka High Court's judgment, which quashed a GST notice against the Bengaluru-based online gaming company for alleged evasion of Rs 21,000 crore.Dream Sports, the parent company of Dream11 (Sporta Technologies Private Limited), had filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court in September 2023, challenging a GST show-cause notice.

The ruling DMK, which is set to organise its maiden Global Investors Meet (GIM), has been seeking investments from overseas investors through visits to Japan, Singapore and Dubai.In an interview to PTI, Tamil Nadu Industries Minister T R B Rajaa said the state has already got commitments for investments to the tune of Rs 3 lakh crore by way of Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) inked with various companies.These investments will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, he said and asserted that the state is progressing in its vision to become a USD 1 trillion economy by 2030.Apart from auto and electronic manufacturing activities, Tamil Nadu has come out with an Electric Vehicle (EV) policy that is aimed at attracting investments worth Rs 50,000 crore and generating 1.50 lakh jobs in the fast growing EV segment.The GIM is scheduled to be held on January 7 and 8, 2024.""Now, moving into GIM, we have a totally different target apart from Rs 3 lakh crore worth of investments which have come in. We are expecting a few lakh crores of investments more to come in,"" Rajaa said.The opposition party in the state assembly, AIADMK, conducted its flagship GIM in 2015 under the then chief minister J Jayalalithaa and had garnered investment commitments of Rs 2.42 lakh crore.Without divulging specific details about the expected investments, he said, ""I cannot give you any number (on the target). It will be bigger than any other GIM held before."" In May this year, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M K Stalin went on a nine-day tour to Singapore and Japan to woo investors into the state. He had also undertaken a trip to Dubai in 2021 to seek investments.""The key motive of the visit to Singapore and Japan was to extend an invitation to investors for the 2024 GIM,"" Stalin had said.About the GIM, Rajaa said that after DMK assumed office in May 2021, whatever the government has done, it made sure that there was a ""good hit rate"".""Even if we do something close to about 75-80 per cent, we will be able to get 75 per cent of realisation of the MoUs signed and I think that is good,"" he said.The state has received some big-ticket investment commitments in recent times, including Renault-Nissan Automotive India Pvt Ltd committing Rs 5,300 crore to support new product launches and projects which would create 2,000 jobs.The logo of GIM depicts the Tamil word 'tha' which the chief minister had said symbolises that the state offers a perfect blend of timeless tradition, thriving industrial ecosystem, technological advancement, treasured talent and social inclusion.""Tamil Nadu is your gateway to endless opportunities,"" he had said.Taiwan-based Hon Hai Technology Group, popularly known as Foxconn, has also committed investments of Rs 1,600 crore for a new mobile component manufacturing unit in the state.According to government officials, Tamil Nadu had signed 241 MoUs with various companies which have committed investments of Rs 2,97,196 lakh crore. These investments are expected to generate 4,15,282 new jobs in the state.Rajaa said that currently, Chennai, Hosur and Coimbatore have emerged as the favourite places among investors.""For example, it may be in southern districts where in places like delta districts (Thanjavur, Tiruvarur) you can do food processing. Then, again in western belt, you can see the booming of electric vehicle clusters. And the proximity to Bengaluru from Hosur is there, so we can also try and get the information technology crowd,"" he said.Further, he said that in the southern parts of the state, entities can look for renewable power generation.The state is a major electronics exporter.According to Rajaa, electronic exports reached an all-time high of USD 4.8 billion and is expected to touch USD 8 billion by the end of this financial year.Tamil Nadu leads in electronic exports with USD 4.78 billion as of October 31, 2023, followed by Uttar Pradesh at USD 2.58 billion, he noted.In addition, the government is moving ahead with industry specific policies, including an organic farming policy that was launched in March 2023 and is aimed at 'chemical-free organic' agriculture in the state.On the EV front, the government's policy was introduced as battery-operated vehicles are expected to play a crucial role in ensuring last-mile connectivity.""The government was giving a big push for EV. Of all the EVs sold in India, 70 per cent of two-wheelers and 40 per cent of four-wheelers were manufactured in Tamil Nadu.""A huge number is being manufactured in Tamil Nadu and the consumption in Tamil Nadu is also picking up now. We are also building the EV ecosystem in the state,"" Rajaa said.Ola Electric has committed investments of Rs 7,614 crore to roll out electric light motor vehicles from its manufacturing facility in Ranipet, Tamil Nadu.The investments will include setting up of lithium-cell manufacturing facilities with a capacity of 20 GW, and are expected to generate 3,111 new jobs in the state, as per the company."

India has committed a net zero emission target by 2070.,"India will witness more than 83 per cent increase in investments in renewable energy projects to around USD 16.5 billion in 2024 as the country focuses on energy transition to reduce carbon emissions, according to power ministry estimates.This is in line with India's ambitious target of having 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030 and its resolve to reduce overall power generation capacity from fossil fuels to less than 50 per cent. India has committed a net zero emission target by 2070.However, Union Power and New & Renewable Energy Minister R K Singh has said on many occasions that as much as 65 per cent power generation capacity would be from non-fossil fuels by 2030 and that would be higher than the set target of 50 per cent.In an interview to PTI, Singh said, ""India is likely to witness 25 GW of renewable energy capacity addition entailing an investment of Rs 1,37,500 crore (about USD 16.5 billion) in 2024 calendar year, which would be higher than 13.5 GW with an investment of Rs 74,250 crore (nearly USD 9 billion) seen in 2023.""Apart from solar and wind energy, India has increased its focus on green hydrogen in a big way to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, mainly diesel, which is required for long haul vehicles.India is a diesel-based economy in a way that most of the commercial vehicles for passenger and freight services are using diesel as the fuel.In January this year, the Union Cabinet approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission with an outlay of Rs 19,744 crore.Later in July, the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) called bids for providing incentives for the production of 4,50,000 tonnes of green hydrogen and 1.5 GW of electrolyser manufacturing facilities annually.As many 21 firms bid for incentives for electrolyser manufacturing of 3.4 GW and 14 companies for green hydrogen production of 5,53,730 tonnes under the Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) Scheme (Mode-1-Tranche-I).Reliance Electrolyser Manufacturing, Adani New Industries, L&T Electrolysers and Bharat Heavy Electricals were among the 21 companies that have bid for the government's incentives to set up 3.4 GW of annual capacity for manufacturing electrolysers.The other companies that have bid were Hild Electric Private, Ohmium Operations, John Cockerill Greenko Hydrogen Solutions, Waaree Energies, Jindal India, Avaada Electrolyser, Green H2 Network India, Advait Infratech, ACME Cleantech Solutions and Oriana Power.Matrix Gas and Renewables, HHP Seven, HomiHydrogen, Newtrace, C. Doctor & Company, Pratishna Engineers and LiveHy Energy also participated in the bidding.The 14 companies that evinced interest for incentives to set up production facilities of green hydrogen were ACME Cleantech Solutions, Torrent Power, UPL, GH4INDIA, Aneeka Universal, Sembcorp Green Hydrogen India, Greenko ZeroC and CESC Projects.Others were JSW Neo Energy, Welspun New Energy, Avaada GreenH2, Reliance Green Hydrogen and Green Chemicals, HHP Two, and Bharat Petroleum Corporation.The National Green Hydrogen Mission is aimed at making India a global hub for manufacturing this clean source of energy and is expected to lead to the development of 5 million metric tonnes per annum of green hydrogen production capacity by 2030.The mission provides for setting up of two green hydrogen hubs in the initial phase.The Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways has identified three major ports -- Deendayal, Paradip, and V O Chidambaranar (Tuticorin) Ports -- to be developed as hydrogen hubs.Singh said that India has 7.8 million tonnes of green hydrogen capacity at different stages.The Strategic Interventions for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT) scheme, backed by Rs 17,490 crore, will help catalyse the production of green hydrogen and electrolysers, develop the green hydrogen ecosystem and enable industrial decarbonisation.Vineet Mittal -- Chairman of industry body CII's Taskforce on Green Hydrogen & Co-Chairman of CII Renewable Energy Council -- said India's dedication to environmental sustainability aligns with the global shift towards green hydrogen and its derivatives.""However, meeting the additional renewable energy demand and establishing a robust ecosystem for green hydrogen and green ammonia will be pivotal in 2024."" Leveraging the renewable energy potential, India can emerge as a production hub to meet the escalating demand for green hydrogen derivatives, Mittal, who is also the Chairman of Avaada Group, said.Observing that the outlook for renewable energy in 2024 is positive, Rahul Munjal, Co-Chairman of CII Renewable Energy Council, said there is an expectation of continued investment and technological advancements, particularly in areas of renewable energy and battery storage.Munjal is also the Chairman and Managing Director of Hero Future Energies.A comprehensive vision outlined in the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) report on Optimal Generation Mix by 2030 targets 292 GW of solar, 100 GW of wind, and 18 GW of hydro, presenting ample opportunities for diverse investments in the sector.""To achieve the goal of 292 GW solar installations and 100 GW wind installations by 2030, large-scale tenders (up to 5 GW) should be issued by REIAs (Renewable Energy Implementing Agencies) to maximise the execution capabilities of developers,"" Shekhar Dutt, Director General of Solar Power Developers Association (SPDA), said.He also pitched for mandating Green Hydrogen Consumption Obligations (GHCOs) for key industrial sectors to promote green hydrogen usage.Girishkumar Kadam, Senior Vice President & Co-Group Head - Corporate Ratings at ICRA, said the installed renewable energy capacity, excluding large hydro, in India is estimated to increase to about 170 GW by March 2025 from the level of 132 GW as of October 2023.Moreover, he said the capacity addition thereafter is likely to be supported by the significant improvement in tendering activity in the current fiscal with over 16 GW projects bid out so far and another 17 GW bids underway by the central nodal agencies.This is in line with the 50 GW annual bidding trajectory announced by the government in March 2023, he added."

The consumption of finished steel jumped 14 per cent to 86.97 MT on an annual basis during the same period, as per data from the steel ministry.India has set a target of having an installed steel manufacturing capacity of 300 MT by 2030. At present, the country has a capacity of around 161 MT.""We are preparing for PLI 2.0 for the steel sector. It is under discussion at various levels,"" Kulaste said while talking about the government's priorities for the steel industry in 2024.In an interview to PTI, the Minister of State (MoS) for Steel also said the government will ensure raw material supply for the steel industry and the focus will also be on promoting the use of scrap.Further, efforts will be made to push for the use of artificial intelligence and new age technologies among the industry players to boost steel output while also look at reducing carbon emissions, Kulaste, who also holds the portfolio of MoS Rural Development, said.The government had approved the PLI scheme 1.0 to boost the production of speciality steel that would help create additional capacity of around 25 MT.On production and demand for steel, the minister said they will grow significantly in 2024 on the back of infrastructure projects.All steel players are increasing their capacities and to ensure ease of doing business, the government has been helping them with clearances related to their projects, Kulaste said.""Our ministry remains in constant touch with the state governments and its officials to help them with any issue that comes in their projects,"" he said, adding the government is also engaged with several countries to explore alternate options for sourcing of coking coal.On the other hand, the Indian Steel Association (ISA) said that surging imports and high raw material prices will remain a concern for the industry in the new year after experiencing ""dumping of steel products"" especially from China and Vietnam in the past.India remains dependent on imports to meet 90 per cent of its coking coal requirement. In 2023 so far, the imports have been between 70-80 MT.ISA Secretary General Alok Sahay said the industry continued to face the issue of imports and expects strong measures from the government to check the surge in imports which is affecting the domestic market.The grouping, which represents the interest of the domestic steel industry, expects steel production to be in the range of 123-127 MT in FY24.Finished steel imports into India showed a growth of 18 per cent to 5.87 MT in January-November 2023 from 4.96 MT in the same period of 2022. The exports from India showed a decline of 20 per cent to 6 MT from 7.46 MT during the corresponding period last year, ISA said.Sahay further said the government is actively considering the inclusion of refractories in the upcoming PLI scheme 2.0 for steel and will align with the ambitious goal of doubling the country's steel production capacity to 300 MT by the year 2030.Meanwhile, Kulaste has also urged the steel makers, including state-owned SAIL and RINL, to increase their product mix keeping in mind the growing needs of various sectors where steel is required.Tata Steel said it is seeing green shoots of demand recovery on the back of increased infrastructure spending in advanced economies to help the overall decarbonisation efforts. The auto sector, another key area for steel, is also showing good recovery.""Muted consumption and investments affected steel demand across the world in 2023. Inflationary pressures coupled with geopolitical developments like wars in Ukraine and West Asia, contributed to the uncertainty. While supply chain bottlenecks eased, the manufacturing sector did not see significant improvement on the demand side,"" the company said.Ranjan Dhar, Chief Marketing Officer of ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India), said economic fluctuations and supply chain disruptions posed significant challenges. The steel sector successfully navigated these hurdles by adopting agile strategies, investing in research and development and fostering resilient supply chains, he added.Jayant Acharya, Joint MD & CEO of JSW Steel, said India's steel sector has registered an impressive growth of 15 per cent this year on the back of robust economic growth driven by infrastructure, manufacturing, energy transition and allied sectors.India is the fastest growing major economy in the world and is at an inflexion point, which would lead to a massive build-up of infrastructure, capacity additions in manufacturing sectors reflecting 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat', and investments spurred by the imperative of energy transition, he said.According to him, steel demand in the medium-to-long-term is likely to accelerate at a significantly faster pace than GDP.Ratings agency Crisil said strong domestic demand, supported by government spending on infrastructure, building and construction segments, is expected to keep India's steel imports elevated around 6 MT this fiscal even as the global steel industry battles a slowdown.Jayanta Roy, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, at ICRA said, during April to November of FY2024, with the government front loading infrastructure spending ahead of the upcoming Union elections, domestic steel consumption growth remained strong at 14.8 per cent."

India's agriculture exports will be 10.1 per cent of India's merchandise exports. This decline is exacerbated by the concentration of exports in a few products like rice and sugar, making the market susceptible to global price fluctuations and policy constraints, such as export bans and WTO disputes,"" it added.However, it said that India is learning from global developments and implementing innovative initiatives like farm-to-fork and traceability systems across various agricultural products to enhance quality, safety, and market accessibility.GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said, ""Indian agriculture faces significant challenges, including a heavy reliance on rice and sugar, which makes it vulnerable to global market fluctuations and domestic policy changes and unorganised sector activity."" He suggested a rethink on the sector as export earnings do not justify input or environmental costs in most cases.The sector is hindered by inadequate cold chain infrastructure and inefficient logistics, leading to spoilage and export competitiveness issues, Srivastava said, adding quality and traceability inconsistencies, along with high non-tariff barriers in international markets, further impede export potential.""At the policy level, India's large public stockholding for food security is a contentious issue at the WTO, with ongoing negotiations adding to the uncertainty. These challenges, compounded by global agricultural trends and the dominance of a few large firms in the international grain trade, highlight the need for strategic improvements in infrastructure, quality control, and policy adaptation to enhance India's agricultural sector's global competitiveness,"" the report said.The three primary categories for exports are -- basic agriculture products, processed agriculture products, and other products.According to the GTRI's forecast, basic agriculture products will see a decrease in export value from USD 24.8 billion in 2022 to USD 22.3 billion in 2023, marking a 10 per cent decline. This category constituted a significant 51.5 per cent share of India's total agricultural exports.Processed agricultural product exports may dip from USD 16.3 billion last year to USD 15.7 billion in 2023. The sector accounts for 36.3 per cent of the total exports.It added that other product categories can register a dip of 5.6 per cent to USD 5.3 billion in 2023 from USD 5.6 billion in 2022. It accounts for 12.2 per cent of total exports.Non-basmati rice exports have dipped by 12.2 per cent to USD 5.51 billion so far this year (2023). However, basmati rice exports rose by 17.7 per cent to USD 5.3 billion this calendar year.Sugar exports dipped by 32.4 per cent to about USD 4 billion so far this calendar year. Spices and oil meal exports have increased by 8.5 per cent and 48.6 per cent to USD 3.72 billion and USD 1.,83 billion during the period under consideration.The other agri products which India exports include coffee, castor oil, fresh fruits, tobacco, processed fruits and juices, groundnut, fresh vegetables, Ayush and herbal goods, meat, silk, wool and cotton, dairy, and live animals."

But as usual there are risk factors too","Sensex, the benchmark equity index, closed at an all time high of 70,514.2 on December 14, 2023 which translates into a 16 percent annual return.

Investing in equity schemes almost quadrupled from Rs 5.7 lakh crores in March 2020 to Rs 20.3 lakh crores in November 2023.* BJP winning all the 3 Hindi Heartland states Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh has provided momentum to the markets, signaling return of NDA in 2024 general elections.The performance in the Indian stock markets has not been in isolation. Despite concerns over recession SPX 500 (the US benchmark equity index) has delivered 22 percent returns in the last one year.The performance of Indian stocks has been far more widespread as compared to the previous years. An analysis of the different sectors shows that 10 of the 15 sectors have delivered higher returns than the benchmark Sensex from April 2020 to November 2023 period.2024 - Momentum Till General ElectionsSensex has risen 5.3 percent this month since exit polls were released on November 30.  BJP’s victory portends continuity in policies and programmes addressing concerns that Congress party’s victory might have stoked a fiscally populist agenda. With latest opinion polls predicting a NDA return, the markets are likely to maintain this momentum till the general election results in May next year.The uptick in domestic participation, record number of demat accounts being opened year after year and all-time high collections of SIP with flows at Rs. 17,073 crore for the month of November 2023 provide cushion to the markets.High earnings growth of corporates in 2024 is likely to provide a fillip to the markets. HSBC forecasts earnings growth of 17.8 percent for India in 2024 — among the fastest rates in Asia. Sectors such as banks, health care and energy, which have already done well this year are best positioned for 2024, according to HSBC.India continues to be the fastest growing major economy in the world. GDP growth in the second quarter of financial year 2023-24 was much better than market expectations at 7.6 percent led by a strong rebound in the manufacturing sector.The market players are expecting a rate cut next year as inflation cools down to 5 percent levels. Lower interest rates tend to increase liquidity as investors move from low return products like FDs to equity markets.The US Fed too has signaled that its interest rate hiking policy is at an end and it will cut rates in 2024. Market analysts are now projecting up to three rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2024.This had a notable impact, propelling the Dow Jones Industrial Average beyond the 37,000 mark for the first time. The US Treasury 10-year yield crashed to sub 4 percent levels which could trigger large capital flows to India.Indian equities have historically aligned to FII inflow movements. Most of the time Sensex delivers positive month-on-month growth whenever FIIs are net buyers, which holds true for around 70 percent of the time.2024 - Risk Factors The market capitalisation to GDP ratio has been hovering consistently above 100 percent in the last twelve months. When MCap/GDP ratio breaches 100 percent, Sensex tends to correct. Traditionally many believe being over 100 percent indicates the market is overvalued, while others see the “new normal” is closer to 100 percent as the number of IPOs have increased.Amidst the high interest rate scenario prevalent globally, geopolitical tensions and developed countries focusing on deglobalisation due to domestic growth challenges, India’s economic growth might take a breather in 2024.While S&P has revised its financial year 2023-2024 GDP growth forecast to 6.4 percent from 6 percent as “robust domestic momentum seems to have offset headwinds from high food inflation and weak exports”, it has lowered the growth projection for financial year 2024-2025 to 6.4 percent from 6.9 percent earlier.The sentiment is positive as we enter into 2024. However, caution is warranted especially while investing in small and mid cap stocks where valuations are expensive.

And while India's GDP growth in July-September had been ""surprisingly strong"", its uneven nature is a cause for worry.","While the Union government is taking numerous steps to tide over the supply-demand mismatch in key food items, the issue will require key interventions for a long-term solution, Shashanka Bhide, one of the three external members on the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), has said.""More focused attention to short-term supply-demand mismatches in the present circumstances appear necessary. However, in the longer term, technology and infrastructure initiatives would need to play a greater role,"" Bhide told Moneycontrol on December 22, after the release of the minutes of the December 6-8 meeting of the MPC.Also Read: Need major supply chain reforms to control food price shocks, says RBI bulletinBhide's comments come after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November showed headline retail inflation rising to a three-month high of 5.55 percent, driven by an unfavourable base effect and a jump in food inflation to 8.7 percent from 6.61 percent in October.While the prices of major vegetables, such as tomato and onion, have been volatile, those of other food items such as cereals and pulses have been stubbornly high, with the government, on December 22, announcing a one-year extension to the import duty exemption for masur dal until March 2025.However, India's trade restrictions to alleviate domestic food pressures have been criticised by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which said in its latest Article IV consultation staff report that the government must ""expeditiously"" remove barriers to the trade of food items so that global food supply improves. Further, it recommended agricultural sector reforms for ""a more durable solution to fostering domestic food security"".According to Bhide, India is beginning to see a ""more focused policy response"" to supply-chain issues affecting prices. However, he warned that as growth rises, price pressures will be impacted by production capacity expansion and supply-chain issues.Uneven growthAlthough Bhide admitted in his statement in the minutes of the December 6-8 meeting that India's GDP growth in July-September had been ""surprisingly strong"", he remains concerned about its uneven nature, illustrated by the agriculture sector growth falling to a four-and-a-half-year low of 1.2 percent and production of consumer durables up a mere 1.4 percent in the first seven months of 2023-24.Private consumption, meanwhile, was up just 3.1 percent in the second quarter.As far as the rural economy is concerned, Bhide sees its diversification as key to providing a buffer against fluctuations in agricultural income in the long term. On the other hand, he said weak growth in private consumption and production of consumer durables seem to be ""a reflection of the uneven pace of overall growth, including some of the services. These, however, appear to be short-term issues,"" according to Bhide, an honorary senior advisor for the Delhi-based National Council of Applied Economic Research.""After all, the auto sector is experiencing rapid growth and so is the demand for credit. For sustained high growth, both consumption and demand would have to share the momentum,"" he added.Also Read: Faster reduction in fiscal deficit will send 'very good signal', says MPC's Ashima GoyalOn the whole, the economy's growth turnout over the last 12 months has been better than anticipated. Back in December 2022, Bhide had told Moneycontrol that the global slowdown and its impact on the Indian economy would be a key consideration for India's monetary policy.While a slowdown in global growth ""is still a concern"", the large size of India's economy has helped maintain growth momentum, thanks to public investment and recovery in demand. ""Stronger global growth will present more opportunities for fiscal consolidation as well,"" Bhide said."

Following its peak, the market saw a substantial four percent decline on the same day, with most stocks participating in the downturn. Despite expectations of a correction in the market, the abrupt fall caught everyone off guard. In a single day, the market incurred a staggering loss of Rs 9 lakh crore in market capitalisation.Various factors, ranging from the spread of COVID to changes in margin norms by exchanges and collective profit booking by funds, were touted as reasons, but none could be substantiated. By the end of the day, reports indicated that cash selling by funds was moderate, adding an element of mystery to the crash.Notably, the decline was confined to Indian markets, as global markets traded flat during the downturn in India. However, by late evening, even US markets began to experience a decline.Fortunately, markets rebounded robustly on Thursday, concluding the week on a flat note with a modest decline of nearly 0.5 percent. Even more remarkable is that, despite the market downturn, foreign participants persisted in increasing their long positions in the derivative market. It is noteworthy that they simultaneously divested equities amounting to Rs 6,422.24 crore in the cash market.Are The Technicals Indicating A Correction? Nifty has given a negative weekly close after seven consecutive positive weekly closes and has formed a spinning top candlestick pattern, indicating indecisiveness. This can be an initial warning of a short-term correction provided there is follow-up selling in the coming week, and the Nifty breaks the low of the weekly candle, i.e. 20976. On the way down, 20DMA at 20831 will be an important support.Closing below the 20DMA can lead to a slightly deeper correction, lasting for a few days or weeks.The upside potential in the near term appears to be limited. The most optimistic scenario is that Nifty forms a distribution pattern, potentially reaching slightly higher levels from the recent peak but not significantly higher.The decline observed on December 20th (Wednesday) caused the swing indicator to plummet to 8, marking an extremely oversold condition. Subsequently, Nifty rebounded as anticipated, recovering the swing indicator to 36 levels.For the bullish momentum to persist, the Nifty must surpass the recent high of 21,593, potentially pushing the swing indicator back into the overbought territory around 80. However, if Nifty fails to breach the recent high and instead breaks the low of 20,976, the swing indicator may revert to oversold conditions, indicating a potential positive divergence before establishing a significant bottom in the short term.Source: web.strike.moneyA surprising feature of the week was that despite a sharp fall, FIIs continued to add to their long bets in the market. FII's net long position in the index futures currently stands at 84,690 contracts and is in close proximity to the overbought levels (second red line) of 90,000 contracts.Post 2020, the FIIs' net long positions in the index futures have peaked at 90,000–1,05,000 contracts. The highest long positions in the index futures by FIIs post-2020 were around 1,05,000 contracts in July 2023.In the upcoming trading sessions, close attention should be paid to two critical factors. Firstly, the unwinding of long positions by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) warrants careful monitoring. Secondly, a significant indicator is the potential price reversal in the Nifty index, specifically the break of the 20-day average at 20,831. If this level is breached concurrent with FIIs unwinding, it may signify a deeper correction or an extended period of consolidation.Source: web.strike.moneyWhile the FIIs added to their long position, the clients' net short positions in the index futures have been the highest since 2017 and below the second red line. Typically, Nifty makes a short-term or a medium-term top when the short positions have reached this extreme, as seen in the chart below. Currently, it stands at 85,251 contracts. Before 2018, we have seen net short positions up to 2,90,000, but in the past five years, the index futures have been in the range of +1,55,000 to – 80,000 contracts.We are at a crucial point with Nifty breaking below the 20DMA, i.e. 20831, which can possibly lead to a short-term or a medium-term correction.Source: web.strike.moneyOptions DataTraders moved their positions as the market swayed. Starting the week, Put writers had a larger position, but by mid-week, Call writers had a commanding position. Thursday saw Put writers wrestle back their position. However, by the end of the week, the market is evenly poised, with Put writers having a slight edge, indicating a flat market.Source: Icharts.inWith the last settlement of the month and the year and foreign traders enjoying the year-end holidays, we can expect a flattish market on low volume.Indices and Market BreadthDuring the week, most indices touched a new high before receding. During the week, the BSE Sensex lost 0.52 percent while Nifty50 declined by 0.49 percent.The new all-time high made by Sensex is 71,913.07, while that of Nifty is 21,593.Smaller indices also touched new highs, but the sharp fall on Wednesday took the wind out of these stocks, resulting in a negative closing for the week.The Nifty PSU Bank index was the worst performer during the week, falling by 3 per cent, the Media index was down 2 per cent, and the Auto index fell by 1.4 per cent. Nifty FMCG and Pharma indices closed the week in positive territory, gaining one percent each.Among the top gainers in the week are PC Jewellers, which gained 59.35 per cent, Salasar Techno Engineering was up by 31.63 per cent, and Gallantt Ispat gained 28.06 per cent. Top losers were IIFL Finance, down 11.85 percent, Allcargo Gati, down 11.61 percent, and Sunteck Realty, which lost 9.81 percent during the week.Global MarketsThe US markets continued to go up, with all three US indices recording the eighth consecutive weekly gain. This is the longest weekly winning streak for the S&P 500 since late 2017. For the Nasdaq and the Dow, it marks the longest streak of consecutive weekly gains since 2019.While Indian markets made new highs in the fourth quarter of 2023, the S&P 500 is within one percent of its all-time high in January 2022.European markets were mixed, with pan-Euro Stoxx 600 closing marginally higher, though CAC, DAX and Italy’s MIB closed lower during the week. UK’s FTSE ended the week gaining 1.6 per cent, the most among leading European markets, as the UK’s retail inflation slowed more than expected.Asian markets also were mixed during the week. Shanghai and Hang Seng traded in the negative while Nikkei closed in positive territory. The Chinese government’s restrictions in the gaming sector pulled its market lower.Stocks To WatchAmong the frontline stocks showing strong momentum on the upside are Voltas, Hindustan Copper, HDFC AMC, MPhasis, Persistent, BEL and Wipro.Stocks showing weakness are M&M, AB Capital, Apollo Tyres, City Union Bank, Dabur and Escorts.Cheers,Shishir Asthana"

A faster reduction will send a very good signal,"" Goyal told Moneycontrol following the release of the minutes of the December 6-8 meeting of the MPC, on December 22.Also Read: Steady progress on inflation, but next steps are crucialThe rate-setter's comments come just over a month before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the 2024-25 interim budget on February 1, with the Lok Sabha elections expected to be held in the second quarter of 2024. While the finance ministry is seen to be meeting this year's fiscal deficit target of 5.9 percent of GDP, it will have to target a significant reduction next year if it wants to achieve its medium-term objective of reducing the deficit to 4.5 percent by 2025-26.""Steady reduction in government debt to East Asian levels will improve Indian ratings, reduce risk premiums and the cost of borrowing abroad. It will also show how unfounded is the IMF prediction that Indian government debt is likely to exceed 100 percent of GDP from current levels of 81 percent,"" Goyal added, referring to the IMF's (International Monetary Fund) observations in its recent Article IV consultation report that given the shocks India has faced, its debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 100 percent in the medium term.According to IMF data, India's general government debt – Centre plus states – in 2022 stood at 81 percent of its GDP, well above the figures for East Asian countries such as Vietnam (39 percent), Indonesia (40 percent), Philippines (58 percent), Thailand (61 percent), and Malaysia (66 percent).More immediately, Goyal thinks the Centre ""should not be tempted to overspend"" on account of buoyant tax revenues. ""This is what unfortunately happened in the high growth period the 2000s, and led to the macroeconomic vulnerabilities of the 2010s"", she said, adding that the interim budget should continue to focus on building physical and human capital — areas that see sub-optimal private investment. However, she also sees ""well-designed incentives"" and better governance resulting in better outcomes, even if the expenditure is lower.""For example, we have universal school enrolment and new colleges and universities are mushrooming, but attention now has to be paid to the quality of education. More delegation to the third-tier and accountability to the user will help improve public services,"" Goyal explained.Inflation and rate cutsDays after Goyal and her fellow MPC members left the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the fifth meeting in a row, statistics ministry data showed that the headline retail inflation rate had jumped to a three-month high of 5.55 percent in November. However, not only was the print lower than expected, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is seen to be easing in 2024, with the RBI pegging it at 4 percent in July-September 2024.In her statement in the minutes of the December 6-8 meeting, Goyal warned that if inflation moves towards the medium-term target of 4 percent in a sustainable manner by mid-2024, real interest rates ""can easily become too high if nothing is done"".In her interview with Moneycontrol, Goyal clarified that by 'if nothing is done' she was referring to rate cuts. At the same time, she warned that commodity shocks in the past had stopped the RBI's inflation forecasts from approaching 4 percent. Therefore, it is essential the MPC waits for more data to confirm that the inflation downtrend is sustaining. ""Data coming in the next few months is not expected to lead to a rise in forecasts,"" she added.While headline inflation rose in November, core CPI inflation eased to 4.1 percent. According to Goyal, Emeritus Professor at Mumbai's Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, falling core inflation suggests the output gap is not yet positive.Also Read: India's 'output gap' is now positive, says RBI bulletinOutput gap is the difference between an economy's actual output and what it can potentially produce. When the gap is positive, it can lead to demand-pull inflationary pressures.Asked if the MPC should target core inflation instead of the headline number, which is heavily influenced by volatile food prices, Goyal pointed out that the headline inflation number is key as it impacts consumer welfare, household inflation expectations, and second-round inflationary effects (price and wage hikes by firms in response to increase in prices of items such as food and fuel). As such, reducing headline inflation is a ""valid social goal,"" she said.Smaller food basketAt the same time, the large weight of food and commodities in the CPI basket means supply-side measures and co-ordination between fiscal and monetary authorities ""is the way to reduce inflation with the least growth sacrifice,"" Goyal noted.The increase in retail inflation in November was driven primarily by an unfavourable base effect and a rise in food prices, particularly of vegetables, which propelled food inflation to 8.7 percent from 6.61 percent in October. However, Goyal sees some positives in India's overall food inflation dynamics.""Although volatility has increased, its persistence and pass-through to core inflation has fallen. Under mature inflation targeting, transient supply shocks can be overlooked as inflation expectations stay anchored. We seem to be getting there,"" she explained.Also Read: RBI may have to wait until 2026 for updated CPI inflation seriesWhat may be helping reduce the pass-through of food inflation to headline inflation may be the fact that the weight of food items in a consumer's basket is lower than what the CPI assumes.""On average, food now comprises about 30 percent of the consumption basket. So second round pass-through from food to core inflation is lower.

The inflow was at USD 62.66 billion in the year-ago period. ”However, we are broadly in line with the overall trends of FDI growth. FDI inflows from 2014-23 period is about USD 596 billion, which is about double than what India received during 2005-14. The trend is positive and India is still the preferred destination for foreign players,” Singh told PTI.According to him, Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes for sectors like pharma, food processing, and medical appliances have started yielding fruits and are attracting foreign investors. ”Many of these sectors have seen a jump in FDI,” Singh said. He said the major reasons for the shortfall in FDI inflows could include the threat of global recession, economic crisis due to Russia-Ukraine conflict and protectionist measures.A decline in real GDP growth rates of Singapore, the USA and the UK could also be a factor as these countries are major sources for FDI into India, he added. Singh also emphasised that India continues to open up its economy to global investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure and improving the business environment.Experts also opined that despite the global challenges, India is still the preferred investment destination. Steps taken to promote ease of doing business, availability of skilled manpower, natural resources, liberal FDI policy, huge domestic market and PLI schemes are the reasons for optimism with respect to foreign fund inflows in 2024, they said.According to UNCTAD’s World Investment Report 2023, the number of greenfield investment projects announced in developing countries increased by 37 per cent. ”This is a positive sign for investment prospects in industry and in infrastructure,” it said. Rumki Majumdar, an economist at consultancy Deloitte India, said the slowdown in capital flows has been more a function of tightening global liquidity and geopolitical uncertainties. ”But soon the world will recognise the strength of the fundamentals India has and India will see capital flows rising,” she said.Majumdar said there is a genuine interest among global investors to tap into the potential of India and be a part of the growth journey that the country is likely to see over the decade. Anindya Ghosh, partner at law firm IndusLaw, said it needs to be noted that global FDI has also dropped by a considerable margin and India can take some sense of comfort from the fact that it is not the only country bearing the wrath of the recent economic downturn. ”While there has been a lot of concerns pertaining to the decline in FDI in India recently, statistics indicate that FDI inflows might witness a modest increase in the year 2024,” Ghosh said.As per the National Statistical Office (NSO), the Indian economy grew 7.7 per cent in the first half of 2023-24. The country’s foreign exchange reserve is above USD 600 billion and industrial production accelerated to a 16-month high of 11.7 per cent in October, mainly due to double-digit growth in the output of manufacturing, power and mining sectors. Also, PLI schemes that seek to boost India’s manufacturing capabilities and exports have been announced for 14 sectors.The total outlay for the schemes is Rs 1.97 lakh crore and the sectors covered include white goods, telecom and auto components. During the period between April 2000 to September 2023, total FDI into India reached USD 953.14 billion.About one-fourth of the FDI came through the Mauritius route during the period under review. It was followed by Singapore (23 per cent), the US (9 per cent), the Netherlands (7 per cent), Japan (6 per cent) and the UK (5 per cent). The UAE, Germany, Cyprus, and Cayman Islands accounted for 2 per cent each. The key sectors which attracted the maximum FDI in India include the services segment, computer software and hardware, telecommunications, trading, construction development, automobile, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. FDI is allowed through the automatic route in most of the sectors while in areas such as telecom, media, pharmaceuticals and insurance, government approval is required for foreign investors.Under the government approval route, a foreign investor has to take a prior nod of the ministry or department concerned whereas under the automatic route, an overseas investor is only required to inform the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) after the investment is made. At present, FDI is prohibited in certain sectors. They are lottery, gambling and betting, chit funds, nidhi company, real estate business, and manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes using tobacco. FDI is important as India would require huge investments in the coming years for its infrastructure sector to boost growth. Healthy foreign inflows also help in maintaining the balance of payments and the value of the rupee."

This was the highest monthly inflow by them in a year. This came following a net investment of Rs 9,000 crore in October.Before this overseas investors withdrew 39,300 crore in August and September, data with the depositories showed. The robust inflow from FPIs into the Indian stock markets can be attributed to various factors. Primary among these are political stability and positive sentiments prevailing in the Indian markets, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director- Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said.Also, the country’s stable and robust economy, coupled with impressive corporate earnings and a string of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs), has attracted foreign investors to explore investment opportunities in India, he added.Vijayakumar said that the steady decline in U.S. bond yields has caused this sudden change in the strategy of FPIs. ”India’s market engine is revving: Strong GDP growth exceeding estimates, coupled with a burgeoning manufacturing sector, paints a vibrant picture for investors, ” Mayank Mehraa, smallcase manager and principal partner at Craving Alpha, said. Globally, the US Fed has signalled three potential rate cuts next year, indicating the end of the rate hike cycle, which bodes well for emerging markets like India.Bhuvan Rustagi, COO and Co-Founder, of Per Annum & Lendbox, said that easing Fed tightening, declining US treasury yields, and softening dollar.Additionally, there were India-specific factors that prompted FPIs to invest such as robust economic growth, political stability, improved corporate earnings, and attractive valuations.With regards to bonds, the debt market attracted Rs 15,545 crore during the period under review. This came after receiving an inflow of Rs 14,860 crore in November and Rs Rs 6,381 crore in October, data showed. In terms of sector, FPIs were big buyers in financial services and also showed interest in sectors like autos, capital goods, and telecom."

Foreign buying is picking up in anticipation of India’s inclusion in JP Morgan’s Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) from June 2024.The move is being keenly watched by market participants as it is expected to bring in inflows of $20 billion-$25 billion in index-eligible government securities between June 2024 and March 2025. Inflows will be staggered, in line with the staggered increase in India’s index weightage to 10 percent. The country’s inclusion in the GBI-EM index follows Russia’s exit from it.No doubt, the inflows will be beneficial for funding the country’s GDP growth. They will also help the government manage its fiscal and current account deficits, besides funding bank lending to corporates with the pick-up in the capex cycle. But will they move the needle on rates?Not significantly – or only momentarily as the flows will be staggered.Also read: Charting the global economy: Festive cheer for Fed as US inflation softens, BOJ sticks with negative ratesThe fact is that Indian bonds are no longer as attractive on interest rates to foreign investors as before. That’s because the spread between Indian and US government 10-year bond yields has narrowed to ~300 basis points from ~588bps in 2020. The spread dipped to ~235 bps when 10-year US Treasury yields surged beyond 5 percent in October-November this year. Although benchmark US Treasury yields have softened further following the Federal Reserve’s 13th December announcement of multiple rates cuts in 2024, the spreads are still not attractive enough. The last major inflow of FPI flows in the debt markets was in 2014. At that time, the spread was attractive at 642 bps, along with the Indian 10-year G-sec at 8.75 percent which was at a very appealing level on absolute basis too!Frankly, the 13-year-long low-rate regime from 2009 to 2021 was an aberration. Now that the genie of near zero rates and easy money has finally been put back into the bottle, it is unlikely to be let out again soon.Also read: Most sold mid-cap stocks by active fund managers in NovemberBesides, our linkage with US Fed action on rates is tenuous on the downward trendline. Although India tends to raise rates when the Fed increases its benchmark, we do not usually follow suit when it cuts rates. The Reserve Bank of India left the key repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the fifth consecutive time in its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on December 8, owing to inflationary concerns. So, the prolonged pause on interest rates is likely to continue in India into the first half of FY2025 at least.While core inflation has come down steadily – the CMIE’s Core CPI index (CPI excluding food, fuel and light, and fuel used for vehicles) fell to 4.2 percent in November 2023 from 4.5 percent in the previous month – food inflation continues to remain elevated and volatile. Higher food prices pushed up headline inflation to 5.6 percent in November from 4.9 percent in October 2023.Also read: Infosys loses $1.5 billion AI contract from global customerEconomic activity continues to be strong with the RBI expecting the economy to expand by 7 percent this FY. Also, the quantum of government borrowings is unlikely to come down in 2025 given the targeted fiscal deficit of 5.9 percent of GDP for 2023-24.In the past 26 years that I have been tracking the markets, government borrowing has never fallen in any single year. Also, while private sector capex is picking up, the government spending engine will still need to keep firing to fuel growth.The country’s inclusion in the JP Morgan GBI-EM index is expected to open doors to its inclusion in other indices such as the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index, which would increase foreign flows further. But nothing is on the cards yet. On the other hand, the risk of volatility and outflows from India will be constrained by the reputational risk to the GBI-EM index in the initial days.Also, since India has just been included into the index, the reshuffling/reduction in weights will take some time, especially as India is expected to grow at a potentially higher rate than other EM peers and the rest of the world. Thus, reducing Indian bonds in the Index will not be easy. One-time inflows will happen, although incremental flows may be lower assuming the expectation of a recession in the West.Benchmark interest rates are in neutral territory today, and home loan rates are fairly reasonable too at ~8.5 percent. The average yield for the 10-year G-Sec has also been ~7.20 percent for the last 10 years.Also read: Why this large smallcap fund is not worried despite the frothy marketsI expect the 10-year G-Sec yield to remain stable and range-bound between 7.20 percent and 7.30 percent in 2024, mainly due to the fact that demand for bonds will be limited to the Pensions and Insurance sector. There is a strong credit offtake in the banking system and therefore banks will not be investing in extra SLR (if not selling the extra stock). Debt flows in mutual funds have also slowed to a trickle in view of taxation changes, and therefore will not be active participants.In a high-growth economy, liquidity is expected to be tight, so there is no spare money to hold extra G-sec and the cost of funding is also high.While supply of bonds will continue to weigh on the markets, undoubtedly, some window of softening will open up as it did in 2023, but it is difficult to time the market. In any case, equities will continue to be the preferred asset class for foreign inflows.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, prices rose for the week due to positive U.S. economic news and concerns over potential ship attacks by Houthi rebels impacting supply costs.","Oil prices eased on Friday ahead of the long Christmas holiday weekend on expectations Angola could increase output after leaving OPEC, but rose for the week on positive U.S. economic news and worries Houthi ship attacks would boost supply costs.Brent futures fell 32 cents, or 0.4%, to settle at $79.07 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 33 cents, or 0.5%, to settle at $73.56.That left both benchmarks up about 3% for the week after gaining less than 1% last week.In the Middle East, more maritime carriers said they were avoiding the Red Sea due to attacks on vessels carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi militant group, which says it is responding to Israel’s war in Gaza.Major shippers Maersk and CMA CGM said they would impose extra charges linked to re-routing ships.The attacks have caused disruptions through the Suez Canal, which handles about 12% of world trade.”Direct pauses to supply are not the only reason oil prices will be moved by the Red Sea situation; freight rates and insurance costs are increasing,” said PVM analyst John Evans about the impact of the disruption.In Africa, meanwhile, Angola’s decision to leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) could open the way for Beijing to increase investment in the country’s oil and other sectors. Angola produces about 1.1 million barrels per day of oil.”It will take time for Angola oil production to rise even if China moves in there in a big way,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group, noting that the U.S. inflation data and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea should be more supportive of oil prices than any future increase in output from Angola.In Iraq, meanwhile, oil ministry spokesman Asim Jihad affirmed Iraq’s support for the OPEC+ agreement and its commitment to voluntary oil cuts.OPEC+ includes OPEC and allies like Russia.U.S INFLATION EASESIn the U.S., a key inflation reading came in softer than expected, boosting investor optimism that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) would lower borrowing costs next year.Lower interest rates cut consumer borrowing costs, which can boost economic growth and demand for oil.Expectations that the Fed is more likely to cut interest rates next year also helped reduce the U.S. dollar to its lowest since July against a basket of other currencies for a second day in a row.A weaker dollar can boost oil demand by making the fuel more expensive for buyers using other currencies.But all U.S. economic news was not positive.Sales of new U.S. single-family homes dropped to a one-year low in November, but the unexpected decline is probably temporary amid a chronic shortage of previously owned homes, which has been supporting demand for new construction."

He had spent hours discussing dot plots and all he could think of saying was ‘’The plot thickens’’. He put his head in his hands and groaned. He then opened the bottom drawer of his desk and poured out a large measure of Jack Daniel’s, hoping it would provide the inspiration for his speech. Many pegs later, he was fast asleep.The Ghost of Markets Past He was rudely awakened from a lovely dream featuring a bevvy of RBI’s dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models by thunder, lightning, and the appearance of a ghastly spectre. ""Wh-wh-who the hell are you?’’ stuttered Jay, “Did I imbibe too much liquidity?” “No, no,” the Spectre said reassuringly, “you’ve merely had half a bottle. I am no bourbon-fuelled fantasy, I am the Ghost of Markets Past.” He then caught Powell by the collar and whirled him back through time, with Powell just managing to grab the bottle before going.“Look around you,’’ said the ghost, ‘’to see what liquidity means”. Jay looked and cried, “Do I see the Maestro? Is that Alan Greenspan?” “Absolutely”, said the spectre, “behold the liquidity he hath unleashed.” And the Spectre rubbed Powell’s nose against the windows of decked-up Christmas dealing rooms with traders buying stocks hand over fist and laughing all the way to the bank, as the global economy created a tsunami of liquidity created by Greenspan. Looking carefully, Jay was taken aback to see a huge animal sitting quietly in a corner of the Fed. ‘’Is that Godzilla?” he asked. “That, my friend, is the mighty Fed Put, who has made mincemeat of a million bears,” laughed the ghoul.Jay then heard the people singing this little ditty, along the lines of ‘Twas the Night Before Christmas’:'Twas the night before Powell, and all through the exchange,Not a bear was stirring, not even in range.The stocks were all nestled in portfolios with flair,Hoping that negative returns will soon be rare.Sock options were hung by the chimney with care,In hopes that Santa Jay would soon be there.The traders were tucked up snugly in their beds,While visions of profits danced in their heads.”And then the Spirit pointed, and Jay saw a younger, trimmer version of himself in the Fed, cutting rates furiously during the pandemic crash and saving the global economy. With tears of joy in his eyes, he saw the Dow rise exponentially, while traders raised a toast to Jazzy Jay as they pocketed their bonuses. “Look how happy they all are,” said the Spectre, as they bought and sold SPACs, NFTs, bored apes and cryptocurrency frenziedly.“Why are you showing me all this?” Jay asked. “Don’t ask me, I’m just the tour guide,” were the ghost’s last words before he disappeared.The Ghost of Markets Present Powell scarcely had time to recover before another apparition made his appearance. “I am the Ghost of Markets Present”, he announced before catching hold of Jay and whirling him around the world’s markets. Everywhere that Jay looked, he found investors climbing walls, all the while muttering under their breaths. “What are they doing?” Jay asked the ghost. “They are climbing walls of worry,” said the Spirit, “while muttering ‘Higher for Longer’, ‘Higher for Longer’.“Is there no place where they are not worrying?” asked Jay sadly. ‘’There is one such place”, said the Spirit, whirling Jay to Mumbai. “They are celebrating Amrit Kaal here”, explained the Ghost, “by having an even bigger party than on Wall Street.” He took Powell to the Moneycontrol Pro Research Team, who were singing, to the tune of Jingle Bells:“IPO bells, IPO bells,IPOs all the wayOh, what fun it is to rideOn an IPO-powered sleigh, hey.Dashing through IPOs, listing gains in our sights,In the emerging markets, oh, what jolly heights!Powell at the helm, shielding us from fear,What fun it is to trade and spread the options market cheer! Oh!”And Ghoul pointed to the interview of the Indian prime minister by the Financial Times (free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers) where he said, “We aspire to create conditions where everyone sees value in being in India to invest and expand their operations here.” Cries of ‘’Jay-ji zindabad’’ rent the Indian trading rooms.But Jay was sad after reading an FT piece by Mohamed El-Erian on why the Fed should resist market bullying. “Won’t things get better?” he asked the Ghost plaintively. ‘’I am a wraith, not an astrologer or an economist or a market strategist”, said the Spirit, before vanishing in the dark.The Ghost of Markets Yet to Come Powell had got so used to meeting ghosts by now that he scarcely turned a hair when the next one came, merely holding out his hand, saying politely, “The Ghost of Markets Yet to Come, I presume?” The apparition silently unveiled a curtain, showing Jay the future.“Wasn’t Jay Powell the Fed chair who precipitated a huge global recession by keeping interest rates high?” a student was asking. At a school in the future, a young student was writing in her history paper: “Powell’s tenure at the Fed was marked by indecision, vacillation, prevarication and possibly indigestion as well”. In the background, against the snow, people were singing to the tune of ‘’Silent Night, Holy Night”:“Silent night, bears sitting tight,Stocks are down, not a bull in sight’’The ghost led him to a rash of sceptical write-ups published in Moneycontrol Pro, such as ‘Don’t take central bank pivots for granted, say Flash PMIs’, ‘Is a spoiler in the making for the Santa rally?’, ‘IMF report points to uneven growth, low productivity in Indian economy’, ‘RBI researchers warn against hasty rate cuts’, IT firms’ order books lose relevance amid spending cuts by clients’.FT articles such as ‘Bankruptcies soar as high rates and end of COVID aid hit businesses hard’, and ‘The world economy’s biggest problem is Africa’  warned of dire consequences, especially for poorer countries, fiscal mayhem and an explosion of debt if Powell insisted on not cutting rates.But what truly alarmed Jay was when the ghoul turned to him and asked ominously, “Do you really want to be like Christine Lagarde?” “No sir, certainly not”, said Jay, gulping down the rest of the bourbon in desperation.“O spook,” he implored, “please don’t spook the markets. Please tell me I can change all this for the better.” The ghost looked gently at him and said, “Have you forgotten, dear soul, that you have a weapon that can unleash a wave of happiness across the world? I speak, of course, of the Fed Funds rate.” And with that, the phantom melted away.Santa Jay Powell rally When Jay woke up from his unsettling visions, the first thing he did was throw open his window and sing full-throated, to the tune of “We wish you a Merry Christmas”:“We wish you a merry market, we wish you a merry trade,May your portfolios smartly parade.Inflation and GDP, in harmony they sing,Wishing you joy in this market fling!”And that, ladies and gentlemen, was why Powell delivered an ultra-dovish press conference after the FOMC meeting.The rest is history. Markets throughout the world caught the contagion of Jay Powell’s Yuletide spirit.

Cooling inflation left more income at the disposal of households, helping to underpin consumer spending and the overall economy as the year winds down.This was yet another data set showcasing the durability of the economic expansion, thanks to a resilient labor market.

""So far at least, the endgame is turning out better than the Fed or nearly anyone could have imagined at the start of the year. While the Fed won't rush into cutting rates, it's likely now just a matter of time.""Inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, fell 0.1% last month, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. That was the first monthly decline in the PCE price index since April 2020 and followed an unchanged reading in October.Food prices edged down 0.1% and energy prices dropped 2.7%. In the 12 months through November, the PCE price index increased 2.6% after rising 2.9% in October. October marked the first time since March 2021 that the annual PCE price index was below 3%.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PCE price index unchanged on the month and rising 2.8% year-on-year.Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.1% in November, matching October's gain.The so-called core PCE price index advanced 3.2% year-on-year, the smallest rise since April 2021, after increasing 3.4% in October. The Fed tracks the PCE price measures for its 2% inflation target.The government reported on Thursday that core PCE inflation increased at a 2.0% annualized rate in the third quarter. That, combined with November's mild gain, put the six-month core PCE inflation rate at 1.9%.Monthly inflation readings of 0.2% on a sustainable basis are needed to bring inflation back to the Fed's target, economists say. Financial markets saw a roughly 75% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's March 19-20 policy meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.Subsiding inflation is brightening the mood for many Americans, with a separate report from the University of Michigan on Friday showing consumer sentiment soaring in December, reversing all declines from the previous four months.President Joe Biden, whose popularity has been hurt by unhappiness over the high cost of living, welcomed the news.""This reflects the hard work we did together to fix our supply chains and the surge of Americans into the workforce. It's remarkable progress,"" Biden said in a statement.Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. The dollar fell against basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose.CONSUMER SPENDING RISESThe U.S. central bank held rates steady last week and policymakers signaled in new economic projections that the historic monetary policy tightening engineered over the last two years is at an end and lower borrowing costs are coming in 2024. Since March 2022, the Fed has hiked its policy rate by 525 basis points to the current 5.25%-5.50% range.With the labor market still fairly tight, wages jumped 0.6% last month, more than offsetting the drag on personal income from decreases in government aid, including food stamps, social security and Medicaid. Personal income rose 0.4%.The saving rate ticked up to 4.1% from 4.0% in the prior month, which bodes well for spending.Income at the disposal of households after accounting for inflation and taxes rose 0.4% after gaining 0.3% in October.That allowed Americans to open their wallets at the start of the holiday shopping season. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.2% last month after rising 0.1% in October.When adjusted for inflation, overall consumer spending increased 0.3% after nudging up 0.1% in October. The pick up in the so-called real consumer spending added to data this week, including single-family housing starts and building permits, in suggesting the economy was regaining speed after appearing to falter at the start of the fourth quarter.That was reinforced by a third report from the Commerce Department's Census Bureau showing orders for durable goods jumped 5.4% in November, recouping October's 5.1% drop.Though a fourth report from the Census Bureau showed new home sales plunging 12.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 590,000 units in November, a one-year low, the drop is likely temporary amid a dearth of previously owned houses on the market. Mortgage rates continue to decline from 23-year highs, which should help new home sales.Gross domestic product growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1.1% annualized rate to as high as a 2.8% pace. The economy grew at a 4.9% rate in the third quarter.""The U.S. economy is doing well heading into 2024,"" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ""No recession in 2024."""

Meanwhile, expenditure of Indian students going abroad is on the rise and is expected cross USD 70 billion annually by 2025, according to estimates.","Weekly Numerics is a column that features three to five charts based on major events or interesting data points that emerged during the week. Here are some of the key figures of the past seven days.Record-breaking suspensionsAs the winter session of parliament was adjourned sine die a day ahead of schedule, the total number of MPs suspended stood at 206, the highest number of MPs ever suspended in India.One hundred and forty six MPs were suspended in this winter session alone because of ‘unruly conduct’ following opposition protests demanding a statement from Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the security breach in parliament on December 13.With almost 20 percent of the MPs suspended, the ruling BJP took the opportunity to pass several important legislations in parliament, such as the three bills replacing the Indian Penal Code, and the Telecom bill. In fact, the parliament passed a total of 17 bills, 10 of which were introduced this session, along with seven pending from previous sessions, and no bills were referred to parliamentary committees. According to PRS Legislative Research, the proportion of bills referred to committees has decreased from 71 percent during the 15th Lok Sabha, to 16 percent during the current 17th Lok Sabha.Number of Indian students going abroad and their expendituresThe number of Indian students going abroad for education is estimated to rise from 11.8 lakh in 2022 to around 15 lakh in 2025. Their expenditure is expected to rise from nearly $50 billion to more than $70 billion during this period, according to a recent report published by University Living, a student housing marketplace, and One Step Global, a business strategy firm focused on the education sector.According to the report, the majority of students from India studying abroad are concentrated in just four countries, USA, UK, Australia, and Canada, and contribute significantly to their economies. “We estimated that almost 8.5 lakh students are pursuing their higher education abroad in just four countries — US, UK, Australia and Canada — spending close to $34 bn in 2023,” said the report.As much as 60 percent of Indian students studying abroad are pursuing a master’s degree. Meanwhile, state-wise data shows that Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, and Haryana had the highest number of students studying abroad, accounting for 12.5 percent of the total.Festive cheer lifts credit demandDemand for bank credit saw increased in the festive season this October. According to data sourced from CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy), credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks went up by Rs 2.8 trillion (lakh crore) during the month. This is significantly higher than the average increase of Rs 1.5 trillion during April-September 2023.The boost in credit was largely driven by demand from the services sector and personal (including housing) loans, followed by industry and agriculture.Bank credit to the services sector surged by Rs 1.81 trillion in October, significantly exceeding the average monthly increase of Rs 0.3 trillion from April to September 2023. The demand within the services sector was largely from the wholesale trade and NBFCs (non-banking financial companies).Personal loans, meanwhile, shot up by a record Rs 1.76 trillion during the month, driven by considerable increase in demand for housing loans, vehicle and other personal loans, and credit card outstandings, surpassing the average monthly increase of Rs 0.3 trillion from April to September, 2023.According to the RBI’s (Reserve Bank of India) June 2023 Financial Stability Report (FSR), the proportion of unsecured loans in overall retail loans rose from 22.9 percent to 25.2 percent between March 2021 and March 2023. Although unsecured personal loans only account for around 8 percent of total non-food bank credit, it’s a significant number compared to bank NPAs (non-performing assets), which are expected to drop to 3.5 percent by the end of this fiscal.This prompted the RBI to tighten capital norms in November. The new norms, which especially affect consumer loans, could result in increased borrowing costs. Moreover, reports suggesting rising delinquencies in small personal loans and in loans obtained in partnership with fintech firms, have led the banks to limit such offerings to curb the rise in unsecured personal loans."

The government has embarked on a challenging Rs 1 lakh crore programme for creating storage facilities in every block of the country,"The government’s ambitious grain storage programme, which is vital in achieving doubling farm income targets, is expected to see higher allocation in the Union Budget for 2024.India looks to increase grain storage capacity to 215 million tonnes from the current 145 million tonnes.  The government has embarked on a challenging Rs 1 lakh crore programme for creating storage facilities in every block of the country.New storage facilities need to come up at a faster pace to meet the food security targets of the country with a population of more than 140 crore people.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget for FY 2023-24 revealed a plan to set up massive decentralised storage capacity.  Sitharaman in her speech mentioned that the facilities will help farmers store their produce and get remunerative prices through sale at appropriate times.The agriculture sector also received a higher capital outlay of over Rs 1.25 lakh crore in the budget for 2023-24, which was up 5 percent compared to the revised estimates (RE) of 2022-23.Of this, Rs 1,15,532 crore were allocated for farmers' welfare, up by 5 percent over the RE 2022-23, to finance schemes like PM Kisan, interest subsidy and Fasal Bima schemes.Sitharaman also laid stress on strengthening the cooperative sector and setting up new multipurpose societies in uncovered village areas for farmer’s welfare.  A fund of Rs 2,516 crore was announced for the computerisation of 63,000 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS).The government has also chosen PACS as the primary vehicle for the creation of new storage facilities and taking the pressure off from Food Corporation of India and state warehousing corporations.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May this year unveiled a mega Rs 1 lakh crore scheme to create the world’s largest grain storage capacity in India through the cooperative sector.The scheme proposed the management of food godowns and silos by primary agricultural credit societies or PACS. Under the plan, storage facilities will be set up in every block of the country with a capacity of 500-2000 tonnes. A pilot project in 10 districts was proposed to be launched initially, which would be scaled up across the country later.Food security is also important for keeping consumer prices of farm products under check. Retail prices of various agri products have seen a sharp rise due to various seasonal factors like untimely rains, supply constraints or global factors.A robust network of storage facilities would ensure the supply of products throughout the year, keeping prices under check.Grain storage warehouses would also aid in reducing post-harvest losses which are estimated at up to 40 percent in the case of India. Cutting down such losses would increase food availability as well as overall crop yields in a season."

Growth has been resilient and continuously surprising on the upside.""It is important to note that for the first time in Q2:2023-24, the fault lines in India's growth story since the pandemic ""tepid private investment and rural demand  seem to be gaining traction,"" he said.Ranjan also stressed that the best way monetary policy can support this high growth trajectory is by maintaining its commitment to price stability.The three government-appointed members on MPC — Shashanka Bhide, Ashima Goyal and Jayanth R Varma — too had voted for keeping the rate unchanged. The repo rate has remained at 6.5 per cent since April.According to the minutes, Bhide said given that inflation remains well above the target over the short term, with the projected headline CPI rate of above 5 per cent up to Q1: 2024-25, there is a need to continue the policy support for sustaining the trajectory to the target.Goyal opined that if inflation sustainably approaches 4 per cent by the middle of 2024 real rates can easily become too high if nothing is done.""A repo of 6.5 per cent in 2018 and tight liquidity with headline inflation of around 4 per cent, even though core inflation was around 6 per cent, proved severely deflationary. Both headline and core inflation fell steeply over the next year,"" she said.MPC member Varma noted that current indications are that, after many difficult quarters, the economic environment is turning more benign in terms of both inflation and growth.The challenge for monetary policy is to facilitate this benign outcome where inflation trends down and growth remains robust, he said.The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled for February 6-8, 2024.

The inflation rate on pulses was recorded at 20 percent in November, according to data available from the Statistics Ministry.High food inflation has been a key concern for the government. The Centre has already extended its free grain distribution programme, PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, by five years to 2028, providing 5 kg of grains monthly to impoverished households.Additionally, it has taken various administrative steps to stabilize the prices of essential items like sugar, rice, pulses, vegetables, and edible oils.Even though masur dal has shown no inflation, with retail costs down by 1.4 percent on the year and 0.97 percent month on month, as per data provided by the Consumer Affairs Ministry, the government, as per a senior government official, has taken the step ""to bring down overall prices of pulses as the prices move in tandem for all of them together.""""We are focusing on bringing down prices of all pulses, especially tur. If the availability of other pulses increases, inflation in tur will go down too,"" the official said.Tur prices have remained high in the past year due to a shortfall in domestic production. However, the government’s measures have started taking effect, and prices of tur fell to Rs 154 per kg on December 18 from Rs 156.5 a month ago.The government on December 8 also exempted yellow peas (tur) from import duties until the end of this financial year, removing minimum import prices and port restrictions to facilitate trade.Anticipating a shortfall in the current year due to erratic weather, the Centre in January extended the duty-free import policy for tur & urad until March 31, 2024.Additionally, the government on June 2 allowed traders to keep only limited stocks of tur and urad. Following this step, the government released tur from the national buffer stocks to arrest the price rise.The government launched chana dal under the packaging of ‘Bharat Dal’ at subsidized prices of Rs 60 per kg throughout the country, intending to shift consumption for those who cannot afford expensive arhar or tur dal."

The personal consumption expenditures price index is now expected to rise an average 2.3% in 2024, compared with the 2.5% predicted last month, the survey showed.Forecasters see the economy growing at a strong pace through 2025 in the back of resilient consumer spending and private investment. Combined with more upbeat labor market projections, that suggests economists are confident the Fed could successfully pull off a so-called soft landing — when inflation comes down without major job losses or economic slowdown."

This is the second double instalment of tax devolution to states for the year 2023-24, with the first coming in June.As usual, the state receiving the largest amount was Uttar Pradesh, accounting for Rs 13,089 crore of the Rs 72,961 crore transferred on December 22, followed by Bihar at Rs 7,338 crore. The division of funds among states is done on the basis of a variety of factors, including population.The central government releases tax devolution to states in 14 equal instalments every year. As such, this involves two months where the instalment is double the usual monthly amount. However, these double-instalment months normally come at the end of the financial year after the Centre has greater clarity on its finances.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Christmas cheer has certainly found its way into markets and the holiday season spending patterns. Those in India who don’t bring the Christmas tree at home are heading somewhere on holiday to see one. It is a time marked with travel and Indians are getting surprised by the fact that travelling within the country is far more expensive than perhaps heading to some overseas destinations. Our South-East Asian neighbours such as Vietnam -- even some African countries -- are wooing us with visa-free entries.But did you know that you have the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to thank for removing at least one worry off your list during foreign travel? That worry is the foreign exchange rate. Yes, banks overcharge for forex conversion and yes, there are cumbersome rules to be followed. But have a look at what the rupee to the dollar conversion rate is, chances are that it is close to what it was three months ago or even six months ago. You shelled out Rs 83 plus other charges to get your hands on the buck two months back, and the same price applies now, too.Rewind to 2022 when the rupee had a volatile episode, swinging on average 2-3 rupees against the US dollar. Probably your pre-booked cheap foreign tour looked expensive by the time you actually left!If you are an investor or a non-resident Indian, you appreciate a stable currency more than anyone in the world. The exchange rate does not eat into your returns or risk wiping off your capital. All thanks to the gatekeeper, RBI.But the central bank has come under fire for its intense interventions in the foreign exchange market. Looking at its own data for October, we now know that the RBI bought $36.7 billion and sold $37 billion in a single month. That is 17 percent of the market volume, the highest since 2012 and the most intense under the current governor, as Reuters captured it in this piece. The International Monetary Fund now calls our forex regime “stabilised management” and not a “floating” exchange rate. Of course, the RBI has protested vehemently. This is not the first time it has been called out. The US treasury department classified the RBI as a currency manipulator back in 2021.Should the RBI be vilified for its job? Are we a wannabe China with too tight a control on an instrument that should be determined by the market?  Our columnist Subir Roy has a take on the same. Do read.Protecting markets from the undue effect of external events is the cornerstone of any central banker’s job description and the RBI is no different. The IMF’s contention is based on a short period where multiple external events threatened markets globally. The RBI has merely done its job of reducing the impact of these on India’s economy. Indeed, the rupee has closely mirrored the fundamentals of the economy because of the heavy interventions of the central bank.Of course, there is an unhappy section of the market that bore the brunt of the interventions: forex traders. You cannot make money punting on something that is controlled! Traders believe that the RBI has gotten carried away in its bid to protect the market.To be sure, the grip of the RBI on foreign exchange has increased over time. The central bank now even intervenes in the offshore non-deliverable forward which is not even in its jurisdiction. It influences the currency futures market and has been dialling up its interference here.There are costs involved in intervening and too much of it can upset even monetary policy objectives. But the costs of volatility are much higher for a capital-starved country like India. A volatile exchange rate tends to shake investor confidence. History would be kind to the RBI on its foreign exchange policy. For now, let us be thankful that our holidays are free of exchange rate worries.Investing insights from our research teamS.

In fact, the commerce ministry is working on reviewing the scheme to ensure better utilisation across sectors.","India’s flagship Make-in-India campaign witnessed a soft launch in September 2014, just a few months after Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, after a thumping electoral victory by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that year.The government’s stated objective was to facilitate investment, foster innovation, enhance skill development, protect intellectual property and build best-in-class manufacturing infrastructure.Though the government has taken a series of measures to push for this reform agenda, the two most notable steps are the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme and the opening up of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in key sectors.In 2014, the government liberalised the FDI limit from 26 percent to 49 percent in the insurance sector. In September 2014, under the Make-in-India initiative, FDI policy for 25 sectors was liberalised further. In May 2020, the Centre increased the FDI limit in defence manufacturing under the automatic route from 49 percent to 74 percent. FDI permissions in Key sectorsAccording to the Centre, the Make-in-India initiative is based on four pillars – new processes to enhance 'ease-of-doing-business', development of new infrastructure, such as industrial corridors and smart cities, opening up of FDI to attract investment, and a shift in mindset to ensure that the government acts as a facilitator for the industry rather than as a regulator.The push towards this initiative continued during the second term of the present government as campaigns like Atmanirbhar Bharat followed.The verdict on the Make-in-India programme is a mixed one, with some saying it is too ambitious while India has made tall strides in sectors such as electronics and pharmaceuticals.Exports have been rising steadily over the last decade. Exports of electronic goods increased from Rs 39,978 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 1,09,797 crore in 2021-22. Indian pharma exports have grown 103 percent since 2013-14, from Rs 90,415 crore in 2013-14 to Rs 1,83,422 crore in 2021-22.However, some experts feel that India’s Make-in-India journey is yet to take off, with the country becoming a centre for assembly rather than manufacturing.There are others who say that India has made a strong start. For instance, Foxconn is likely to invest $1 billion in a mobile manufacturing plant in India, according to reports. With another Union Budget round the corner, Moneycontrol evaluates India’s manufacturing push and what the budget can include to build India’s manufacturing story.PLI schemeIn the Union Budget 2021-22, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced an outlay of Rs 1.97 lakh crore for PLI schemes, which currently covers 14 key sectors, ranging from electronic products to drones.The government had, in 2021, said that the minimum production in India as a result of the scheme is expected to be over $500 billion in five years.As of June 2023, 733 applications have been approved in 14 sectors, with expected investment of Rs 3.65 lakh crore, according to estimates from the government. Around 176 medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs) are among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as bulk drugs, medical devices, pharma, telecom, white goods, food processing, textiles and drones. PLI SCHEME OUTLAYWhile the PLI scheme has done wonders for a handful of sectors, including India’s electronic manufacturing, in many others, investments have been sluggish. In fact, the commerce ministry is working on reviewing the scheme to ensure better utilisation across sectors.According to recent media reports, the government is planning changes in the textiles, pharmaceuticals, drones, solar and food processing industries, which together form nearly a third of the PLI scheme.FDI rulesThe National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by the BJP, in its budget for 2014-15, announced the intent to promote FDI in sectors that could boost domestic manufacturing and job creation.Following this, then Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced several steps to boost foreign investment inflows into key sectors, including easing the composite cap on foreign exchange to a certain extent for defence and insurance sectors, and allowing manufacturing units to sell products through retail, including e-commerce platforms without any additional approval.The next big overhaul in this policy came in June 2016 that included FDI beyond 49 percent in defence under the approval route and 100 percent FDI for e-commerce in food products manufactured in India under the approval route.Since then, the incumbent government has further liberalised FDI rules in several sectors such as defence, oil refineries, telecom, aviation, among others.According to estimates from Invest India, total FDI inflows into the country in the last 23 years (April 2000 - September 2023) stood at $953.143 billion, of which those in the last nine years (April 2014 - September 2023) amounted to nearly 65 percent.Way forwardIndia’s Make-in-India stride is expected to receive a further boost as major economies look to reduce their dependence on China and scout for alternative manufacturing hubs. In this context, New Delhi has seen interest from conglomerates including Tesla and Apple to set up shop within the country.The Budget for 2024-25 is likely to focus on ease-of-doing business, including decriminalisation of certain offences and labour laws, Moneycontrol reported citing sources on November 23 (give link).The World Bank’s Ease-of-Doing Business Survey, in which India’s ranking rose from 142 in 2015 to 63 in 2020, has been discontinued. India had been doing well in the global ranking with respect to ease-of-doing business for the past few years.Though India’s Make-in-India push via easier FDI norms and the PLI scheme has been acknowledged, there are concerns with regard to its sustenance.The recent global slowdown has started impacting FDI flows. Foreign direct equity investments into India fell by 24 percent on-year to $20.5 billion during the first six months of the current fiscal.Total FDI, including equity capital of unincorporated bodies, reinvest earnings and other capital, fell 15.5 percent during April to September and inflows decreased from key countries such as Singapore, Mauritius, US, and United Arab Emirates.Expert-speak“While there are a number of steps taken by the government, a further increase in the speed of creating infrastructure, including the logistics infrastructure, would support the manufacturing sector and the Make-in-India initiative. Currently, the PLI schemes are more focused on manufacturing output and less focused on research and innovation. While there is a separate research-based incentives scheme, the government may consider giving investment in research certain incentives under the PLI schemes itself,” Gunjan Prabhakaran, Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax, BDO India, told Moneycontrol.“In addition, it is seen that after the announcement of the scheme, the various recipient industries have been engaging with the government to iron out the practical issues, including the eligibility norms itself, which leads to the modification of the schemes. This results in delays. This delay can be reduced if the schemes are designed in consultation with the industry, with the government laying down specific parameters. Lastly, some of the sectors have seen significant delays in the disbursement of incentives, which need to be addressed on a sector-specific basis as well as on conceptual level itself,” she said.“The PLI schemes boost the Make-in-India initiative. The success of the two PLI schemes in pharma is getting reflected in declining imports. The pharma and medical devices industry proved its mettle during COVID-19. We served the domestic needs and exported as well. Under Vaccine Maitri, we supplied vaccines to around 96 countries,” Ashok Madan, ED, Indian Drug Manufacturers' Association (IDMA), told Moneycontrol.Many, including former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, has questioned the efficacy of the output-linked incentive plan. Rajan, in a note back in May 2022/2023, had said that the rise in exports of finished cell phones cannot be attributed to the country’s manufacturing prowess since manufacturers were most likely engaging in assembly alone.Recently, former chief economic advisor to the government and current NITI Aayog member Arvind Virmani, in an interview to Moneycontrol, said that the government needs to identify the problems associated with the PLI scheme before expanding it further.“If we want to extend PLI, we may have to identify problems in specific sectors and address them. Similarly, we may analyse whether the current structure of the PLI scheme is good only for electronics or works for other sectors, too,” he said on November 14."

And while politics plays its role, the power the Centre exerts over the availability and sharing of monetary resources is also a considerable factor.","Earlier this week, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked for New Delhi to release pending funds to the state. According to Banerjee, the Centre owes over Rs 1 lakh crore funding to West Bengal for centrally sponsored schemes and money related to natural disaster claims.For instance, the Union government has not given funds to West Bengal under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme since March 2022. This, the Centre has said, is because the state has not complied with its directions to implement the scheme transparently, once again putting the spotlight on the fractious relationship between the Centre and the state over finances.Falling control over own finances?First things first: expenditure by states is greater than the Centre's. Take the current year, where the Centre is budgeted to spend Rs 45.03 lakh crore and states collectively have a spending target of Rs 50.22 lakh crore. The states' budgeted capital expenditure, at Rs 8.85 lakh crore for 2023-24, is higher than the Centre's Rs 8.37 lakh crore, after adjusting for the loans component of its capex.Also Read: India must lower fiscal deficit 'a lot more' to get higher rating, says S&PSecond, spending by states is known to have a greater impact on the economy. As per a 2013 paper by RBI economists, a 1 percent increase in revenue expenditure by states is estimated to result in a 0.6 percent increase in GDP, while a similar increase by the Centre raises the GDP by about 0.2 percent. The size of these 'multipliers' is even larger when it comes to capex: 2.1 for states and 0.4 for the Centre.The problem, however, lies in the dynamics of states' revenue and expenditure. On the expenditure side, states are competing with each other to improve their infrastructure base so that they can attract private and overseas investments and create jobs. In this, the Centre has even offered its assistance by starting a scheme under which it provides long-term, interest-free loans to states for capex. The allocation for this scheme was increased by 30 percent in 2023-24 to Rs 1.3 lakh crore.On the other hand, states have alleged the control they have over their own revenues has been reducing, with the rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 further lowering their ability to tinker with tax rates and increase revenues.That indirect tax revenue under GST is rising, even for states, cannot be denied. But the growth in GST revenue has not been uniform. Following the end of the GST compensation period in June 2022, certain states—especially mineral-rich ones such as Chhattisgarh—have felt the brunt of the new indirect tax regime being a destination-based system. And the government has admitted as much.""I don't see how we can come up with something specifically targeted at them (states disadvantaged by GST being destination-based) – unless the Finance Commission looks at it and changes the devolution formula and gives them something additional,"" Vivek Johri, former chairman of the Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs, had told Moneycontrol in July.The feeling of reduced control on their own tax revenue is also why states are widely considered to be opposed to the inclusion of fuel products such as petrol and diesel under GST. But this is a double-edged sword, with the Union government repeatedly calling on them to cut local taxes on petrol and diesel to bring down pump prices.Own revenues and borrowingsContrary to the above, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pointed out in its recently published study of state finances that states' own tax revenue as a percentage of their overall tax revenue has gone up in recent years to 65.4 percent on average from 62.8 percent just prior to the rollout of GST, indicating that states' dependence on tax devolution from the Centre has reduced slightly since GST was introduced.Sources of tax revenue that states still control, apart from fuel, include stamp duty, land registration fees, excise duty on liquor, and motor vehicle tax.Also Read: Post GST compensation, states fall back on land and liquor to shore up revenuesStates that have seen the largest increase in the share of their own tax revenue in overall tax revenue after the introduction of GST include Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Odisha. Meanwhile, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Goa, and Gujarat have seen their own tax revenue form a smaller portion of their overall tax revenue.""However, while the RBI report claims that states' reliance on devolution from the Centre has decreased post-GST, a comparison with a longer period pre-GST shows that this is not the case,"" economists Madhavi Arora and Harshal Patel of Emkay Global Financial Services noted. Source: Emkay Global Financial ServicesAccording to Arora and Patel, states' own tax revenue ""has flat-lined as a percentage of GSDP (gross state domestic product), while it has failed to reach pre-GST levels as a share of total tax revenue"".The RBI report also said states have plenty of scope to increase their non-tax revenue by regularly revising charges on public services such as electricity and water and royalties from mining, among others. But the first of these is next to impossible for any political party that wants to return to power at the legislative assembly level.If revenue does not rise to meet new expenditure, governments can always increase their borrowing from the market. Well, at least the Centre can, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic. States, however, cannot borrow and spend freely as their borrowing limit is capped by the government, with their fiscal deficit threshold kept at 3 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the Centre is still nowhere close to bringing its own deficit down to 3 percent, something that was to be achieved in 2006-07.Also Read: Moving the goalposts — fiscal deficit target and a 20-year delayThe Union government is targeting a fiscal deficit of 5.9 percent for 2023-24 on its way to reducing it to 4.5 percent by 2025-26, as per the revised fiscal consolidation roadmap.That states' borrowing limit is a sticking point can be gleaned from the fact that the finance minister has already been asked seven questions on the issue in the ongoing Winter Session of Parliament by MPs such as NK Premachandran and John Brittas.Cesses and surchargesIn addition to an unlimited borrowing capacity, which, of course, must be used judiciously, the central government also has access to a pool of resources that it does not have to share with states: cesses and surcharges. And this pool has grown sharply in recent years, much to the consternation of states.Currently, states get 41 percent of the shareable Union taxes, down from the 42 percent recommended by the 14th Finance Commission following the division of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. This, for 2023-24, amounts to Rs 10.21 lakh crore that must be transferred to states this year, with the finance ministry on December 22 saying it had released an additional instalment of Rs 72,961 crore as tax devolution following a similar transfer earlier this month on December 11.However, cesses and surcharges—such as the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess, Road and Infrastructure Cess, and Health and Education Cess—are not part of this divisible pool of resources and are for the exclusive use of the Centre. And this pile of money has grown rapidly to 17.7 percent of the Centre's gross tax revenue in 2021-22 from just 6.4 percent in 2011-12.The net result of the proliferation of the Centre's cesses and surcharges is that the actual tax devolution to states has been lower than what successive Finance Commissions have recommended. Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaAs per the aforementioned RBI report, the pool of Union taxes to be divided among states has fallen to 78.9 percent of gross tax revenue in 2021-22 from 88.6 percent in 2011-12. This is despite the 14th Finance Commission recommending an increase in the tax devolution to 42 percent from 32 percent, effective April 2015.If India is to become a developed country by 2047, all levels of government need to work together. And as the name suggests, co-operative federalism requires some give and take; the Centre will have to address valid concerns of the states, which must become more efficient and find new sources of revenue."

Meanwhile, evidence of demand-driven inflation, a by-product of strong domestic spending and wage gains, remains preciously scarce,"" said Jeemin Bang, an associate economist at Moody's Analytics.""Our baseline is for the BOJ to drop negative interest rates in 2024, but we expect the central bank will maintain some level of support given the economy's weak state.""The core consumer price index (CPI), which excludes volatile fresh food but includes fuel costs, rose 2.5% in November from a year earlier, matching market forecasts and slowing from a 2.9% gain in October. It was the slowest pace of rise since a 2.4% growth marked in July 2022.A breakdown showed goods prices rose 3.3% in November from a year earlier, slower than a 4.4% gain in October, due to falling fuel costs and moderating hikes for food.But services inflation accelerated to 2.3% in November from 2.1% in the previous month, underscoring the BOJ's view that prospects of higher wages are prodding some firms to pass on rising labour costs.""We expect companies to keep raising service prices, though there's no change to our view that overall inflation will slow as a trend,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""The BOJ probably won't normalise policy for the time being.""Japan has seen inflation hold above 2% since April last year and some firms have signalled their readiness to keep raising wages, increasing the chance the BOJ will finally abandon its status as a dovish outlier among global central banks.But the BOJ kept ultra-loose policy intact on Tuesday and Governor Kazuo Ueda left no hints of an early exit, stressing that the bank needed to continue scrutinising whether a positive wage-inflation cycle will fall in place.Minutes of the BOJ's October meeting, released on Friday, showed board members remaining divided on how soon Japan can see conditions for an exit fall in place.More than 80% of economists polled by Reuters in November expect the BOJ to end its negative rate policy next year with half of them predicting April as the most likely timing. Some see the chance of a policy shift in January."

The enormous degree of opaqueness in the methodology makes it challenging to quantify the impact of qualitative factors on credit ratings. The significant presence of qualitative factors in credit rating methodologies also gives rise to bandwagon effects and cognitive biases amply reflected in various studies, generating concerns about the credibility of credit ratings,” a document titled ‘Re-examining Narratives: A Collection of Essays’ published by the office of Chief Economic Adviser said.The contents of the publication do not necessarily reflect the views of the government or any of its ministries and departments.The three rating agencies fail to clearly distinguish between the indicators used to assess ‘ability to pay’ and ‘willingness to pay’, making it complicated to evaluate the assigned credit ratings, it said.The economists say that enhanced transparency is needed in the methodologies adopted by these CRAs, which will lead to credit rating upgradation for a number of countries saving them billions in funding costs.FitchThe methodologies used by credit rating agencies are opaque and appear to disadvantage developing economies in certain ways. Fitch tends to ignore the welfare and development functions that public sector banks tend to play in a developing country, where government-owned banks have played an important role in promoting financial inclusion, it said.“Reading through the methodology documents of the big three agencies, one would find that the descriptions and justifications for several parameters included in the methodology are not obvious. For instance, the Fitch document mentions that the rating agency “takes comfort from high levels of foreign ownership” in the banking sector and that “public-owned banks have historically been subject to political interference.” Such an assessment tends to discriminate against developing countries, where the banking sector is primarily run by the public sector,” the article said.In contrast, the expansion of foreign owned banks in a developing country seems to target the already-banked middle class and does not appear to serve the unbanked low-income households.Second, the experts generally consulted for the rating assessments are selected in a non-transparent manner, adding another layer of opaqueness to an already difficult-to-interpret methodology. Lastly, the rating agencies do not convey clearly the assigned weights for each parameter considered. While Fitch does lay out some numerical weights for each parameter, they do go on to state that the weights are for illustrative purposes only. Thus, it is left to the reader to make educated guesses on what the assigned weights could be for the qualitative and the quantitative factors, it read.Moody'sIn the case of Moody’s, the finance ministry’s economists pointed out the opaqueness underlying the dynamic weights and its application to arrive at the rating outcomes. “Fitch mentions that weights used in their model are only for illustrative purposes.”S&PS&P combines the flexibility and performance profile with the institutional and economic profile to determine an ""indicative rating level"". The agency, for some assessment scores, gives higher weightage to flexibility and performance profiles compared to institutional and economic profiles and equal weightage otherwise. This adds to the lack of methodological clarity, the article said.Reforms in credit rating processEnhanced transparency in credit rating may compel the use of hard data and likely result in credit rating upgrades for a good number of sovereigns. This will help them access private capital, which has been assigned the central role by G-20 in addressing global challenges such as climate change and supporting the energy transition. Reforming the sovereign rating process will correctly reflect the default risk of developing economies, saving them billions in funding costs, the article read.“As the rated sovereign is obligated to be completely transparent, establishing symmetry of obligations warrants that the rating agencies make their processes transparent and avoid employing untenable judgements,” it said."

In 2015, he predicted a 1930s-style Great Depression. None of these came true. Perhaps his luck ran out","Abhishek Banerjee & Karuna GopalIt was one morning in December 2022. The two men sat side by side, under the winter sun. India will be “lucky to get 5 percent growth” next year, Raghuram Rajan told Rahul Gandhi. The next day it was all over the newspapers. Coming from Rajan, it was already as good as true. But this was not the first time that the media had taken either of these two individuals more seriously than it should have. ‘If Rajan exits, so will billions in investment’ ran one headline in 2016. That was when his term as governor of the Reserve Bank was about to end. Rajan also made headlines in June 2015 when he predicted that a 1930s-style Great Depression was coming. What happened to that?From 2013 to 2018, Rajan “predicted” doom for the global economy at the rough rate of once a year. Each time, the media covered him. The media never learns. But this time, something new happened. Something that rarely happens to star economists. People followed up. They made clippings of his “lucky to get 5 percent” speech and began posting it online. Every time India posted its high growth numbers, the videos went viral. A dazzling 7.8 percent in the first quarter of the 2023-24 fiscal year, and 7.6 percent for the second.The world is cheering on India. And people online are laughing at Raghuram Rajan.And so, it is for the first time ever, that a cornered Rajan has been forced to defend himself. In recent interviews, he said that all these people are trolls. He says it is an organised effort against him. But it is not. It is just common people speaking truth to an economist they now see as more political than academic. For that matter, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, during which Rajan originally made these comments, was also an organised effort. The question is whether the critics are wrong, not whether they are organised.So here are five ways in which we believe that Raghuram Rajan is wrong about India’s economic path.1. India is not growing faster simply because we are a poor countryThat was the first defence from Rajan, in an interview he gave to The Wire. “We are growing faster than other large economies…Poor countries grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. There is so much more to do, and we know what to do,” he said.First of all, when Rajan made his prediction in December last year, did he not know that India is a poor country?Second, note the obvious flaw in the argument. If India is poor now, it was even poorer during the UPA years. Why then was India the slowest growing BRIC economy between 2004 and 2014? Between 2004 and 2014, China expanded its GDP by an astonishing 430 percent, Brazil by 266 percent, and Russia by 222 percent. In contrast, India could only manage 181 percent. In fact, Indonesia increased its GDP by 219 percent. No wonder that by the end of UPA’s term, there were calls for Indonesia to replace India as the “I” in BRIC!Here is another way to look at this. When the UPA decade began in 2004, India’s GDP was about 37 percent that of China. By 2014, it had been reduced to just 19 percent. In other words, India’s economic size relative to China had been cut in half. The lesson is that poor countries do not magically grow faster. You need a good policy.Read : Raghuram Rajan's new book on future of Indian economy set for December release2. India has grown due to its own strength, not just because of global factors“We have been lucky,” Rajan explained in another interview. He added that after he made his “lucky to get 5 percent growth” comment, it was not just India but the whole world that grew faster than he expected. But India’s growth was ahead of the rest of the world. Since 2014, India’s GDP has increased by 83 percent. This is well ahead of China at 68 percent, and the United States at 53 percent. Most European countries have been under 10 percent. India’s peers in BRIC, such as Brazil and Russia have actually seen their GDP contract significantly by 10-14 percent. As for Indonesia, it grew 59 percent, well behind India’s 83 percent. There is no longer any danger of Indonesia replacing India in BRIC.So India went from being the slowest growing BRIC economy in the UPA years to the fastest growing since 2014. Why deny credit to India and the current Indian government? But let us come back to the comment that Rajan made about “luck.” Not just India, but the whole world grew faster than he predicted. So he was wrong not just about India, but the entire world economy. How is that supposed to be an excuse? And why does he blame his failure on “luck?”Remember that Rajan is most famous for having “predicted” the 2008 crisis back in 2005. Was that success due to “luck” as well? Worse, we should go beyond the media myths and ask if Rajan actually predicted that 2008 crisis. You see, predictions are supposed to contain specifics. Like when Rajan said that in the 2023-24 fiscal, India’s growth would be under 5 percent. So there was a date and a number against which the success or failure of his prediction could be measured. But his words in 2005 contained no specifics. He merely said that something might go wrong at some point in the future.But that was always going to happen. Every decade has at least one big economic crisis. There is always going to be another plane crash, or another earthquake, flood or drought someday. This is not a prediction. This is called stating the obvious. Since then, Rajan has predicted many more recessions, including in 2015 when he predicted a 1930s-style Great Depression. None of these came true. Perhaps his luck ran out.3. India has the potential to become a manufacturing superpowerDo iPhones that are made in India smell of curry? The allegations are all over Chinese social media. Yes, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is beginning to panic, now that more and more Apple merchandise is being made in India. Or shall we say “assembled” in India? After all, we would not like to hurt the feelings of domestic critics who seem no less nervous than the Chinese.What an amazing lack of vision these critics have shown! In the second quarter of 2022, Apple accounted for just 9 percent of smartphone exports from India. In the same quarter of 2023, it is more like 49 percent. This fiscal year, Apple is set to overshoot its export targets under the PLI scheme by a huge margin. Over the next five years, they are likely to raise production from $7 billion worth to over $40 billion. India is beginning to put together the basics for a manufacturing revolution. The expressways, the railway freight corridors, the seaports and waterways are being put together.How can someone bet India’s future, as Rajan suggests, purely on services? Especially with so much of the global supply chain in the hands of China. Did we learn nothing from the pandemic? For example, Apple’s supplier Foxconn is the 10th largest employer worldwide, just behind the Indian Railways. Who would not want them here? And yes, we also need to get into the new race for semiconductor chip manufacturing. This is an economic necessity and even a national security issue.But over the last year or so, Rajan has made a name for himself as a savage critic of India’s manufacturing prospects. Clearly, he does not understand that India has a history of starting from humble origins and making it big. From steel to cars to satellites. Back in the day, British officer Upcott had joked that he would eat every pound of steel if Indians could make any. Today, India is the second-largest producer of steel in the world.4. India has managed to balance both stimulus and inflation fears perfectlyThe patient is on a sickbed and needs a tonic immediately. So said Raghuram Rajan in his 2020 blog, as he made his case for a huge fiscal stimulus during the pandemic. One that India possibly could not afford. And one which would likely lead to runaway inflation. The support from the government, primarily in the form of foodgrains, was “meagre,” he had said. But look at what happened next. India bounced back sharply and posted world-beating growth numbers in 2021, 2022 and now 2023. All this while inflation stayed around 5-6 percent and the Rupee was stable. Now the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects India to remain the fastest-growing economy at least until 2028.Also Read: Economists, policymakers spar over India's growth narrative ahead of national electionAnd look at what happened in the West. They handed out massive stimulus packages. But it all backfired, producing low growth and high inflation. They got a small bounce in growth figures for 2021. But it quickly went downhill after that. Most Western economies slipped back to 2-3 percent growth, while inflation soared to 9-11 percent. The US itself saw two successive quarters of negative growth in 2022. This used to be the technical definition of a recession, before “economists” changed it in 2022 to suit midterm election prospects for President Biden’s party.On his part, Raghuram Rajan has done an about-turn as well. He now blames central banks in the West for not being careful while giving out big stimulus packages. Anyone who remembers what Rajan himself said in 2020 must be a “troll.”5. India does not need authoritarians; democracy has served India much betterPerhaps the most puzzling comment comes from Rajan’s recent book with Rohit Lambda. “India may have democratized too early. Perhaps strong manufacturing growth in its early years required an authoritarian hand to remove the obstacles in the way of development,” they write. Rajan doubled down on these comments in his interview with Karan Thapar. He pointed, as people often do, to the authoritarian leaders who created economic miracles in East Asia. But Rajan ignores the facts about Indian history. Can authoritarian leaders sometimes serve the economic interests of a nation better? Yes, it is true, even if it is an uncomfortable truth. But it really depends on which authoritarian. An authoritarian leader like Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore? Yes. But an authoritarian leader like Indira Gandhi? No. Having an authoritarian leader is not a guarantee of economic prosperity.In fact, how different was India from an authoritarian state between 1950 and 1991? There was practically a Congress monopoly. Leadership in the party was passed down by the principle of hereditary succession. Non-Congress governments could technically be elected in states. But these were often dismissed in bulk. During this time, India went from the sixth-largest economy in 1950 to the twelfth-largest in 1991. In 1950, India’s per capita GDP was 18 percent of the world average. By 1991, it had come down to 6 percent. So the average Indian became roughly three times poorer between 1950 and 1991. So much for the advantages of authoritarianism. The Congress monopoly was shattered in 1991. Since then, India has become a lot more democratic. And India has done better in every way.Also read: Raghuram Rajan says economic achievements, not nationalism, must reunite IndiaOne final note from history that everyone deserves to know. One that Raghuram Rajan should keep in mind before he begins this dangerous talk about authoritarianism in India. In the 1950s and 60s, the US government brought over a group of economists from Chile and trained them at the University of Chicago. These people came to be known as the ‘Chicago Boys’. The Chicago Boys formed the core of Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship after the CIA-led coup overthrew the elected government of Chile and installed a puppet regime in 1973. As a Chicago economist himself, Rajan would surely be aware of this story. And we would advise him to choose his words more carefully when talking about authoritarianism.Abhishek Banerjee (@AbhishBanerj on “X”) is an author and columnist; Karuna Gopal (@KarunaGopal1 on “X”) is president, Foundation for Futuristic Cities.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. After the manner in which Indian equities nosedived on Wednesday to spook investors, today’s recovery with the Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex back in the green (around noon), brings some relief.True, there is no concrete reason explaining yesterday’s steep fall that wiped off Rs 9 lakh crore from market capitalisation in a single trading session. From fears of COVID raising its head again as the number of cases surges in India to simple profit-booking to squaring off trades before the year-end, investors were looking for reasons to explain the fall.However, what’s certain is that the correction warrants some caution. Note that even after yesterday’s drop, the benchmarks are still up 17-18 per cent since January. Mid-caps have gained about 30 percent with many stocks doubling in the year 2023!But this is precisely why it may be time to do a quality check on your portfolio. 2023 was too perfect a year and this adds tinge of worry about the way forward, explains investment adviser Shyam Sekhar, in this exclusive article in MCPro on markets. At this point, all the positives are built into stock prices and valuations, with even the Nifty 50 trading at the historic average of 20 times one-year forward estimated earnings.On the flip side, this could also imply that valuations are stretched and leave no room for upsides, unless earnings rally faster than forecasts. Meanwhile, any negative news could trigger a huge correction as was seen on Wednesday.Technically too, the charts forecast fragility ahead, says my colleagueShishir Asthana in this article.  He points out that the 21000 level for the Nifty index level is critical; a break below that, we see minor supports at 20,800 and 20,500, but the next stronger level is at 20,200.That said, the markets are usually in a holiday mood between Christmas and the New Year, often lacklustre for market traders. Pointing to a trend noticed since 2018, this article says Nifty Smallcap and BSE Smallcap indices see a sharp selling in the week prior to Christmas as if the Ghost of Christmas Past plagues the indices.The message: Don’t sit complacent on the returns clocked in 2023. Instead, stay tuned to cues from the crucial general elections outcome and more importantly, inflation and employment data, private sector capital expenditure that must expand post-elections and sustained top-line growth driving corporate profits.Investing insights from our research teamInnova Captab IPO: A pricey contract manufacturerWhich wealth management firm’s stock is a worthy bet?Suryoday Small Finance Bank: Why this stock is for risk-takersMC Pro New Year Portfolio: These 17 stocks show promise for a rewarding 2024What else are we reading?RBI researchers warn against hasty rate cutsChart of the Day: MFIs up the game in credit growthAs RBI moves to sever lender-AIF link, SEBI must gun for more disclosuresAfter a most stable 2023 performance, rupee set to gain in 2024Premium-class flying is a monopoly of Tatas.

To address this, the government has banned the export of all non-basmati white rice in July 2023.It has also imposed a 20 percent duty on the export of parboiled rice, initially till October 2023, which was then extended to March 2024. This step, according to Additional Secretary of Commerce Ministry, Rajesh Aggarwal, has led to better realizations for basmati and parboiled.“We are noticing a growth of almost 20 percent in overseas sales of these categories of rice due to increased prices and higher volumes. This will help reduce overall rice export deficit to some extent,” he said.While sales of basmati rice rose 16 percent in April-October, up from $2.55 billion to $2.96 billion; exports of non-basmati rice fell 20 percent from $3.64 billion last year to $2.90 billion this year in the same period.Exports of wheat plunged more than 98 percent to $23 million in the April-October period from $1.51 billion last year.The government has also extended curbs on sugar which it placed in October 2022, restricting exports of raw, white and refined sugar, requiring exporters to secure permission from the food ministry to sell overseas. The restriction was to stay in place until further orders or October 2023, whichever was earlier. A new notification issued this October added organic sugar to the category and extended the curbs “till further orders” without specifying an end date, virtually banning sugar exports.Basmati rice exports may be impacted if attack on red sea shipments continuesBasmati rice exports could be affected if the attacks by Houthi rebels on ships passing through the Red Sea exports continues, another official said on condition of anonymity. India may need to explore longer routes, circumnavigating Africa, for exporting commodities such as Basmati rice.“While this may add about 15-20 percent of shipment costs, we do not expect higher prices of Indian basmati to deter demand. However, as of now, the industry has not voiced any concerns on shipments yet,” the official added."
564,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/suez-canal-crisis-could-this-impact-indias-earnings-story-11938001.html,Suez Canal crisis: Could this impact India's earnings story?,"December 22, 2023 07:04 PM IST","While a prolonged blockage of this vital trade route could impact company earnings, analysts said that it’s too early to gauge the full extent of the potential repercussions.","A prolonged blockage of the Suez Canal, one of the world’s most vital trade routes, could erode India Inc’s earnings as global freight costs may rise significantly and stoke inflation, analysts said.In a December 19 report, CNBC reported that cargo worth around $35 billion had been diverted, with around 57 cargo ships changing their route as major shipping corporations announced their decision to pause movements through the Suez Canal route after the recent attacks on ships passing through the area by Yemen-based Houthi rebels, backed by Iran.Potential impact on IndiaOne of the biggest impacts of the blockage of trade or use of alternative routes is usually an increase in freight rates as routes get longer and volumes reduce. While this is beneficial to shipping companies, increasing costs of transportation and delays in shipments could have larger implications.Also read: Shipping giants halt Suez Canal routes: Should you buy shipping stocks now?Varun Gogia, Assistant Vice President and Sector Head of Corporate Ratings at ICRA Ltd, explained that the overall logistics costs are bound to rise, which Indian exporters and importers may find difficult to pass on to end users.“The weak macroeconomic outlook further limits the ability to pass on the cost increases to end users. If the Red Sea conflict lingers on for a long time or the conflict escalates, it could stoke inflationary pressures and keep the cost of financing high in the near to medium term,” he says.To be sure, several analysts said that it would be too early to conclude whether it could potentially hit India’s earnings story.Markets have not seen any adverse impact yet because of this news. Only some shipping stocks saw immediate gains over the last two days. While there has been some volatility in Indian stocks, analysts say one cannot directly connect this to the ongoing crisis.Most experts would like to see price signals to decide which way to go. Thus, for the market, it seems to be signalling that the issue may not escalate for a longer period as stocks are still holding up.The sell-off we are seeing in smallcaps is not necessarily an indication of risks emanating from the Suez Canal blockage. It is thus better to wait and watch, experts said.Some experts, however, pointed out that investors are booking profits where they can. Several midcap and smallcap stocks where investors are sitting on significant profits are taking them off the table to protect them from a potential crack in the market that could stem from a larger risk-off trade if the crisis intensifies.If extended, the crisis could lead to challenges across the board, especially in segments that depend on cross-border trade, like the import of raw materials or even the export of finished products.“If the problem persists, the overall logistics cost will go up, especially if the logistics cost is a key part of the business. Then their profitability will get hit,” said Sneha Poddar, an analyst at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Also read: Suez Canal closure worries industry but government confident of minimal impact“Delays and rerouting can disrupt supply chains, and industries heavily dependent on imported raw materials and inputs may face increased costs. Just-in-time inventory systems, perishable goods, or those highly reliant on timely imports and time-sensitive production requirements of inputs could be most at risk, as could sectors heavily integrated into global value chains, potentially affecting employment and economic stability,” said Winnie Shekhar, Partner, Indus Law.Poddar added that, in the short term, it could mean that costs could be absorbed by shipping companies themselves, but in the long term, it could lead to price rises for consumers as well as challenges for the customers in fulfilling orders and a contraction in earnings.Some of the sectors that could be impacted include textiles, oil and gas, chemicals, some capital goods companies, metals, and pharma.“In the long term, it is a big negative for India because it has to depend a lot on imports. But currently, we don’t expect it to be a big issue for the Indian market on a medium- or short-term,” Vinod Nair of Geojit Financial Services says.The chemical sector, Gogia of ICRA said, remains significantly exposed to global markets and is already under pressure from Chinese dumping.The rise in freight costs, he says, may increase cost pressures as shipments take longer to reach end users. On the port side, container traffic, which had witnessed robust growth in the last seven months of FY2024, may witness headwinds due to longer travel times, leading to issues like container availability.Déjà vu 2021?The last time India was faced with a trade crisis arising out of the Suez Canal was in 2021, after a large container ship blocked the route for nearly a week.This incident, which came amidst an already-lingering global COVID crisis, saw countries around the world facing delays of over $10 billion per day. “This blockage had a huge economic impact on global players and significantly slowed down trade between Europe, Asia, and the Middle East (including India). The last 2021 blockage led to a hike in freight rates by 5-15 percent, largely increasing input and import costs, apart from causing massive delays and disruptions in the supply chains,” Shekhar explains.While India did notice a decline in GDP rates from 2021–2022, analysts say that there were larger global reasons behind the decline, such as the COVID pandemic in 2021 and the Russia-Ukraine war in early 2022. This quarter, India has reported a GDP of 7.6 percent, beating the RBI’s forecast of 6.5 percent.Nair is of the view that one cannot compare the possible impact of the current situation to any of the previous global crises, whether the Russia-Ukraine war or even the 2021 Suez Canal blockage.“From 2022 to 2023, due to the Russia-Ukraine war, there was a direct impact on commodities like wheat, but it is different this time and cannot be a like-to-like comparison,” he says.Additionally, Gogia explains that while there was a freight cost increase at that time, as the issue was resolved within a week’s time, it did not have a structural impact on the economy.“Most of the trade experiences in the past have been ephemeral in nature, like the sharp rise in freight rates, post-COVID, and the blockage of Suez in 2021, which impacted the economy for a short period of time; thereafter, as things normalised, the economic impact also waned,” he says."
565,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/online-gaming-companies-to-incentivise-players-to-park-deposits-for-longer-durations-to-balance-28-gst-hit-11937631.html,Online gaming companies to incentivise players to park deposits for longer durations to balance 28% GST hit,"December 21, 2023 12:33 PM IST","The gaming industry has been absorbing the higher GST without passing it on to customers, taking a hit to their margins. Gaming companies are also looking at other ways to lessen the impact of GST.","The online gaming industry, which is currently taking a hit on margins due to the 28 percent Goods and Services Tax (GST) in effect since October 1, is aiming to incentivise players to park their money on the platforms for a longer duration and change user behaviour over the next one year in order to reduce the impact on their net profitability, multiple industry players said.The GST Council has revised the rate on online gaming from 18 percent to 28 percent on full face value effective October 1, 2023.“It’s a sizable increase in the GST rate. The GST burden is hitting the EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. It is the alternate method of measuring profitability in net income.) positivity of companies. Over the next year the online gaming companies aim at changing user behaviour to keep deposits for longer to reduce the tax incidence. The EBITDA positivity depends on changes in user and transaction behaviour over the next one year,” an industry source told Moneycontrol.Every time a deposit is made by a player on an online gaming platform, 28 percent GST is payable on the face value. For taxation, the deposit duration is important, not the gaming time. If the same amount of money continues on a platform, the tax will be one time. In a month if a person withdraws and deposits three times, 28 percent GST is applicable every time a deposit is made, leading to a high tax incidence. Thus, if the user's behaviour is such that they keep money for long on an online gaming platform, the company gets more revenue for the tax paid.“The industry currently is absorbing the higher GST and not passing it on to the players. In the books of online gaming companies, it will reflect a huge hit. So, the companies may provide incentives or bonuses to users for parking their money for a long on the platform. There may be different operational ways, we will experiment with how to change user behaviour. Then the EBIDTA positivity will grow. Companies are already experimenting with it and the impact will be seen after a year,” another industry source told Moneycontrol.Additionally, the companies may also look to increase profitability by putting more money into advertisements and creating new users to keep the growth going, he said.The market size of the online gaming industry is estimated at $2.5 billion in FY24 which is expected to grow by 25 percent next fiscal. If the companies are able to change user behaviour over the next one year, the growth rate of 25 percent in the sector is likely to continue.“The higher GST will not show a significant impact on the topline. The ecosystem of online gaming, fantasy sports and card games are holding fort. In FY25, the growth in the industry is expected at 22-25 percent as free-to-play is also included. The number will not go down in terms of users till companies keep absorbing the GST burden. So the growth won’t show a slowdown for at least a year. If the experiment of industry to retain user deposits fails then there may be a slowdown in real money gaming. Else, the growth in the industry will continue at 25 percent per annum,” he said.Most online gaming operators are trying to figure out the right equilibrium of sharing the additional GST cost with the consumer in the most frictionless manner.“We are evolving our business model. Things will become clearer. A lot of operators are trying to figure out how to incentivise users to make alterations to their transaction cycle without changing how much they play. It’s work in progress. The industry will figure out a way, though it will reduce net revenue growth in the short run. Gross revenue growth will not be impacted. The business model will evolve in the new GST rate. The market is still exciting,” Games 24x7 Co-Founder & Co-CEO Trivikraman Thampy told Moneycontrol.Every online gaming company is looking at ways to circumvent the higher GST impact, which will severely hit their bottom line, to give an experience to the user to make him park his deposits for a longer period.“Incentivising users is the best way to mitigate the dip in margins. Companies are doing good on retaining the client base. All the companies have strategy and innovation already ongoing. But the innovation needs to remain within the rules of fantasy sports. Innovation will not impact the ability of a game of skill and cannot extend to make it a game of chance. We will not compromise on it as it’s the core of fantasy sports. As a game of skill, it deepens association with the sport, and if you know more about the sport over time you will win more games,” Federation of Indian Fantasy Sports (FIFS) Director General Joy Bhattacharjya told Moneycontrol.The industry will optimise GST implication over the next one year as they decide their internal long term strategy towards the cost of doing business and stickiness point of view for repeat customers.“As every industry evolves, there is a period of flux, which is the case for the gaming industry. This is a trial by fire phase for the industry, at the end of which there will be clarity. Gaming is a gateway to a lot of future technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and metaverse. Roughly 40 percent of global gamers are in India , but only 1 percent of revenue is in India,” E-Gaming Federation CEO Anuraag Saxena told Moneycontrol."

The views expressed in the article do not reflect the central bank's official stance.The dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, or DSGE, model tries to replicate the interplay between economic fluctuations and the role of policy interventions by using 'shocks' - or ""surprises in the form of mismatches between expectations and outcomes, and subsequent demand-supply adjustments"". The model's assumptions are:>> global growth of 2.6 percent in 2023-24 and 2.1 percent in 2024- 25>> global retail inflation of 5.5 percent in 2023-24 and 4 percent in 2024-25>> a repo rate of 6.5 percent in 2023-24 and 2024-25>> US Fed funds rate of 6.5 percent in 2023-24 and 2024-25As per the model, the Indian economy could grow by 7.1 percent in 2023-24 - 10 basis points higher than the RBI's official forecast of 7.0 percent. Interestingly, in the post-policy press conference on December 8, Deputy Governor Michael Patra had said that high-frequency data for October and November - used by the RBI for its 'nowcast', an updated or quick forecast - were ""very robust"".""So, if you just take October-November data, you will exceed 7 percent (growth in 2023-24). So, at the current time, 7 percent is a conservative estimate,"" Patra had said.As per the RBI's latest 'nowcast', GDP growth in the last quarter of 2023 is tracking at 6.7 percent - 20 basis points higher than the central bank's official view of 6.5 percent. However, the DSGE model estimates the current quarter's growth rate at 6.4 percent.The statistics ministry will release GDP data for October-December 2023 on February 29, 2024.The quarterly growth forecasts as per the RBI's DSGE model and its official forecast are as follows:PERIODOFFICIAL FORECASTDSGE MODEL FORECASTQ3 FY246.5%6.4%Q4 FY246.0%6.6%FY247.0%7.1%Q1 FY256.7%6.1%Q2 FY256.5%5.3%Q3 FY256.4%6.4%Q4 FY25NA6.1%FY256.5%6.0%The growth forecast for next year suggested by the RBI's DSGE model is in stark contrast to the general bullishness about the Indian economy, with data released at the end of November showing that the GDP grew at a much higher than expected rate of 7.6 percent in July-September, comfortably beating nearly all estimates.Also read: India's most optimistic economist just got even more bullishAs a result, economists as well as the RBI have raised their growth forecasts for the current financial year. The finance ministry is also expected to follow suit sometime later this month when it releases it Monthly Economic Review report.While the Indian economy is widely seen slowing down in 2024-25 due to weakness in the global economy and the lagged impact of domestic interest rate hikes, the extent of slowdown suggested by the RBI's DSGE model is far greater than what the central bank and the Indian government have been predicting.However, it is in line with the view of some economists from outside the government. Nomura's Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi, for instance, see India's GDP growth falling to a below-consensus 5.6 percent next year from their forecast of 6.7 percent for 2023-24."

Such views imperil the conduct of monetary policy in the pursuit of its goal of durably aligning inflation with the target. These views also undermine the foundations of growth,"" it added.The monthly State of the Economy article includes Deputy Governor Michael Patra - one of the three RBI representatives on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - as one of its co-authors. The views expressed in the article do not reflect the central bank's official stance.The comments come after the MPC held the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent for the fifth meeting in a row on December 8. And while market participants were pleasantly surprised by some cooling of hawkishness from the RBI on the liquidity front, Governor Shaktikanta Das refused to provide any sort of forward guidance on interest rates or the stance of policy, saying it would be ""a mistake"" to think the RBI was giving ""any kind of a signal, that we are moving towards neutral"".""Reaching 4 percent should not just be a one-off event… The MPC should have confidence that, yes, 4 percent has now become durable,"" Das had said.Data released since the MPC's December 8 decision showed that India's headline retail inflation rate rose less than expected to 5.55 percent in November, with economists broadly expecting it to rise further in December and test the upper-bound the RBI's 2-6 percent tolerance range. According to the RBI's latest forecasts, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is seen averaging 4 percent in July-September 2024, meaning that it would hit the medium-term target after almost five years.CPI inflation was last at the target rate in September 2019, when it had come in at 3.99 percent.Economists, meanwhile, see the MPC beginning to cut the policy repo rate around the middle of 2024. But in the State of the Economy article, the RBI's economists added further warnings on the inflation front.""The objective of aligning inflation with the target on a durable basis is far from assured... inflation is hurting discretionary consumer spending and this, in turn, is holding back top-line growth of manufacturing companies as well as their capex. If inflation is not brought back to the target and tethered there, there is a strong likelihood that growth may falter,"" they said. Source: Reserve Bank of IndiaAs per the State of the Economy paper, the medium-term outlook for inflation is higher than the RBI's official forecast. As per a 'dynamic stochastic general equilibrium' (DSGE) model developed by the RBI, CPI inflation is seen averaging 4.8 percent in 2024-25 - 30 basis points higher than the RBI's official forecast of 4.5 percent, mentioned in the October edition of the Monetary Policy Report.The aforementioned DSGE model assumes global GDP growth of 2.6 percent and 2.1 percent for 2023-24 and 2024- 25, respectively; global retail inflation of 5.5 percent and 4.0 percent for 2023-24 and 2024-25, respectively; and an unchanged policy repo rate and US Fed funds rate of 6.5 percent and 5.5 percent for the current and next financial year, respectively."

As a result, buyers were often sold packs that had a standard number, but weighed less than they should have.","The Consumer Affairs Ministry has begun tightening the screws on the construction sector, mandating that welding electrodes must be sold in kilograms instead of pieces/numbers. It has also issued notices to tile companies, asking them to mention tile sizes on the boxes.An order passed by the Legal Metrology division of the Consumer Affairs Ministry on November 30, has directed the manufacturers of this equipment to “declare quantity of each unit in weight… to give accurate & adequate information to consumers.”""It has come to the notice of the ministry that welding electrodes are being sold in pieces or numbers as unit of measurement while in other countries it is sold in kg,” the notice read. It directed manufacturers/ importers/ packers to sell these welding electrodes in weight with the diameter of the welding rod in the interest of consumers. The order will be applicable from January 1, 2024.Welding electrodes are metal wires or rods that carry current and are used to generate heat for welding. They have a chemical coating that prevents burning.Used in all types of infrastructure development, these rods are crucial for a structure to sustain pressure on it. “If welding is not done right, the structure may crack,” Hardik Sanghvi, Director of Bombay based company, Royal Arc Electrodes told Moneycontrol.Before the order was passed, industry players used number/pieces as a unit of measurement, he said. “This led to malpractices among manufacturers who kept the numbers the same but reduced the diameters/weight of this electrode,” Sanghvi said.The ministry consulted with several stakeholders and went through international practices before passing the order, Director, Legal Metrology division, Ashutosh Agarwal said.“A weak electrode will result in poor welding which will prove ineffective for infrastructure projects. Consumers, often not in the know of such minute details, bought whatever was being provided. Now we have mandated all manufacturers to describe units in kilograms which will bring similarity throughout the industry while discouraging those indulging in malpractices,” he told Moneycontrol.The Consumer Affairs Ministry has also issued a similar notice to tile companies, asking them to declare dimensions as well as number of tiles on the boxes of manufactured products. The ministry has also directed all manufacturers and sellers to mention the month and year of manufacturing on all prepared commodities. The orders have been made implementable from January,1, 2024."

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. The government's introduction of the Telecom Bill 2023 has sparked significant reactions from various quarters. While the industry has embraced the initiative, civil rights organisations have voiced concerns.This bill aims to replace the archaic Indian Telegraph Act of 1885, the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933 and the Telegraph Wires (Unlawful Possession) Act of 1950. Additionally, it proposes amendments to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Act of 1997 without diminishing TRAI's authority.One notable positive aspect the industry acknowledges is the streamlining of the telecom licensing process and increased transparency regarding spectrum availability. The new legislation is expected to expedite the rollout of 5G services by providing legal support for the right of way (ROW) rules.A significant aspect of the bill lies in replacing the licensing framework with 'authorisations'. Telecom operators and service providers must obtain these authorisations from the relevant authorities. Spectrum allocation will primarily be conducted through auctions, with administrative allotments reserved for satellite TV and broadband. The legislation also introduces predictability regarding the surrender of unused spectrum.It's worth noting that the bill does not cover Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram. The legislation designates telecom as 'critical infrastructure' and imposes penalties on those who cause harm to it. Users are assigned specific responsibilities, with consumer protection provisions requiring prior consent for receiving certain categories of messages. Violations of these regulations will result in penalties and imprisonment.Civil rights groups have expressed dissatisfaction with the central government's complete control over the telecom network. The central government can authorise Internet shutdowns, and message transmission can be halted in public emergencies.While the final bill is likely to face scrutiny, with dissenting opinions, there is consensus that it will contribute to fortifying the country's telecom infrastructure. Gopal Vittal, the CEO of Bharti Airtel, aptly summarises that the bill ensures predictability and spectrum availability and aids in expanding telecom penetration in the nation.Investing insights from our research teamHave Indian IT stocks rallied way ahead of fundamentals?MC Pro New Year Portfolio: These 17 stocks show promise for a rewarding 2024Varun Beverages: Is there more fizz left after the run-up?Azad Engineering IPO: Four reasons why we are cautiousWhat else are we reading?IMF report points to uneven growth, low productivity in Indian economyTepid performance of unlisted companies may be the reason for sluggish corporate capexChart of the Day: Road sector hits a speed bumpHow will global supply chains look like in 2024?

RBI ""strongly disagreed"" with the IMF's assessment.The IMF has reclassified India's ""de facto"" exchange rate regime to ""stabilised arrangement"" from ""floating"" for December 2022 to October 2023. According to RBI, the IMF's reclassification is “unjustified,"" the report said.RBI officials, in their meetings with the IMF, said the forex interventions were in line with the ""best principles of transparency"" and that the rupee's exchange rate continues to be market determined.In RBI’s view, IMF staff's assessment is short-term and restricted to the last six to eight months without any rationale for the same, and if a longer-term view of two to five years is taken, the IMF's assessment would fail.On the debt to GDP ratio, the IMF noted that given the shocks India has had to face, the debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 100 percent in the medium term. Indian officials disagree. According to KV Subramanian, IMF's Executive Director for India and a former Chief Economic Adviser to the government, it ""sounds extreme"". ""Despite the multitude of shocks, the global economy has faced in the past two decades, India's public debt to GDP ratio at the general government level has barely increased from 81 percent in 2005-06 to 84 percent in 2021-22 and back to 81 percent in 2022-23,"" Subramanian said in a statement as part of the IMF report.PraisesIMF, however, also praised Indian authorities on the economy's strong performance adding that it has the potential to ""grow faster and more sustainably if a comprehensive structural reform agenda is implemented""."

However, the government’s measures have started taking effect and prices of tur fell to Rs 154 per kg on December 18 from Rs 156.5 a month ago.“It has been about two weeks since we have started seeing green shoots in tur as prices of this commodity have come down for the first time in the past few months,” Singh told Moneycontrol.Prices have declined on the back of kharif supplies arriving in the market, increased imports, a seasonal fall in demand and easier import norms.“Pulse stocks have started arriving in the markets and are bringing down prices of all pulses, which is having a cumulative effect on tur as well,” Singh said.Pulse imports from Mozambique, Canada, Russia and Australia are about to come in, signalling increased availability. The government on December 8 exempted yellow peas (tur) from import duties until the end of this financial year, removing minimum import prices and port restrictions to facilitate trade.The centre has started procuring tur dal directly from farmers at market prices to build a buffer stock that will be offloaded in the market when prices rise. Funds for the procurement are being taken from the Price Stabilisation Fund.“Additionally, there is always a 15-20 percent fall in demand for pulses in winters when the price-sensitive section of society opts for cheaper vegetables such as palak and methi instead of dal,” the secretary added.High consumptionTur consumption has been higher than domestic production. The country's tur output fell 20 percent to 3.43 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July–June) from 4.29 million tonnes a year earlier. The country consumes about 4.5 million tonnes of tur every year.The agriculture ministry’s first advance estimates for the crop season 2023-24 put tur production slightly lower at 3.42 million tonnes.As per government data, India imported about 778,000 tonnes of tur in calendar year 2023 from Mozambique, Myanmar and Tanzania.Anticipating a shortfall in tur and urad output due to erratic weather, the Centre in January extended the duty-free import policy for the two commodities until March 31, 2024. The Department of Consumer Affairs has since monitored stock levels of pulses, including tur and urad.Additionally, the government on June 2 allowed traders to keep only limited stocks of tur and urad. Following this step, the government released tur from the national buffer stocks to arrest the price rise.The government launched chana dal under the packaging of ‘Bharat Dal’ at subsidised prices of Rs 60 per kg throughout the country, intending to shift consumption for those who cannot afford expensive arhar or tur dal.Food prices rose sharply in November, taking inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index to 5.55 percent, a three-month high. Prices of pulses climbed 20.23 percent."

The multilateral agency expects India's GDP to grow by 6.3 percent in the current year as well as the next.While the IMF may upgrade its growth forecast and bring it more in line with that of the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its update to the World Economic Outlook in January, there are differences in its assessment of India and that of the authorities. Moneycontrol takes a quick look at four such key items.Fiscal consolidationTo be fair to the IMF, it has praised the Indian government's ""near-term fiscal policy which focuses on accelerating capital spending while tightening the fiscal stance"". It also pointed out that the government is committed to reducing the fiscal deficit to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26 from 5.9 percent this year, with the reduction to be ""implemented approximately evenly"" over the next two years.However, the IMF thinks India needs to do more and needs an ""ambitious fiscal consolidation path"" to re-build its buffers and reduce debt in a sustainable manner.Also read: Moving the goalposts — fiscal deficit target and a 20-year delay""Based on currently announced policies, the primary deficit gradually narrows to around 2 percent of GDP by 2028-29. Maintaining this deficit and assuming nominal economic growth of 10.5 percent and interest rate at 6.25 percent implies that debt would eventually stabilise at around 57 percent of GDP. However, starting from current debt levels, this would take decades to reach; in 10 years debt is still above 76 percent of GDP,"" the IMF noted. It added that given the shocks India has had to face, the debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 100 percent in the medium term. Source: International Monetary FundIndian officials disagree. According to KV Subramanian, IMF's Executive Director for India and a former Chief Economic Adviser to the government, it ""sounds extreme"" that India's debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 100 percent.""Despite the multitude of shocks, the global economy has faced in the past two decades, India's public debt to GDP ratio at the general government level has barely increased from 81 percent in 2005-06 to 84 percent in 2021-22 and back to 81 percent in 2022-23,"" Subramanian said in a statement as part of the IMF report.Foreign exchange interventionOver the years, Indian authorities’ intervention in the foreign exchange market has invited criticism, with the US even placing India on its currency manipulation watch-list in the past. This view is seemingly shared by the IMF, which said in its report that India's interventions in the forex market ""likely exceeded levels necessary to address disorderly market conditions and has contributed to the rupee-USD moving within a narrow range since December 2022"".Also Read: RBI Governor Das says currency manipulation charges sound hegemonicHowever, RBI officials were having none of it. The report noted the RBI ""strongly disagreed"" with the IMF's assessment and said the agency was picking data ""selectively"". ""In their (RBI) view, (IMF) staff's assessment is short-term and restricted to the last six to eight months without any rationale for the same, and if a longer-term view of two to five years is taken, the IMF's assessment would fail. In the authorities' view, therefore, IMF's reclassification of the de facto exchange rate regime to 'stabilised arrangement' is unjustified,"" the report said, adding that RBI officials, in their meetings with the IMF, said the interventions were in line with the ""best principles of transparency"" and that the rupee's exchange rate continues to be market determined.Trade barriersThe IMF also took issue with India's trade practices on two counts. One, it said inflation in India did not rise sharply in 2022 due to ""extensive government interventions (e.g., restrictions on wheat, sugar, and rice exports, removal of tax on import of lentils, reversal of earlier increases in excise duties on petrol and diesel)"". In this, it said India should unwind its ""recent restrictive trade policies…expeditiously"" and called on it to focus on agricultural reforms, which would provide ""a more durable solution to fostering domestic food security"".Also Read: Trade measures can ease food inflation only in short run, says MPC's Shashanka BhideRejecting this criticism, Subramanian said inflation did not rise as much in India as in other countries in 2022 because of ""India's sui generis economic policy during the Covid-19 pandemic that anticipated that the pandemic also presented a significant supply-side shock, which led to India implementing a judicious mix of demand-side and supply-side measures"".The second suggestion on trade from the IMF staff was to reduce India's ""long-standing high tariff and non-tariff import barriers"" and phase out the recently introduced restrictions on the import of laptops and personal computers. But according to Subramanian, the IMF is painting an incorrect picture of India here.Citing the World Bank's World Integrated Trade Solution database, the former Chief Economic Adviser said India's non-tariff measures are ""significantly lower than leading economies"". If anything, the higher non-tariff measures imposed by leading economies are hurting India's service sector, Subramanian argued.Financial sector risksFinally, the IMF has classified India's financial sector vulnerabilities as 'medium', warning that a ""sudden increase in sovereign risk premia"" could exert pressure on balance sheets and banks' appetite to lend.Again, Subramanian dismissed this as ""far-fetched"" on account of India's strong fundamentals. He also disagreed with the 'medium' risk vulnerability tag given to the Indian financial sector, arguing that the sector is strong and resilient.""The banking system is in its best shape in more than a decade. There are no major vulnerabilities, and they are well capitalised… even if an external or domestic shock occur, both banks and non-banks are well positioned not to amplify those shocks and continue to provide financial services to the real economy,"" he added."

At least eight initial public offerings (IPOs) are set to open for subscription this week. Of this, three have already hit the Street on Monday. While three new public issues opened on Tuesday, two more IPOs are scheduled to open in the next two days.The reduction in inflation and the halt to interest rate hikes by the central banks have revived sentiments in the equity markets, stoking fund raising activity. The number of IPOs so far in 2023 has surpassed 2022 levels even though total proceeds are lower than the previous year due to higher mix of small-cap public issues.The 2023 IPO calendar has been marked by the successful public issues of Tata Technologies, Mankind Pharma which helped maintain investor interest in the primary market. The buoyant market has helped India raise its share in global IPO volume, points out EY, a consultancy.Measures such as the reduction in time for listing of the securities after the closure of the public issue will help improve primary market efficiency and benefit investors. Greater flexibility in market entry and exit can attract more investments. “Direct listing of Indian incorporated companies on global exchanges remains under discussion and could lead to more activity,” adds EY.As for the IPOs that are currently open, our Research Team is at work to help you pick the right stocks.

The clients try to push more clauses including capping the pricing and asking for outcome-based deals,"" said former Infosys CFO V Balakrishnan.""It was witnessed during 2008 when the global financial crisis happened, and in 2001 during the dot-com crash,"" he said.Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys did not respond to Reuters' requests seeking comment. HCLTech declined to comment on specific deal terms.More than 80% of more than 1,600 IT and business process management deals tracked in 2023 had some form of committed-savings clause, versus around 65% in 2019, data from IT research firm Everest Group showed.Such cost-saving clauses are either baked into the pricing, or companies risk a cut in fees if the savings are not achieved, Everest Group CEO Peter Bendor-Samuel said.Contracts with such clauses that were signed this year include HCLTech's $2.1 billion deal with Verizon and a $454 million deal between Infosys and Danske Bank, a person familiar with the deal terms said.Under the Danske Bank deal, which runs for five years, Infosys will digitise the lender's operations and take over its delivery centre in India, while the Verizon deal, which runs for six years, will see HCLTech become the U.S. firm's primary tech partner for network deployments, according to exchange filings.TOUGH TIMESThe tougher contracts are likely to add pressure on an industry that is already struggling. India's second-biggest software-services exporter by sales Infosys has already predicted its slowest annual sales expansion in at least a decade for the current financial year ending March 2024.The big IT firms classify contracts worth $100 million or above as large deals and those above $500 million as mega deals, which are typically struck when demand is low.TCS, Infosys and HCLTech have won seven mega deals since May, company disclosures show, while Wipro did not win any mega deals. Its Chief Growth Officer Stephanie Trautman, who was leading the large deals team, resigned earlier this month.The tougher terms tied to the large IT deals are an attempt by clients to hedge against the global economic uncertainty, deal advisors said.""Clients are increasingly seeking predictable business outcomes and assurances to protect their interests in large deals that often span five years or more,"" said Avinash Baliga, partner at deal advisor Avasant.The inclusion of committed-cost-savings clauses in deal agreements has climbed to 50-60% presently versus 20% in the last decade, Baliga added.The clauses also reflect a rise in client maturity.""Customers have become much more aware of the possibilities and scenarios that could play out during a deal tenure,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, vice-president and research director at Forrester India. ""Now, clients are asking IT players too to share risks and rewards."""

It has exported an average of 6.8 million tons of sugar over the past five years, making it the No.2 shipper in that period. It was surpassed last year by Thailand.* The Indian Sugar Mills Association said in August net production could fall to 31.7 million tons in the year that began in October.* More than 180 farmers from 11 cane-producing districts of Maharashtra and another 49 farmers from Karnataka all told Reuters lower monsoon rainfall during the crucial growth phase stunted crop development. Reuters spoke with at least 10 farmers in each of the districts that account for most production in the two states. India is home to some 50 million sugar farmers.* Reuters calculated the drop in per-acre cane yields and likely drop in the next year's cane area using an average derived from responses received from farmers scattered across key growing districts, cultivating different kinds of cane varieties. Some varieties mature in 10 months, while others take up to 18 months.* Internal forecasts from five trading houses for this year's output range between 29 million and 30 million tons. Reuters calculations based on farmer interviews found output could drop 12.2% this year to 29.05 million tons.* Output could fall further the following year, with three houses predicting a crop in the 25 million to 26.9 million ton range, also in line with Reuters' calculations for production of 26.6 million tons.* India's sugar consumption is set to hit a record 29.2 million tons this year, rising to roughly 30 million tons the following year, according to traders' forecasts.* In Maharashtra, the lower rainfall led to a 16% average drop in cane yield, with some regions experiencing declines of up to 40%, according to farmers.* A 10% decline in cane area in Maharashtra, according to a government official, coupled with potential diversions for fodder and jaggery-making in 2% of the crop, would lead to a 28% reduction in net sugar production in the state to 7.55 million tons this year, based on Reuters calculations.* Karnataka faces a 13% reduction in cane cultivation area and anticipated yield drops of 25% for the current year, according to the survey of farmers. That indicates a potential decline in sugar production to 3.7 million tons.* However, Uttar Pradesh, with better irrigation, is expected to deliver a 9.7% increase in output to 11.5 million tons this year, rising to 12.4 million tons next year due to lower sucrose diversion for ethanol, according to trade houses.* Farmers across key growing areas of the two states, grappling with water scarcity, told Reuters they plan to either reduce cane cultivation or abandon it totally.* Calculations based on their feedback could result in a potential 32% reduction in Maharashtra's sugarcane area and a 29% decrease in Karnataka's for the marketing year starting October 2024. Several factors, including rainfall in next year's monsoon, will ultimately determine the crop size.* Shrinking planting could slash Maharashtra's production next year to 5.1 million tons and Karnataka's to 2.6 million tons, which would be their lowest since the 2016/17 crop year.* The availability of ratoon crop is also expected to drop as many farmers were forced to uproot the plants because of water scarcity. Ratoon is the cane root stub after the first harvest, which remains in the ground for a second harvest.* Maharashtra mills said that the sugar recovery rate - the amount extracted from cane during milling - is lower than normal due to higher temperatures.Net sugar output in mln tons 2022/23 2023/24* 2024/25**Maharashtra 10.53 7.55 5.1Karnataka 5.98 3.7 2.6Uttar Pradesh 10.48 11.5 12.4Others 6.11 6.3 6.5Total 33.1 29.05 26.6The above figures for 2022/23 are from official data and the forecasts for the following two years are calculations based on Reuters' survey of farmers in Maharashtra and Karnataka. The estimates for Uttar Pradesh are based on inputs provided by trade houses.* For the 2023/24 period, the government's recent decision to limit diversion of sugar up to 1.7 million tons for ethanol production has been factored in.** For 2024/25, it is presumed the government will prohibit ethanol production from B-heavy molasses and cane juice/syrup."

Additionally, household inflation expectations could be sensitive to rising wages if higher corporate profits translate into increased labour demand.Hence, the dichotomy between the US Fed’s dialing down of its hawkish stance of 'higher for longer' replaced with benign guidance of three rate cuts in 2024, instead of two, and the continued hawkish stance of the ECB and the BoE is pivoted on the significant difference in their assessments.Unlike the other two, the Fed’s confidence emanates from its belief in attaining a soft-landing trajectory that achieves price stability without any economic disruption.However, the Fed’s guidance and projections since the post-pandemic expansion have seen significant errors and recasts, with the current guidance seemingly veering back to its misplaced transitory inflation thesis of 2021.Also read: Kotak Securities anticipates limited upside for Nifty levels next year: Here’s whyWhile factors highlighted by both the ECB and the BoE are germane to the US economy as well, there are US-specific additional facts that deserve attention.a) The US labour market is still in disequilibrium: The unemployment rate at 3.7 percent remains close to historical lows and labour demand/supply ratio at 1.34x is still high by historical standards.b) Risks to upward revision in inflation projections continue remain: Reduction in the Fed’s inflation projection for 2024 at 2.4 percent is guided by three-month average month-on-month changes in core PCE, including the abnormal dip in August 2023. A higher monthly rise than 20bp might lead to an upward revision in the projected inflation for 2024 and 2025.c) The projected US GDP trajectory remains above potential: The upgrade of real GDP growth to 2.6 percent for 2023 and 1.4 percent for 2024 implies 2024 real GDP to be 2.4 percent higher than projected at the start of 2023 and 0.4 percent higher than Fed’s long-term trajectory growing at 1.8 percent. The projected positive output gap and tight labour market portends upside risk to inflation.Also read: Budget 2024: 5 lesser-known facts about the Union Budgetd) Consumption remains above trend: The household situation remains strong with the real personal consumption growth at 2.2 percent YoY trending above the post-Covid potential trend by around 3.0-3.2 percent.A combination of a falling savings rate and an above-trend consumption could be the reason for the recent rise in labour participation. However, with a strong demand situation, the easing of financial conditions with premature rate cuts could lead to a resurgence of inflation as the impact of the rising wealth effect from asset price resurgence on demand could nullify the positive labour supply responses. This would intensify the positive demand gap and challenge the achievements towards price stability objectives.Important monetary policy considerations for 2024 will also be the US presidential elections, which may imply political overtures. Fed’s monetary policy conduct can get complicated if it turns accommodative toward rising fiscal deficit and public debt. History of the early 1970s tells us that erring on the side of accommodation when the economy is still above trend can cause inflationary impulses to relapse, specially in the current context of rising protectionism, and declining Chinese savings.The direction of these factors will show up during 2024 and does not portend a unidirectional buoyancy. But for now, the markets are soaking in on the Asynchronous Pivot with the Fed being the outlier.The dominance of Fed’s communique has overwhelmed the markets with significant triggers across the markets, including equities, rates, and currencies.From India’s standpoint, the market liquidity momentum has experienced a second trigger following the recent States election results. The drop in the US risk-free rate (10-year at 3.9 percent from 5 percent in October 2023) has pushed up valuations, particularly for IT (+8 percent), Metals (+5 percent), and Realty (+3.8 percent) relatively higher than for Nifty (2.3 percent).From the macro-cycle standpoint, underlying the strong headline real GDP growth of 7.7 percent in 1HFY24, India’s core growth is modest, around 3.0-3.5 percent, i.e., aligning with household consumption and income (76 percent of GDP). Consequently, corporate results are likely to show feeble topline growth, a rise in inventory, and lingering margin gains, which may be transient.In the context of the latest global developments, our overweight view on the IT sector needs to be stepped up. While valuations for bank and metals stocks tend to benefit from weaker USD, as triggered by a dovish Fed, we remain cautious about their business outlook along with onset of the retail NPA cycle.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

In view of this, it is difficult to anticipate the quantum of actual proceeds from disinvestment during the current fiscal,” minister of state for finance Bhagwat Kishanrao Karad told Lok Sabha in a written reply on December 18.Government policy on disinvestment is implemented through the strategic disinvestment, wherin the entire or substantial sale of the government shareholding in CPSEs along with transfer of management control takes place, and minority stake sale.In PSEs, where the government continues to retain control, disinvestment through minority stake sale is carried out through various SEBI-approved methods such as Initial Public Offer (IPO), Offer for Sale (OFS), buyback of shares etc. from time to time based on prevailing market conditions and investor interest.The government, since 2016, has given in-principle approval for strategic disinvestment of 36 cases of public sector enterprises (PSEs). Out of the 33 transactions being handled by DIPAM, strategic disinvestment has been completed in 10 cases including Air India and Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL).Among the ongoing transactions for strategic disinvestment include BEML Limited, Shipping Corporation of India, HLL Lifecare, IDBI Bank, Container Corporation of India Limited, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, NMDC Steel.For Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Bhadrawati Steel Plant, which is a unit of Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), the expression of interest (EoI) process was called off due to lack of sufficient bidder’s interest to proceed. For Pawan Hans Limited and Central Electronics Limited (CEL) the successful bidder was disqualified and the transaction terminated. In the case of Alloy Steel Plant, Durgapur (unit of SAIL) the transaction stands halted for the time being.Some of the transactions, including  Scooters India Limited, were halted by DIPAM as the PSEs were recommended for closure.The strategic disinvestment of Engineering Projects India Limited and Bridge & Roof Company (India) Limited are not feasible, he said.The strategic sale of various units of India Tourism Development Corporation Limited is being processed by the administrative ministry."

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. While no one really knows why exactly markets go up or down – demand for and supply of shares is probably the most authentic answer there is — that does not stop anyone from trying. Today, the main market indices are down a bit, but after a week of a hefty rally, a pause for breath is not out of character for equities. It may also be a cycling of themes, as large caps have been doing well in recent days and therefore there's a slight pullback while today, mid and small caps are up.(Don’t miss reading the MC Pro New Year Portfolio 2024, linked at the end of this newsletter)On that subject, India Ratings put out a study that raises an amber flag on credit profiles of mid and small companies in FY24 and beyond. We plucked a few charts from that study that we found interesting to make our Chart of the Day. It chiefly considers how rising debt ratios and a deteriorating working capital profile could squeeze them harder than large companies. In turn, this means that for growth to sustain at higher levels (and to sustain valuations), they may need to borrow more which can strain their credit profiles. Or, it may lead to one more outcome, do read to know what.But the rumble in markets is not restricted to India and the pressure is visible across Asian markets. The Bank of Japan may shift its stance from its ‘uber-easy’ policies and there is some nervousness on a US inflation gauge — the core personal consumption expenditure index — and if it will pour some cold water on the very optimistic rate cut assumptions being factored in 2024.But even before that, the index’s release is parsed for clues, here’s a note of caution from Mohamed El-Erian, who has been a voice of reason in these years of ultra-loose monetary policy and accurately predicted the Fed’s misstep on assuming high inflation was transitory. In a booming market, few like cautionary messages, but it’s always good to test your optimism against these and see if the premise still holds. El-Erian main concern is, “The more the Fed gives in to investor expectations for sizeable and early rate cuts in 2024 — including getting closer to the six cuts priced in for next year — the more the markets will press for an even more dovish policy stance.” Read for more.Even the flash PMIs are flashing an amber signal, writes Manas Chakravarty in today’s edition, asking investors to not take central banks’ pivots for granted. He cites five crucial points from the survey used to derive the flash PMI figures and writes, “These points do not seem to paint a scenario where the central bank should be in a hurry to signal rate cuts. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence said: “Looser financial conditions have helped boost demand, business activity and employment in the service sector, and have also helped lift future output expectations higher.”While these are the considerations for a top-down approach to investing, look no further if you are on the hunt for some bright sparks to add to your portfolio.

600,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/its-high-time-india-transitioned-away-from-industrial-agriculture-11920891.html,It’s high time India transitioned away from industrial agriculture,"December 18, 2023 02:45 PM IST","The Green Revolution was an important intervention at a time when India needed cereal self-sufficiency. But the industrial agriculture that it gave birth to is proving disastrous for India’s farmers. The high input costs, supply gluts, erratic climate, etc are leading to falling farm incomes, debt traps and farmer suicides","Dead farmers are the litmus test of any civilised society. On December 4, a mirror was held up for all of India as NCRB data revealed a dark underbelly of our progress – 11,290 farmers and farm workers committed suicide in 2022. So basically even before one finishes their Netflix movie or gets home from work one or two farmers/farm workers have died by their own hands. Strangulating not only themselves and their families, but also choking the conscience of our civilisation.The picture gets grimmer – farm related suicides have gone up by 3.7 percent from 2021 and about 5.7 percent from 2020. As much as 53 percent of 11,290 suicides or about 6,083 are of agricultural workers.What’s Killing Our Farmers?Surprisingly the highest number of suicides are reported in “progressive agri” states where industrial agriculture and “modern” GM crop is well established. Maharashtra tops the list followed by Karnataka and then Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh also saw a high number of reported farmers suicides. Some of the states where agriculture is still more traditional and small scale like West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Goa, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura all reported zero suicides.Another shocking figure was the number of suicides in Chattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh. UP reported a 42.13 percent and Chattisgarh a 31.65 percent increase in suicides. On the positive side Kerala saw a 30 percent decline in farmer/farm worker suicides.The 1960s saw the advent of industrial agriculture – the Green Revolution. The newer agri-chemical input-dependent seeds, along with mechanisation and agri-chemicals swerved India’s food systems from self-sufficiency towards market/industry dependence. To its credit, these technologies helped India become cereals-sufficient and over the years India even exported rice and wheat.But it also had  a hidden cost – ecological destruction, rural debt and food style diseases. Punjab with its highest rural debt,  overexploited groundwater, dead soils, cancer trains and social unrest (drug addiction to insurgency) is a prime example of what industrial agriculture can do to a society.The hidden costs, more recently, were best described by Kishore Tiwari, then chairman of The Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission (VNSSM), set up by the Maharashtra government. He called Bt Cotton and sugarcane “killer crops” as they were trapping farmers in debt and forcing them to commit suicide. He recommended that both these crops should be removed from the Vidarba and Marathwada region.The Debt TrapAbout 84 percent of farmers suicides coincidently from the cotton growing areas where BT cotton is grown. There is a disproportionate relationship between the area under cotton and the rate of suicide among cotton farmers especially in Maharashtra and also Andha Pradesh. Sugarcane farming in dry parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka has added to incomes for few, but caused a larger destruction for the rural society.Because both of these crops are very input heavy – meaning they require expensive seeds, agri-chemicals, agri-industrial processing etc, the farmers have to borrow more money to cultivate them. The stakes and interest rates are so high that even one bad year can push the farming family into debt and in the successive years compounding debt rates, which the farmers rarely escape.  And it’s not just these two crops, the system of industrial agriculture each year requires more expensive inputs. Meanwhile, the value of agri commodities or crops fall each year, shrinking the farmers’ profit even more.The prices of everything from fertilisers to fuel have been volatile and what aggravates the wounds for farmers is that the climate has been unkind for the past couple of years. These factors have pushed them into deeper debt. Another major gap was the inability of the government flagship scheme like crop insurance to cushion the blow of the erratic weather.Escaping The Industrial “Medicine”When it comes to food security, India has come a long way from the 1960s, and completed a full circle. From receiving benefits, now we are in the crashing phase of the Green Revolution. Dead farmers, bad soils, contaminated and exploited water, and rural debt is the blowback from this technology.Not to forget the explosion of food style diseases in India which also is directly linked to our agrarian production. Maybe that is the reason why even the father of the Indian Green Revolution MS Swaminathan towards the end of his life advocated for eco-technology and biodiversity based approach to farming.We have to align our farmers with their agro-climatic zones and encourage them to follow a nature based model of sustainable biodiverse agriculture. This is the one of the safest ways to ensure nutrition and income security for the farming families and at the same point reduce the dependence on industrial systems or fertilisers and subsidies.Indra Shekhar Singh is an independent agri-policy analyst and writer.

Moller-Maersk, CMA CGM and Hapag Lloyd — have paused or suspended Red Sea operations as Yemen's Houthi militants stepped up their assaults on commercial vessels.","The Red Sea, a vital waterway for global commerce and energy shipped between Europe and Asia, is being temporarily abandoned by leading shipping firms following a spree of attacks on commercial vessels by Yemen's Houthi rebels.This has spelled concern for international maritime trade, as the Red Sea is used for shipping through the Suez Canal, the world's arterial route for East-West trade. The 193-km long canal accounts for 12 percent of global trade, including 30 percent of all container movement, according to Egypt, which owns and operates it.What happened?The Iran-backed Houthis, who control vast swathes of Yemen including its crucial western coast, have attacked commercial ships connected to Israel and Israeli businessmen since October, following the outbreak of the war in Gaza.On December 9, the Houthis escalated their threat by announcing that they would target all ships heading towards or returning from Israeli ports, irrespective of their nationality. The group has demanded an end to the Israeli military offensive against Gaza.The Houthis have so far attacked 13 commercial vessels, using drones and anti-ship missiles. The vessels have been targeted in Bab el-Mandeb, the strait that is the gateway to the Red Sea and is located between the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden.The Houthi threat particularly sparked concern on December 15, when the militants used anti-ship missiles against MSC PALATIUM III, a Liberian-flagged ship operated by the world's largest shipping carrier MSC.Shipping giants pull backFollowing the December 15 attack, MSC joined three of the world's other leading shipping companies -- CMA CGM, Hapag Lloyd, and AP Moller-Maersk -- to temporarily suspend its operations in the Red Sea. The four companies cumulatively account for 53 percent of global maritime trade, The Economist reported, citing industry estimates.The company, in a statement, said it would be re-routing some of its services through the Cape of Good Hope. The trading route, that passes through the southern coastline of Africa, will delay shipments by 19 to 30 days, said Noam Raydan, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.“To protect the lives and safety of our seafarers, until the Red Sea passage is safe, our ships will not transit the Suez Canal Eastbound and Westbound,"" MSC said.Maersk, the world's second largest shipping company with a 14.8 percent share in global trade, said on December 15 that it would be pausing its operations in the Red Sea. The announcement came a day after its vessel, Maersk Gibraltar, was attempted to be attacked by Houthi rebels.“Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice,” a company spokesperson told Moneycontrol. The crisis has been pushing up freight charges, with spot rates for 40-foot containers jumping by 12% over the past week (Source: Bloomberg)The importance of Suez CanalThe significance of the Suez Canal was highlighted in March 2021, when the container ship Ever Given was stuck for six days. The 399.94 metre-long vessel obstructed the route, thereby halting all trading activities and leading to a global supply chain crisis.The canal is one of the world's busiest waterways, with ships traversing through it to bring goods between Asia and Europe. ""A total of 12 percent of the global trade volume flows through it annually,"" Egypt's State Information Service says in a note published on its website, adding that 30 percent of the global containers traverse through it.A massive portion of Europe’s overall energy supplies, including oil and diesel fuel, come through that waterway, said John Stawpert, senior manager of environment and trade for the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents 80 percent of the world’s commercial fleet.The canal is also key to the supply of food products like palm oil and grain, and anything else brought over on container ships, which are most of the world’s manufactured products.How does it concern India?Suez Canal is used by India for maritime trade worth ""around $200 billion"", Pawan Kumar Agarwal, special secretary (logistics), had told CNBC TV-18 in 2021, when India was among the countries that had felt the pinch due to the blockage caused by the stranded Ever Given vessel.The quantum of trade is expected to have gone up in the post-pandemic period. The stakes becoming higher for India was reflected in June this year when Egypt was ready to offer New Delhi a dedicated cluster in the industrial and logistics hub of the Suez Canal Economic Zone.India's exports, via the Suez Canal, include food products, apparel, and electronics, among others to Europe, but its imports include the vital shipments of crude, analysts pointed out. ""Since the crisis holds the potential to disrupt crude shipments from Russia, New Delhi is bound to be concerned,"" an independent researcher said.Data from Kpler showed a 9 percent rise in India's monthly intake of Russian oil in November from the previous month to 1.73 million barrels per day (bpd). The shipments are presently routed through the Suez Canal, and a wider conflict in the region that disrupts maritime trade may compel India to look at alternatives, another analyst pointed out.While India and Russia indicated in November that they would soon be using the Eastern Maritime Corridor -- connecting the Indian port city of Chennai with the Russian port of Vladivostok -- the route is yet to be turned operational.The crisis in Red Sea is ""definitely a point of concern"" for India, said Sourish Ghosh, a Kolkata-based independent researcher. ""There is a possibility that India may join other countries to safeguard the route from attacks. It may also use its Navy to sanitize the space but it is also a possibility that considering India's cordial relations with Iran, Houthis might spare India's interests in the region,"" he added.International response so farThe US and the UK, which share naval ties with a number of Arab countries adjoining the Red Sea, have used their vessels to intercept Houthi drones. An American vessel shot down 14 suspected attack drones on December 16, whereas, one drone was struck down by a British warship based in the region.US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who has embarked on a visit to Middle East — covering Israel, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain — is expected to announce the formation of an expanded maritime protection force to protect commercial vehicles passing through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, news agencies reported.The expanded force, to be provisionally titled as Operation Prosperity Guardian, will involve a number of Arab countries, the reports added.""The Red Sea is critical to global trade and any escalation in this key shipping route will have impact on East-West Trade...the US Defence Secretary is likely to announce the formation of a new maritime protection task force to provide reassurance to commercial shipping companies that Houthi attacks will be prevented,"" said Sanket Joshi, Research Associate, Delhi Policy Group.Saudi Arabia, which was at war with the Houthis from 2015 to earlier this year, has urged the US and its allies to exercise restraint in their response, Reuters reported, citing sources. Riyadh has been locked in negotiations with the Houthis in a bid to end the conflict in Yemen. The talks began in April, a month after China brokered a truce between Saudi and its regional rival, Iran.""China also prioritises stability in the Middle East. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted the Deputy Foreign Ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iran for the first meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran trilateral joint committee on December 15. In light of the ongoing Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, this meeting may have a bearing on the situation,"" Joshi added.Are oil prices likely to flare up?The global oil market initially shrugged off the escalation of the threat posed by Houthis in the Red Sea, but the jitters were felt over the weekend as crude prices climbed by nearly 1 percent.On December 18, the jump in crude prices was sharper at 3 percent, as oil major BP announced temporary suspension of all transits through the waterbody.Brent crude futures surged by $2.33, or 3.1 percent, to $78.88 per barrel by 11:20 a.m. ET (16:20 GMT), whereas, US West Texas Intermediate crude rose $2.27, or 3.2 percent, to $73.68. The jump in prices, however, also factored in lower exports from Russia.""The bad weather in Russia has played a part in the stronger open this morning as has the Houthis attack on ships close to Yemen,"" Reuters quoted IG analyst Tony Sycamore as saying.""BP's decision to halt shipping through the Red Sea may have crystallized concerns for the oil market,"" added Tim Evans, an independent oil analyst at Evans on Energy, while speaking to the news agency. ""The re-routing of tankers does add cost and it does add transit time, so we are seeing... fewer barrels arriving at European refineries in the near term,"" he added.""Deteriorating security for shipping lines in the Red Sea will have some short term impact on crude oil prices but we expect things to settle down soon and expect the crude oil prices to consolidate,"" Kranthi Bathini, Equity Strategist, Wealth Mill Securities, told Moneycontrol."

In Karnataka, the production dipped to 16.95 lakh tonnes from 19.20 lah tonnes, the ISMA data showed.Last week, ISMA projected that the total sugar production in the 2023-24 marketing year is estimated at 325 lakh tonnes without diversion for ethanol. The country had an opening stock of 56 lakh tonnes. The demand is projected at 285 lakh tonnes.To boost domestic supply and control prices, the government has not allowed sugar exports in the current marketing year. India exported 64 lakh tonnes of sugar in the 2022-23 marketing year.Last week, the food ministry allowed the diversion of 17 lakh tonnes of sugar for making ethanol by using sugarcane juice/sugar syrup and B-heavy molasses, a by-product of sweetener."

Since the govt was holding more in some of them, the fund was created to park a part of the excess holding.","The finance ministry is mulling floating a cabinet note for closing the Special National Investment Fund (SNIF) created to meet the minimum public shareholding requirement of 25 percent in some central public sector enterprises (CPSEs).Under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) norms, for a company to remain listed, it needs to have a minimum public shareholding of 25 percent. In these companies, the government holds more than 75 percent and the SNIF was created to divert a part of the excess government stake.Once the special fund is closed, the equity of these CPSEs parked in it can be returned, a senior government official told Moneycontrol on December 18.“Since there were no investors for some CPSEs, a certain percentage of their equity was kept in SNIF. For example, in the case of ITI Ltd, its 7 percent stake is in SNIF. Since the fund was set up by a cabinet decision, it has to be dismantled the same way, and its shares should be returned to the President of India,” the official said.The CPSEs include Andrew Yule & Company Ltd, Fertilizers & Chemicals (Travancore) Ltd, HMT Ltd, ITI Ltd and Scooters India Ltd.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had approved the creation of the SNIF in August 2013.Fund managers were expected to be appointed for SNIF, which was tasked with selling this equity, but nothing has moved forward for so many years, he said.In ITI Ltd, the government has a 90.28 percent stake and thus achieving the minimum public shareholding norm via the minority stake sale route is not possible. “The government will have to offload 15-20 percent to achieve the minimum public shareholding,” he said.Andrew Yule & Company Ltd is under consideration for strategic disinvestment while Scooters India Ltd has been approved for closure. HMT Ltd’s case is before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for restructuring.The finance ministry will look at selling a minority stake in FACT in the next fiscal. “The CPSE is loss-making, but, of late, it has shown some profits by selling some land. Its deadline for achieving minimum public shareholding ends in August 2024, so the finance ministry will seek extension from Sebi,” he said.Hindustan Photo Films Manufacturing Co Ltd, once an iconic name as a Tamil Nadu-based CPSE, has been put on the auction block for closure."

It is at the forefront of fish production. Today, Gujarat is exporting fish worth more than Rs 5,000 crore, taking the state's contribution to 17 per cent of India's total fish exports,"" Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel said at an event organised here recently.""When Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the chief minister of Gujarat, he started the Sagar Khedu Sarvangi Vikas Yojana for the overall development of the fisheries sector, which has been very successful. Today, the blue economy sector of Gujarat is growing very fast,"" Patel said.From fishing operations to processing, the industry plays a crucial role in generating employment and contributing to the state's economy, officials and fishing community members said.Jitu Kahada, a leader of the fishermen community in Gujarat's Gir Somnath district, said the central and state governments have come up with a scheme to provide new gas machines to small traditional fishermen, something that is benefiting them in many ways.As per the data provided by the state government in July this year, the provisional marine fish production in 2022-23 is likely to be 6,97,151 metric tonnes and the inland fish production at 2,07,078 metric tonnes.The government said it has undertaken several initiatives to promote the fisheries sector, such as reduction in the VAT rate on diesel, subsidy on kerosene and petrol, improving infrastructure of small fishing ports, and construction of four new fish harbours at Madhwad, Navabandar, Veraval-II and Sutrapada.The government has also worked to create weather and safety awareness in coastal areas, which has also contributed in improving the fisheries sector.The efforts of the government have led to a change in the lives of the state's fishing community members.According to the state government, the average annual income of a fisherfolk family in Gujarat has seen a steady climb from Rs 6.56 lakh to Rs 10.89 lakh in the last five years.Machine boats by far outstrip the traditional boats, with the former being 28,355 in number compared to 8,625 traditional ones, as per the data provided by the state government.Now, the focus is also to tap into the potential of deep-sea fishing, with both the central and state governments jointly providing support to traditional fishermen in this transition by helping them acquire deep-sea fishing boats, Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying L Murugan said at the Global Fisheries Conference India 2023 organised here recently.This support will be extended through the Centre's schemes, namely the Blue Revolution and the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana, he said.Under the scheme, the government provides up to 60 per cent financial assistance to traditional fishermen to convert their vessels into deep-sea fishing boats. Additionally, loan facilities are also available to facilitate this transformation, stated an official release.Deep-sea fishing is undertaken beyond the limit of territorial waters, which is 12 nautical miles from the shore and within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of 200 nautical miles from the shore. It involves catching fish that live in deep parts of the sea.Deputy Commissioner of Fisheries, Government of India, Sanjay Pandey, said the 'Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna', a fish variety, has an end value of more than USD 4 billion.According to World Bank consultant Dr Arthur Neiland, despite the promising potential of yellowfin and skipjack tunas in India's EEZ, with an estimated harvest of 1,79,000 tonnes, the actual catch is just 25,259 tonnes, indicating the utilisation rate of only 12 per cent.He has emphasised the need for investment from public and private sectors in deep-sea fishing which could generate economic, social and environmental benefits."

While the Modi government has indeed tried to tame these prices, it now needs to do more","As far as battles go, the one India is waging against inflation seems without an end in sight. Not because the authorities are on the wrong track, but because of the nature of the beast: some inflation is necessary, but it needs to be controlled. And that's where the upcoming budget for 2024-25 — the interim as well as the full budget that will most likely be tabled in July 2024 — will play a crucial role.If Narendra Modi's first term as Prime Minister was about establishing a flexible inflation targeting framework and getting markets used to it, the second term has been about testing its strength and principles. Suffice it to say that India's flexible inflation targeting framework — a target of 4 percent with a leeway of 200 basis points on either side — is now battle-hardened, having experienced a once-in-a-century pandemic, the Ukraine in war, and multiple geopolitical conflicts over the course of the last three years.Also Read: RBI doubles down to ward off complacency as long rate pause gets longerWhat the Indian authorities need to do now is to make it ready to face the next big global economic challenge — climate change. Food inflation has always been a key driver of Indian inflation, but the vagaries of weather over the last couple of years have truly highlighted the mountain policymakers face, with unseasonal and uneven spatial and temporal rainfall adding to the annual risk of drought.""Food inflation has a large bearing on headline inflation, given its high weight of 48.6 percent in the CPI,"" said Morgan Stanley economists in their 2024 outlook for India.""Indeed, since the pandemic, food inflation volatility has increased, averaging 6.4 percent between 2020-2023 year-to-date, versus an average of 3.6 percent in the preceding 5 years… As such, supply-side shocks have had a larger impact on headline inflation post pandemic,"" they added.The upcoming budget, then, will be key in designing measures that can smoothen the supply of key food items, which will in turn reduce volatility in food inflation and take India's inflation management to the next level.The big hits1) First things first: the flexible inflation targeting framework — based on which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) must adjust its monetary policy to meet the dual mandate of price stability and growth — has undoubtedly lowered retail inflation in India. From nearly 11 percent in early 2012, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation quickly fell to 6.7 percent in 2014, before averaging 4 percent or lower in 2017, 2018, and 2019.Of course, the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war meant inflation rose above 6 percent in 2020 and 2022, but the course is being corrected. Inflation has hovered between 4 and 6 percent for most of 2023. Compared to a developed economy such as the US — where inflation has been much higher than the target — that is fairly good, as reflected in the fact that the RBI has had to raise the repo rate by only 250 basis points. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve has increased its interest rates by more than 500 basis points since the lows of the pandemic.Also Read: One year gone, one more to go on RBI's post-failure path to 4% inflation2) Inflation, like many other economic forces, depends on what households and other economic agents expect. This makes it crucial for the flexible inflation targeting framework to be credible. And while successful, any failures must be acknowledged. As such, the RBI's admission of failure in late 2022 was important. While the details of the 'letter' it sent to the government remain under wraps, the central bank's corrective action has been visible.3) Perhaps the biggest gain has been team spirit. The government and the RBI have worked together to manage inflation, with the central bank advising the Centre on some of the supply-side measures that need to be taken to cool prices of food items.""Since the government and the central bank each can help achieve the other's objective, coordination can give the best results,"" Ashima Goyal, one of the three external members on the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), said in a paper in November 2023.Also Read: Trade measures can ease food inflation only in short run, says MPC's Shashanka BhideThis bonhomie is in stark contrast to the years under the governorship of Raghuram Rajan and Urjit Patel, when the relationship between Mint Street and North Block was only on paper. The result of this close coordination has been a series of steps taken by the government to help control food inflation — ranging from export bans and duties to changes in stocking limits, among others — with the RBI communicating its suggestions to New Delhi at regular intervals.The big misses1) The RBI is deemed to have failed when average CPI inflation is outside the 2-6 percent tolerance range for three consecutive quarters. But the range is not the target; 4 percent is. And inflation has been above target for 50 consecutive months now. It is expected to spend another couple of quarters above that level, before briefly falling to sub-4 percent — due to a favourable base effect — in the middle of 2024-25. It is not for nothing that the MPC is so focussed on bringing inflation down to the target on a sustained basis.Also Read: All price-setting bodies should internalise 4% inflation target, says MPC's Ashima Goyal""As of now, we are forecasting the July 2024 CPI inflation at 2.8 percent and August 2024 at 3.5 percent. Given that monetary policy is forward looking, the MPC can consider embarking on a rate cut cycle from June 2024, if the inflation trajectory plays out the way we expect,"" said Kaushik Das, Deutsche Bank's chief economist for India and south Asia.2) According to RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, the headline inflation rate is ""vulnerable to recurring and overlapping food price shocks"". This makes solving the food inflation problem a policy imperative — something the RBI has pointed out.""The vulnerability of the economy to recurring vegetable price shocks, especially ahead of and during the monsoon, warrants major reforms in perishable supply chains,"" the central bank said in its State of the Economy article in August 2023. With climate-related events impacting agricultural output severely, it would be a surprise if the upcoming budget does not act on this front.3) A more long-term puzzle is the CPI itself, which is widely seen as being outdated. The statistics ministry is currently conducting the second of its back-to-back consumer expenditure surveys (CES). Once complete, the process of updating the CPI's basket of items and other related issues mean it could take until 2026 for India to get an updated retail inflation series.

In 2024, climate will be on the ballot in a way we’ve rarely seen","As the dust settles on the COP28 climate summit that concluded last week in Dubai, a sobering reality is looming. After the legalistic niceties of environmental diplomacy, the dirtier business of political maneuvering is going to consume the world’s democracies over the next 12 months. In 2024, climate will be on the ballot in a way we’ve rarely seen.Voters in countries representing more than 40 percent of the world’s population — and roughly the same share of emissions — will go to the polls between now and the end of next year. In places, that offers the prospect to break gridlocks on climate and energy policies. In others, it may offer an opportunity for a climate-denying backlash. Far too few places show a decent chance of accelerating the transition to clean energy in the way advocated by the COP28 agreement. Here’s a review of some of the key events.Coal and the PollsTwo of the world’s three biggest democracies face elections in the first half of 2024, but neither offers a strong prospect of change. India and Indonesia have made positive noises lately about switching to clean power. Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has promised 500 gigawatts of renewables by 2030 and President Joko Widodo in Indonesia has signed up for a $20 billion deal to retire the nation’s coal generators early.In each case, however, coal’s deep political, economic and social roots have stymied efforts at reform. Elections aren’t likely to change that dynamic: Modi is well ahead in the polls, while the frontrunner in Jakarta, Prabowo Subianto, is essentially a continuity candidate who’s picked Widodo’s son as his running mate.Emerging Climate LeadersProspects are moderately better in two other leading emerging markets equally wedded to fossil fuels: Mexico and South Africa. In the former, poll-leading Claudia Sheinbaum, a protégé of current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, is a former climate scientist who’s contributed to reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It remains unclear, however, whether that background will lead to a switch from López Obrador’s policies, which have favored state oil company Pemex and a growing dependence on gas imported from the US.In South Africa, the ruling African National Congress faces the first prospect of losing since democratic elections began in 1994. In energy terms, that would almost certainly be good news. The opposition Democratic Alliance’s support of private and solar generation, in contrast to the ANC’s death pact with the corruption-riddled, financially incontinent Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., offers the best prospect for the country to emerge from its current cycle of power cuts and pollution.Polluting AuthoritariansNext is a group of nations where the prospects of real democratic elections seem remote. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, incumbent governments have favored energy policies wedded to imported natural gas. The ripples of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have pushed LNG prices out of reach, leading to power cuts, savage increases in electricity bills, and often violent protests.Jailed opposition leaders in each country have offered the promise of more balanced, cleaner energy policies, but the electoral system remains heavily weighted against them. Elections of sorts will also be held in two of the world’s biggest historic oil exporters — Russia and Venezuela — though the chances of real change in either country seem remote in the extreme.Crouching TigersIn Taiwan, polls appear to be tightening between the incumbent center-left DPP and center-right KMT ahead of the Jan. 13 vote. On paper, the opposition has a mildly more progressive climate policy, since its spurning of the DPP’s anti-nuclear stance gives a lower fossil fuel share in 2030. In practice, it's an open question whether either side will succeed in implementing their green energy policies.South Korea also has legislative ballots in April, but they’re unlikely to break the gridlock that has pitted the unpopular center-right President Yoon Suk Yeol against a more climate-focused assembly for the past two years.Troubled Atlantic WatersThe core developed countries of North America and Europe may be the place where major change is most likely, but in most cases the mood music isn’t positive for climate action. Right-wing, climate denialist parties in Europe such as the Alternative for Germany and Dutch PVV have seen strong performances in recent opinion surveys and votes. Even so, it’s likely the left-right coalition in the European Parliament will remain in control even if such factions make a strong showing in elections due June 9.The UK probably offers the best prospect of major positive change, with opposition leader Keir Starmer well ahead in the polls. He’s promised to turn the country into a “clean energy superpower,” in stark contrast to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has torn up his predecessors’ green-tinged policies.Set against that, however, is the most substantive climate poll of the year, the US presidential election due November 5. Donald Trump’s first term in office failed to break a long-standing trend of falling emissions. Even so, it’s impossible to overstate the contrast a second term would present to the policies of President Joe Biden, who’s promised a zero-carbon grid and mostly electric new car fleet by 2035. In climate diplomacy, where Washington’s on-again, off-again alliance with Beijing has been essential to bringing other nations to the table over the past three years, the return of a more sinophobic administration would be further bad news.Climate in the DoldrumsThat’s not what the world needs right now. Thanks to the rapid greening of the power sectors in China, Europe and the US, and the speedy uptake of electric vehicles, there’s a real prospect that emissions globally peak next year or the year after. To build on those gains and accelerate the path to net zero, however, further political will is needed to ratchet up policies that are still driving the world to more than 2 degrees Celsius of warming. The bonanza of elections due in 2024 is unlikely to deliver that.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication.  Credit: Bloomberg  "
611,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/hong-kong-bankers-uneasy-dance-with-property-tycoons-11918711.html,Hong Kong bankers’ uneasy dance with property tycoons,"December 18, 2023 10:07 AM IST","Next year, close to $25.6 billion of bank loans taken out by Hong Kong’s property developers will be due, and only 15% of them have been — or are close to being — refinanced. Whether banks will continue lending to the business elites has become a hot issue, as commercial real estate woes plague the world’s biggest cities","Hong Kong dazzles with its soaring skyscrapers and swanky shopping malls, and the city has its bankers to thank. Over the years, landlords routinely relied on banks to finance ambitious projects and expected good relationships to remain. But lenders are getting nervous.Next year, close to HK$200 billion ($25.6 billion) of bank loans taken out by Hong Kong’s property developers will be due, and only 15 percent of them have been — or are close to being — refinanced, according to HSBC Holdings Plc estimates.Whether banks will continue lending to the business elites has become a hot issue, as commercial real estate woes plague the world’s biggest cities. In late August, New World Development Co halted a brutal slide in its bond prices after saying it had secured HK$30 billion of low-interest bank loans. The selling had been triggered by a little-known blogger who accused the builder of borrowing at 11 percent to 12 percent in private markets.Already, some lenders are stepping back from smaller, leveraged landlords. In September, Lai Sun Development Co, whose holdings include Ocean Park Marriott Hotel and the Michelin-starred Italian restaurant 8 1⁄2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana, only managed to roll over 80 percent of a HK$3.6 billion 4-year loan, originally taken out to build the Marriott resort. HSBC subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd. and DBS Group Holdings Ltd are no longer on the deal. One month later, just about 75 percent of a HK$4.2 billion loan, backed by Harborside HQ, a grade-A office building in Kowloon Bay, was refinanced.Hong Kong is not back to its old days. In a recent survey, only one in three firms expect rising business turnover next year. Office vacancies in the Central business district are at a record high. On the retail front, tourist arrivals have ramped up to a mere 60 percent of the 2018 level, while residents head north every weekend to dine and shop, taking advantage of mainland China’s deflationary environment. Retail sales are only back to 84 percent of the 2018 level, before the city got hammered by the 2019 pro-democracy movement and then Covid-19.Financial metrics aside, loan officers can tell many of the urban rejuvenation projects are on shaky ground. Hysan Development Co, the biggest landlord in Causeway Bay — once the world’s most expensive shopping district — is working on a mega development in the neighborhood, financed in early 2022 by a green loan worth HK$13 billion. The total cost, including land and construction, is estimated at HK$25 billion, while annual capital expenditure leading to the scheduled 2026 completion is expected to soak up half of Hysan’s operating cash flow.Yet Causeway Bay is a shadow of its glorious past. During a recent visit, I was amazed how empty Hysan Place, a luxury shopping and office center opened just a decade ago, was at 8 p.m. Moody’s Investors Service recently lowered its outlook to negative, citing Hysan’s elevated leverage.Kai Tak, the city’s former commercial airport that is now being developed into a prime business district, is also problematic. The area has undergone several rounds of urban planning revisions. Proposals for a monorail were set aside, while residents fought with the government over plans to build temporary public housing units. These changes were met with anemic sales, and HK$47 billion of project loans, taken out by the likes of Wheelock Properties Ltd., are due over the next two years, according to HSBC.Granted, Hong Kong banks have incentives not to rock the boat. Pulling loans will trigger a market meltdown, top tenants to flee, and possible fire sales and asset write-downs. This will eventually come back to bite the lenders themselves.Case in point: As of the first half, HSBC had $44 billion of commercial real estate loans booked in Hong Kong, including an $8.1 billion exposure to mainland China, which in turn accounted for almost all of the bank’s stage 3 assets, or those that are non-performing and carry substantial credit risks. In other words, HSBC hardly put aside any credit loss provisions for their commercial real estate exposure in Hong Kong.Going into 2024, Hong Kong’s commercial bankers will have an uneasy dance with the property tycoons. They know the numbers don’t work for the city’s ambitious commercial real estate projects, but do they really want to challenge the status quo? The best hope then, is that the Federal Reserve will cut rates aggressively and a flood of liquidity will revive the financial center.Shuli Ren is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

616,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-weekender-jerome-powell-and-the-wizard-of-oz-11911021.html,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender: Jerome Powell and the Wizard of Oz,"December 16, 2023 12:47 PM IST","If Powell succeeds in steering the US economy to a soft landing, it will be a remarkable achievement, and history will know him as the Wizard of the Fed","Dear Reader,Many of you may remember the movie ‘Oz the Great and Powerful’, the 2013 film prequel to Frank L Baum’s timeless classic ‘The Wonderful Wizard of Oz’, a book declared by the Library of Congress as “America’s greatest and best-loved home-grown fairytale”. The film features a small-time magician who gets swept away in a tornado to the fantasy world of Oz, where he teams up with a good witch and the humble Munchkins, Quadlings and Tinkers, to overcome the two evil witches who rule over Emerald City, the capital of Oz. While the masses believe he is the Wizard of Oz, destined to save them, the Good Witch knows he’s just a conjuror. But the magician does not lose heart, and conjures up a storm of illusion, trickery, and fireworks to defeat the evil witches.Fed chair Jerome Powell is no less than a wizard, having beaten the twin witches of inflation and recession, perhaps with a little prodding from good witch Janet Yellen. The markets certainly believe in him—his soothing remarks post the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday has led to a huge rally in equities, in bonds and even in gold. We had written on what the Fed decision meant for investors here and had an FT story (free to read for Moneycontrol Pro subscribers) here. We advised investors on how to proceed now that markets have scaled all-time highs here and here. And we had articles on the investment themes for 2024 from FT and from our in-house independent research team. Note that our MC Pro Research team’s New Year 2023 portfolio has delivered a stunning 48 percent one-year return.Consider the evils Powell had to contend with. The first was the pandemic and the shutdowns, which led to an unprecedented injection of liquidity, both fiscal and monetary, together with a massive disruption of supply lines. When the infection abated and demand came roaring back, the upshot was a burst of inflation, initially misdiagnosed as transient. Then, the Russia-Ukraine war erupted, sending prices skywards and there was no alternative to clamping down hard on inflation. The resulting rapid rise in policy rates then sparked fears of a recession. At the same time, fiscal policy remained very loose, leading to a disconnect with tight monetary policy. Bond yields shot up. Geopolitics queered the pitch even further, raising the spectre of higher defence spending, higher investment spending on account of re-shoring, higher costs as security rather than efficiency dictated investments and trade, and a reversion to protectionism, all of which is conducive to inflation remaining high. And looming behind all this is the daunting prospect of retooling the economy to cope with climate change.Consider the longer-term context. Central banks had kept interest rates low for decades during what was known as The Great Moderation, when inflation was very low, thanks to globalisation. This had led to a bubble in asset prices, a bubble that burst spectacularly in 2008, but was inflated once again after the Global Financial Crisis, as governments and central banks pumped in liquidity. That liquidity was multiplied several times during the pandemic. Naturally, when Powell started raising interest rates, there were dire warnings of a bursting of the bubble and a rash of bankruptcies as firms couldn’t cope with high interest costs. When nothing of the sort happened despite the Fed persisting not only with rate hikes but also with liquidity tightening, pundits started worrying about a recession, but even that much-anticipated event has been indefinitely put off.There were moments when it seemed Powell was losing the plot. Indeed, he may well echo the Wizard of Oz, who said “Frightened? Child, you're talking to a man who's laughed in the face of death, sneered at doom, and chuckled at catastrophe. I was petrified.” But steering the Fed through such turbulent times is no mean feat and we shouldn’t grudge his moment when, with inflation coming down, he has been emboldened to declare victory.To be sure, there has been plenty of commentary accusing Powell of changing his stance too fast. Some have alleged that he has done so keeping the US presidential election in mind. There are lots of memes about Powell declaring ‘’Mission Accomplished” and what a wimp he is compared to the great Volcker. But every central banker knows it is in his power to quell inflation by wrecking the economy. Powell’s genius, if he finally succeeds, will lie in the fact that he has managed to pull off a near-impossible soft landing while getting inflation down, amid some of the worst conditions possible. Volcker couldn’t do that.As for the U-turn by the Fed, Wall Street Journal’s Nick Timiraos, aka the Fed Whisperer, said recently on X: “Based on the Nov CPI and PPI, headline PCE inflation likely declined last month. Core PCE inflation is projected to have been a very mild 0.06% in Nov. This could lower the 12-month core PCE index to 3.1%. The 6-month annualized rate would fall to 1.9%, below the Fed's target.” In other words, it’s a situation ripe for the famous quip often attributed to Keynes, “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”Yes, of course there is much that can still go wrong. The rapid easing of financial conditions brings its own risks. In the movie, when the Wizard of Oz tells the good witch Glinda that he’s not actually a wizard, she says, ""But they don't know that. If you can make them believe, then you're wizard enough. These are desperate times, after all. Can you make them believe?”The markets, though, firmly believe in a soft landing for the US economy. Small wonder they are raising a salute to Powell, on the lines of the Munchkins singing “We welcome you to Munchkin Land’’ from the Wizard of Oz movie. It contains the memorable lines:“Tra la la la la la laFrom now on you'll be historyYou'll be his...You'll be his...You'll be historyAnd we will glorify your nameYou will be a bust...Be a bust...In the Hall of Fame”If Jerome Powell succeeds, it will be an outstanding achievement, and he will go down in history as the Wonderful Wizard of the Fed.Cheers,Manas ChakravartyHere are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets:Stocks Weekly tactical pick, PI Industries,ITC, Inox India IPO, Max Healthcare, Syrma SGS, Protean Tech, Mandatory ACs in trucks: Multiple companies to benefit, DOMS Industries IPO, Is the time ripe to add positions in this chemical stock?, India Shelter Finance IPO Markets Why SEBI’s latest proposal for debt securities can be game-changing2024—the year of elections across the worldThe Fed will have to consider a massive easing of financial conditionsInside Edge MC Pro Inside Edge: Value of power, hidden reserves for poll funding, Godfather’s bargains, warehouse dealsI-bankers play on fund managers' FOMO , HNI’s sweet tooth, IREDA soars Local funds cry foul in bank QIP, wealth god in action at Zee, old wine in new bottleEconomy RBI surveys show disconnect between strong GDP growth and consumer confidence Take the expenditure side of GDP data with spadefuls of saltPro Economic TrackerWhy have jobs as unpaid helpers increased when GDP growth is 7.6 percent?Using risk weights is not without risk for the RBICore retail inflation continues to fall, a comfort for RBIRBI’s disinflationary curve has three distressing wrinklesSmoke and mirrors in industrial production numbersInvestment horizons inch up in emerging marketsCompanies & industries ITC Analyst Day | In a slowing FMCG market, premiumisation is the main strategy in playMaking sense of Mirae Asset’s acquisition of SharekhanBharat ElectronicsCopper faces an uncertain future globallyEthanol’s importance in powering Aatmanirbhar BharatWhy Glencore’s exit from the coal sector is no big dealIndia’s gold rush reflected in jewellery purchasesMultiple woes take fluff off cotton spinning millsFinancial Times China faces the risk of a debt-deflation loopMaking lemonade out of macro lemonsGeopolitics The Eastern Window: China launches new programme to expand influence in Indian Ocean countriesThe fateful triangle that decides the future of oil pricesTech & Startups Start-up Street: Would Omidyar Network’s exit hurt India’s attractiveness for start-ups?EU’s laws for AI could be too late if not too littleTackling the generative AI challenge in cybersecurity for businessesIndia’s tech army is growing but so are the skill gapsRBI's cloud centre for financial data sparks concerns among fintechs and banks Green economy Copout at COP28: Why a consensus in phasing out 'dirty' fuels is so difficultCop 28 plays with words to clinch consensusWhy Cop 28 matters little for NTPC investorsRenewables capacity growth patchyIndia’s main engines of growth need climate protectionCarbon Tax: Will the two-pronged strategy against the EU work?Solar project developers in a sweet spot over steady tariffs, falling costsPersonal Finance Sensex @70,000: How to book profitESG investing: Fund Houses need to be more than accountableStart looking at fixed-income funds a lot more actively now: Anthony Heredia, Mahindra Manulife MFCyclone Michaung: Car insurance policy will cover cost of most damage, but not engine malfunctionPolitics Why are regional parties full of political dynasts?Article 370 verdict: The BJP scores a major ideological victory Others Marketing Musings: The Creator Economy"

Meanwhile, FASTag appears to be on the right lane, with toll collection seeing steady growth. Data from Cloudflare shows that the share of Indians using desktops to get online is rising","Weekly Numerics is a column that features three to five charts based on major events or interesting data points that emerged during the week. Here are some of the key figures of the past seven days.Retail inflation at three-month highIndia’s retail inflation, which is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), saw the highest uptick of the last three months in November, at 5.55 percent. The rise was on the back of an increase in the price of food and beverages during the month. In fact, no other major categories recorded a rise in inflation in November.Food inflation rose to 8.7 percent in November from 6.61 percent a month ago. Together, inflation in food and beverages stood at 8.02 percent in November. Food inflation during the month was mainly driven by a rise in the price of vegetables, fruits, sugar, and pulses.The fuel and light category, meanwhile, recorded a higher deflation of -0.77 percent during the month, from -0.33 percent a month ago. Excluding food, fuel and light, the core index inflation remained low, at 4.11 percent in November, close to the government’s target inflation of 4 percent.Also Read: Vegetables, base effect propel retail inflation to 5.55% in November“Based on commodity prices provided by the Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA), prices of tur dal, urad dal, rice, wheat, milk, and sugar will remain elevated in December. Prices of onions and tomatoes have begun to moderate. Thus, we can expect inflation in December to observe a slight downward shift compared to November,” said a report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).Funds for fighting air pollution remain underutilisedEven though residents of Indian cities struggle to breathe due to air pollution, funds transferred to states for the reduction of air pollution in ‘non-attainment’ cities remain largely underutilised, according to data shared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change in the Lok Sabha.Nearly 62 percent of funds transferred to the 82 non-attainment cities (NAC) across India under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) remain underutilised. Cities are declared non-attainment if over a five-year period, they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM10 particles. The 82 NAC that have been given the target of reducing PM10 levels by around 3-15 percent annually include cities like Delhi, Noida, and Chandigarh.From FY19-20 till date, Nagaland has only utilised Rs 1.62 crore of the total Rs 13.7 crore released to the state under the scheme. This means that as much as 88.18 percent of the funds remain underutilised. States like Rajasthan, Punjab, Karnataka, and Delhi have also seen a majority of the funds being underutilised, as evident from the chart above.Share of Indians using desktops to get online is risingCloudflare, the largest content delivery network (CDN) provider in the world, released its `Year in Review, 2023’ report this week. While the report had several insights on how the internet has evolved over the past year, when it comes to India, one of the interesting aspects is the rising share of desktops in India’s internet traffic.India has seen a surge in internet usage in recent years due to the availability of cheap mobile internet data packs. As such, mobile internet users dominate the country’s internet traffic.However, the latest data from Cloudflare shows that the share of desktops in India’s internet traffic has gone up from 20 percent at the end of December 2022 to more than 36 percent as of December 11, 2023. Corresponding to the rise of desktops, the share of mobile devices has dipped from nearly 80 percent to around 64 percent during the same period.According to a report released by the International Data Corporation in November, India’s PC market grew 14 percent year-on-year (YoY) during the July-September quarter of 2023. This growth was largely driven by the consumer segment, which grew more than 26 percent YoY. Demand from the education sector grew nearly 118 percent on year.Steady increase in toll collection through FASTagThe user fee collected by toll plazas has seen steady growth since the nationwide introduction of FASTag in FY16-17, according to data from the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways presented in the Lok Sabha. The total amount collected through toll plazas increased from nearly Rs 34,000 crore to more than Rs 48,000 crore between FY21-22 and FY22-23.In FY23-24, the total amount collected till November 2023 has already crossed the FY22 total. FASTag, the electronic toll collection system under the National Highways Authority of India, has seen a gradual growth in adoption since its inception. According to official data, as much as 98.9 percent of toll charges on National Highways are collected through FASTags."

It was last up 0.1% at 102.08.Futures markets show investors are now pricing in a 75% chance of a U.S. rate cut in March, according to the CME FedWatch tool. At the start of December, there was around a 40% chance of a cut.Markets expect U.S. rates to fall by 150 basis points by the end of next year, double the Fed’s projections that imply 75 basis points of cuts.The prospect of such a benign rate environment has ignited a rally across risk assets over the past 24 hours, at the expense of the dollar. But the mood may not last, as the U.S. economy is slowing, while inflation is still above target, analysts said.""There was an element of surprise – the extent to which the Fed has gone with giving the market what it wants. Christmas came early,"" City Index strategist Fiona Cincotta said.Financial markets are pricing in a steep drop in rates, but not the economic pain that might come from the kind of slowdown in activity that it may take to bring core inflation back to the Fed’s 2% target.""There is potential for some further U.S. dollar weakness, but I think the concern is that if the Fed does let up too quickly, we can get that return in inflation. It’s a scenario we have seen before and it’s going to weigh on investors’ minds – not immediately, as we’re still in the euphoria of the decision,"" Cincotta said.DIVERGING VIEWSOn Thursday, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England took a different path to the Fed, pushing back against bets on imminent cuts to interest rates and reiterating their focus on the fight against inflation.Investors are nonetheless still betting heavily on rate cuts from both central banks next year.The ECB has more scope than most to ease, according to Pepperstone strategist Chris Weston, given low growth and a rapid decline in inflation.""However, the pushback from (ECB President) Lagarde and co suggests conjecture on the timing of initial easing, perhaps this is a function that its desirable to keep one’s currency strong to limit imported inflation.""Preliminary readings of business activity in France and Germany on Friday showed an unexpected slowdown in the euro zone’s two largest economies this month, sending the euro down by as much as 0.4% to a session low of $1.0946. It was last at $1.0958, still up 2% this week.Sterling eased 0.1% to $1.276, having surged 1.1% to a four-month high of $1.2793 on Thursday after the BoE’s hawkish tilt.Meanwhile, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.16% to 141.60 per dollar, having risen 0.7% to a four-and-a-half-month high of 140.95 on Thursday.The yen is up 2% this week, set for a fifth straight week of gains against the dollar, its longest such stretch since mid-2020."

Current phase of offloading of wheat in the open market started on June 28 this year.To encourage sales of rice, the government has tweaked its policy twice now. It first brought down prices of the rice from Rs 3,100 per quintal to Rs 2,900 per quintal, with a Rs 200 per quintal differential cost covered by the Price Stabilization Fund.ALSO READ: Govt ready to offload extra 2.5 million tons of FCI wheat under OMSS in January-March: Food SecretaryOn December 15, the centre announced that bidders will now be allowed to bid for any quantity of rice from 1 to 2,000 tonnes per auction, up from earlier limit of 10 to 1,000 tonne.“The rice offered under the Central pool is of excellent quality, and traders are invited to actively engage in e-auctions to ensure easy and affordable availability for consumers in the market,” the FCI said in a press statement.Expressing concern over rice inflation, FCI chief Ashok K Meena on Friday also urged traders to buy the grain under the Open Market Sale Scheme (OMSS) to boost domestic availability and contain price rise.""Rice inflation data is slightly a concern. It is at 13 per cent year-on-year, which is a cause of worry. That's why we are selling rice under the OMSS,"" Meena added.To dispel apprehension about the quality of PDS rice, which could be one of the reasons for the poor offtake, the FCI chief, for the first time, served reporters fried rice and kheer (sweet rice) cooked from the PDS rice picked up randomly from its godowns.""The FCI has extremely good quality of rice available. The quality of rice offered under PMGKAY is as good as what you see in the market,"" he said.The only issue is that the PDS rice contains broken rice of up to 25 per cent, otherwise, the quality is good for consumption, he added.According to the FCI chief, more offtake of rice by private traders under the OMSS will improve the availability in the domestic market, thereby bringing down the prices.""Rice stock is healthy. Currently, we have a total of 20 million tonnes of surplus rice, which is more than our requirement for the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) and other welfare schemes,"" he said.About 23.7 million tonnes of rice has been procured in the 2023-24 kharif marketing season, he added.In the case of wheat, retail prices have come under control due to the OMSS sale, along with other measures.Under the OMSS, about 48.12 lakh tonnes of wheat has been sold, so far, since June. In addition to this, 86,084 tonnes of wheat has so far been sold to agencies Nafed, NCCF, and Kendriya Bhandar for converting it into wheat flour and selling at a subsidised rate of Rs 27.50 per kg under the 'Bharat atta' brand.The government has allocated 101.5 lakh tonnes of wheat for the OMSS sale till March 2024. Reserve price for the FAQ wheat and URS wheat has been kept as Rs 2150 per quintal and Rs 2125 per quintal, respectively.Besides the sale of wheat and rice under OMSS, the government has banned the export of wheat and several varieties of rice since last year.(With inputs from PTI)"

The appeal was circulated to WTO members on December 14,"" the WTO has said in a statement.In May, India filed another appeal in a similar dispute case initiated by Japan regarding the tariff treatment that India accords to certain goods in the ICT sector.According to WTO rules, a WTO member or members can file a case in the Geneva-based multilateral body if they feel that a particular trade measure is against the norms of the WTO.The WTO's dispute settlement body (DSB) is one of the important arms. Besides monitoring global exports and import-related rules, it adjudicates trade disputes between the member countries.Bilateral consultation is the first step to resolve a dispute. If both sides are not able to resolve the matter through consultation, either of them can approach for establishment of a dispute settlement panel.The panel's ruling or report can be challenged at the WTO's appellate body.Interestingly, the appellate body is not functioning because of differences among member countries in appointing its members. Several disputes are already pending with this body, which is not functional, as the US has been blocking the appointment of the members.""India hereby notifies DSB of its decision to appeal to the appellate body regarding certain issues of law covered in the panel report and certain legal interpretations developed by the panel in the dispute 'India Tariff Treatment on Certain Goods in the ICT sector',"" the communication submitted by India to the WTO said.India has sought review by the appellate body of the ""errors of law and legal interpretation"" by the panel in its report and findings.The EU, on April 2, 2019, challenged the introduction of import duties by India on a wide range of ICT products, including mobile phones and components, base stations, integrated circuits and optical instruments.The EU had claimed that the measures appear to be inconsistent with certain provisions of the WTO. Later, Chinese Taipei and Japan also joined the dispute.Imports of these nine goods from the EU stood at USD 340.15 million in 2022.With Chinese Taipei, Kumar said, talks are on for a MAS.

Steel players have been raising concerns with various ministries including steel and commerce over the surge in steel imports from select countries like China and Vietnam.The Ministry of Steel on December 13 held a meeting to review the import situation in the country, an industry executive said. The meeting was chaired by steel secretary Nagendra Nath Sinha and attended by representatives of various steel companies. Several ministry officials also participated in the hour-long meeting, he said.""Steel makers informed the ministry that there has been a continuous surge in imports from countries like China and Vietnam despite the same type of steel being available in India,"" a Steel Ministry official said. When asked about the steps, the official said any action can be initiated only after the study of details submitted by the steel industry to the ministry.They have also suggested a few measures including elimination of some duty cuts and tariff rate quota where prescribed limits are set for duty free inbound shipments. The matter would also be discussed with the ministries of Commerce and Finance accordingly.According to SteelMint, steel imports in November were higher at 1.19 million tonnes (MT) against an export of 0.32 MT. In October also, India's steel imports were higher at 0.46 MT in October 2023, compared to exports of 0.24 MT.Last month, Tata Steel CEO and MD T V Narendran had described the situation as a matter of concern as India became the net importer of steel in October."

Without saying if India has resumed purchases from Venezuela, he said some refiners in the country have the capability to process heavy crude oil produced in the Latin American nation.India last imported Venezuelan crude in 2020. The US Treasury Department in October partially lifted sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas sector. The partially lifted sanctions are through a new six-month license authorising transactions in the country's oil and gas sector. The license is to be renewed only if Venezuela can meet commitments leading to fair voting in the next year's presidential election.""We always buy from Venezuela. We have always bought stuff from Venezuela. It's when Venezuela came under sanctions that they were not able to supply,"" Puri told reporters here. He said many refineries, including Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) Paradip refinery in Odisha is capable of processing the heavy Venezuelan oil into fuels such as petrol and diesel.""We will buy,"" he said. Some Indian refiners have already secured supplies from Venezuela. Tapping the Latin American nation will help India further diversify its import basket which currently is heavily dependent on the Middle East and Russia.IOC, HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd (HMEL) and Reliance Industries have reportedly secured 4 million barrels of Venezuelan oil for delivery in February. Venezuela produces around 8,50,000 barrels per day of crude and is targeting to soon reach 1 million bpd. India on the other hand imports 85 per cent of its oil needs.""We are willing to resume with anyone who is not under sanctions,"" Puri said. India consumes more than 5 million barrels of crude oil every day and the demand is only going up. ""So if Venezuelan oil comes into the market, we welcome it. So do all the others,"" he added.The minister also said some Indian money is locked up in Venezuela, referring to ONGC Videsh Ltd's about USD 413 million unpaid dividends from an oilfield in Venezuela. India is hoping to get the stuck money back after the sanction easing.ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), holds a 40 per cent stake in the San Cristobal oilfield in eastern Venezuela's Orinoco Heavy Oil belt. The project is operated jointly by OVL and Petrleos de Venezuela S.A. (PdVSA) – the national oil company of Venezuela.In November 2016, OVL and PdVSA signed two definitive agreements for the redevelopment of the project. The agreements provided a mechanism to liquidate the outstanding dividends of USD 537.63 million due to OVL. OVL agreed to provide loans of up to USD 60 million for implementing the remediation plan of the project. Under the loan arrangement, it provided a loan of USD 17.11 million and received part of the outstanding dividend amounting to USD 124.81 million as of March 31, 2023, the source said, adding that due to sanctions, these agreements had come to a standstill and balance dividend of USD 412.82 million was pending.The easing of sanctions will help get back the stuck dividends, officials said. Also, the company is hoping to sell its share of oil from the field, which was 0.61 million tonnes in 2022-23, to whoever offers the best price."

Such a demand shock when input costs are rising and there are few jobs for the taking doesn’t make sense","The newly formed government of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, in its inaugural cabinet meeting, has decided to ban the sale of meat, fish and eggs in the open.Addressing a press conference in Bhopal, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav emphasised the strict adherence to the guidelines issued by the Government of India concerning the sale of these food items. The supporters of the government’s move would want to argue that it is aimed at addressing public health concerns and ensuring food safety.Nevertheless, the move is not well-thought through and may have unintended consequences for which the government may not be prepared for.Precarious Livelihoods, IndustryAs of now it’s not clear what exactly the open sale will mean. However, assuming the ban also includes roadside vendors who grill chicken or meat products in the open like butchers and hawkers who don’t sell from proper shops, the ban will aggravate the problem of unemployment.The MP government recently informed the state’s legislature that there were as many as 39 lakh registered unemployed youths in Madhya Pradesh. In the last three years, only 21 youths were able to get government jobs in this industrially and economically laggard state wherein 60 percent (against the national average of 45 percent) of the workforce depend upon agriculture and allied sector which accounts for 44 percent of the state’s GDP (against the national average of 18 percent or so).Except for a few large players such as SKM Egg products, the Indian poultry industry remains largely unorganised and is dominated by smaller players with localised presence. From the supply side, the poultry industry is already troubled by the surge in poultry feeds prices. That in turn is prompted by a surge in the prices of raw material prices. For instance, in the last 12-14 months, the price of corn has shot up from Rs 12 a kilogram to Rs 23 a kilogram.With FCI (Food Corporation of India) stopping the sale of broken rice to grain-based distilleries for ethanol production, they are looking at using corn as a feedstock. If that happens, corn prices will further rise. Soybean’s prices too have gone up substantially in this period. With China likely to import 25 percent more soymeal in 2023/24, according to the latest USDA report (Dec 2023)  its prices are likely to go up further in the near future.Economic Impact Of The BanThe ban on the open sale of meat and eggs is going to hit poultry firms from the demand side thereby adversely affecting their sales revenues and may lead to job cuts in the sector.Similarly, for livestock farmers, the ban on the open sale of meat could reduce demand for livestock, impacting the income of farmers. Street vendors involved in selling meat, eggs, and fish in the open may face an immediate loss of income. This can lead to financial hardships for these small-scale entrepreneurs who depend on daily sales of their produce for their livelihoods.Improving food safety and hygiene is a desirable goal and should be  pursued.  However, it shouldn't be limited to non-vegetarian food items only. Making and selling pakoras and samosas in the open is equally unhygienic and unsafe to eat. Besides, given the worsening employment situation in the state of MP and the country in general, the implications of a ban on the sale of meat and poultry products for jobs can't and shouldn't be wished away.With no alternative source of livelihood to fall back for poultry producers and unorganised sellers, such bans will only increase harassment of roadside vendors and hawkers by police and   enforcement agencies for extracting bribes.The government should instead focus on larger organised players who are selling nicely packed but sugar, salt and fat heavy junks in the form of breakfast cereals, sweets and snacks. Besides those who are selling food items in shops may not be as hygienic as  one  tends to believe.Unless the intent is to influence dietary habits of the citizens, the government’s move to ban the open sale of meat and poultry products doesn't make sense. What’s really needed is a holistic approach to food safety and not a populist knee jerk reaction.Prerna Sharma Singh is a director on the board of Indonomics Consulting Private Limited, a policy research and advisory startup, and heads its agriculture, food and retail practice.

Additionally, due to winter, refiners will purchase less,"" the dealer said.India's palm oil imports usually moderate during winter months as the tropical oil solidifies at lower temperatures."

The contract with Infosys for providing technology support for GST comes to an end from September 30, 2024.“We have started work on the request for proposal. Target is that by March we should be able to come out with it. Till now it has been a managed service provider model with Infosys, wherein the company is handling both hardware and software requirements.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had asked Infosys to boost GSTN capacities to handle the heavy traffic on the GST portal. The government had to even extend the deadline for filing GST returns to resolve the technical bug around issues including login errors, auto logouts and delays in receiving on-time passwords (OTPs).""The flip side of having two consultants is that both vendors may have issues and blame each other for any shortcomings.

Over the last five years, the government has spent Rs 1,700 crore on Infosys on the GST technology support. Infosys won the Rs 1,380 crore contract to build and maintain the IT backbone for the GST regime in 2015.Since there will be no restrictions on global companies bidding for the contract, the government is hoping there may be some interested multi-national corporations (MNCs). “Since the basic complications during the initial years of GST are over, there will be only some additions and deletions in the system,” the official said. E-invoicing technology support will be the focus for the government going ahead.If needed, the government is also open to extending the Infosys contract by another six months, he added."

When can investors expect inflation to fall and central banks to ease the pressure on interest rates? This was the question that dominated stock markets in the US, UK and eurozone in 2023.

After the US Federal Reserve raised rates to tackle soaring inflation, investors agonised over whether the Fed had done enough to tame rising prices. Or had it, in fact, overdone its approach, risking a painful recession?

Meanwhile, Delhi is ahead on spending on public health and education.","When it comes to government finances, much of the public attention is focussed on the Centre – understandably so, given the large sums of money involved. The fiscal math of state governments is more difficult to get around – but equally important – considering that states present their budgets over several months.So it is rather convenient when the Reserve Bank of India publishes its annual study of state budgets. Here, Moneycontrol looks at the central bank's latest such study of the budgets for 2023-24 and examines key aspects of state finances through five charts.Footing the subsidy billA series of state elections were decided a couple of weeks ago and a few more will go to the polls around the time of the Lok Sabha elections. And freebies have re-emerged as a key electoral issue in state elections.The problem, however, is that there is no legal definition of freebies. Secondly, political parties don't estimate how much their poll promises will cost.Also Read: Poll panel should ask parties to estimate cost of freebies, says MPC's Ashima GoyalPerhaps the next best number – one that, admittedly, must be taken with a fair share of salt – is that of subsidies. Of course, there is no point comparing which state shells out the most on subsidies, given the varying sizes of states. Instead, we look at the revised estimates for subsidies in 2022-23 as a percentage of each state's State Domestic Product (SDP).As per the data, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu were comfortably at the top of the pile, each having spent more than 5 percent of their SDP on subsidies in 2022-23. Rounding off the top five are Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar.A couple of caveats here: one, Maharashtra – whose subsidy bill, at Rs 28,386 crore, was the highest in 2019-20 – has not provided data since then. Two, one must not conflate subsidies with freebies as not all subsidies are bad or distortionary.Human developmentStates, often more than the Centre, are responsible for investments into the lives of the public. These include medical and public health, family welfare, water supply, and sanitation.Unsurprisingly, the National Capital Territory of Delhi leads the pile comfortably when it comes to budgeted spending on these heads in 2023-24 as a percentage of the state's total expenditure. At just over a fifth of its total expenditure, the Delhi government is head and shoulders above the all-state average of 9 percent. A slew of smaller states – also well above the average – are close behind.While these expenses are health related, a key component of human development is education. Delhi leads the way again in this category, with 21 percent of its expenditure for 2023-24 going on education – significantly higher than the all-state average of 13.3 percent.In this category, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, and Assam are in the 16-18 percent range.Committed expenditureA key constraint for both the Centre and the states is committed expenditure – things they must spend on to ensure the wheels don't fall off. These include servicing debt (interest payments) and paying wages to government employees. The higher these expenses, fewer the resources left to spend on developmental items.According to the RBI data, topping the list of the highest proportion of revenue receipts spent on interest payments, salaries and wages, and operations and maintenance is the tiny northeastern state of Mizoram at a mind-boggling 95 percent. While it is perhaps not fair to single out Mizoram because its size makes it difficult for it to generate revenue, the rest of the top-five don't have the same excuse.Assam comes in at sixth, with its expenditure on interest payments and salaries and wages in 2023-24 accounting for 57 percent of its total revenue receipts, even with data for spending on operations and maintenance unavailable. Many states, including Goa, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Tripura, and West Bengal, did not furnish complete data to the RBI.Another crucial head of committed expenditure, pensions, is not mentioned even though it is a popular electoral tool to woo voters – and has the potential to destabilise states' finances. But more on that here.A fine balanceInevitably, the bottom line always comes down to the sustainability of the finances of state governments. And the legal marker for this is the annual fiscal deficit of 3 percent of each state's SDP. States' fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratios as per 2023-24 budgets (Source: RBI)As shown above, the number of states close to or under the 3 percent threshold is greatly exceeded by those above it. According to the RBI, the states need to address ""several challenges to fiscal sustainability"" in the medium term, including pushing the pedal on asset monetisation to raise non-tax revenue, improvement in tax administration, and prevention of illegal mining by mineral-rich states.Also Read: India must lower fiscal deficit 'a lot more' to get a higher rating, says S&POn the expenditure side, the Indian central bank sounded a more dire warning.""…some States have budgeted for fiscal deficits exceeding 4 percent of GSDP in 2023-24 as against the all-India average of 3.1 percent,"" the RBI noted. ""Any further provision of non-merit goods and services, subsidies, transfers, and guarantees will render their fiscal situation precarious and disrupt the overall fiscal consolidation achieved in the last two years.""Clearly, the states have their task cut out."

It's when Venezuela came under sanctions that they were not able to supply,"" Puri told reporters on December 15.'We are willing to resume (oil purchases) with anyone who is not under sanctions,"" Puri added.The petroleum minister's comments come after the US eased its sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector in October, with India having last imported crude oil from the South American nation in 2020.In 2019-20, India imported $6.03 billion worth of petroleum oil from Venezuela - down 17 percent from 2018-19 - which made up 99.5 percent of India's total imports from the country.The lifting of the sanctions will come as a relief of sorts to India, with the country having paid an average price of $84.20 per barrel for Russian oil in October – significantly higher than the $60 price cap set by G7 bloc.With global commodity prices, including those of oil, surging following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, India has taken advantage of cheaper Russian oil - offered at a discount due to sanctions imposed by developed countries on the warring nation - and sharply increased its imports from the country. However, the increase in price being paid for Russian oil has resulted in India's crude oil imports from the country falling for the second consecutive month in November. According to energy cargo tracker Vortexa, India imported 1.48 million barrels per day in November from Russia, down from 1.55 million barrels per day in October.Puri argued that many Indian refineries can use heavy Venezuelan oil. As such, they would make such purchases.""We are in a situation where we are utilising 5 million barrels of crude oil in a day. And our growth is going up. So if Venezuelan oil comes on the market, we welcome it,"" the minister said."

From return to ecology friendly farming practices to farmer-consumer cooperatives and technologies like solar-based vegetable dehydrating, there is much work to be done to stabilise prices, ensure food security, and keeping farmers and consumers happy","The cat is out of the bag, especially after the Reserve Bank of India in clear letters pointed to food inflation as a major reason for higher inflation.But this is not the first time that food inflation has hit India. Recall 2015 when dal prices shot up. Arhar was being sold for over Rs 200/kg. Then again in 2016, food inflation was at an all time high. Onion to potatoes all prices were volatile and hence the government started the Operation Greens and the TOP (tomato, onion, potato) scheme for market stabilisation.This scheme provided freight and storage subsidies so that a viable infrastructure can be built bolstering the supply chain for these vegetables. But soon after, in 2019, despite government supply measures prices of onions jumped to a 20-month high.Constant Inflationary Pressures2020 was no different as food price inflation increased and added additional pressure on the inflation graph. In 2021 and 2022, food prices were wobbling due to dampened harvests and volatile prices from agri inputs to fuel. And finally our food economy took the biggest hit with the recent hyper food inflation in vegetables pushing prices of tomatoes beyond 200/kg and a sharp increase in other vegetables too.Export bans, stockpiling limits and weekly food stock reporting all went against the farm law logic, yet have been used by the government to keep crop produce within the country to stabilise the food market. NAFED and other government agencies have also been used to release additional food stocks, yet prices refuse to stabilise or come down.Recently, official statements from the food bureaucracy promised that onion prices will be 40/kg by January 2024. One hopes that the ministry is right but if not this game will have many losers including the farmers, consumers and the government, because these stakeholders aren’t getting fair prices, timely nutrition and a healthy citizenry.Even from small traders to food exporters all are quietly suffering because of the government’s ever-changing food policies. What all these events signify is the government’s food policy and remedial measures are not working as desired. In fact, forces of food inflation backed by agrarian distress is overpowering our state planning. And one hopes that the government machinery realises that a trajectory change is required.But should this inflationary pressure be used to remodel our food system? One hopes that the government does start shifting gears beginning by taking a step away from industrial agriculture towards regenerative agriculture. One or two states can’t take the burden of food production anymore.  Erratic weather is tearing into our usual growing seasons and hence we need to create regional food production hubs using sustainable agricultural methods so that sub-regions can take care of themselves.Ways To Improve Food AvailabilityIf farmers and consumers are linked through direct marketing and supported by transport and storage subsidies, then the government can kill three birds with one policy stone. First will be ecological farming returning to regions, reduced fertiliser/ pesticide use. Second, farmers and consumers both can get fair prices and also the quality of food will be better. The third will be because these farmer-consumer cooperatives will regulate supply as per demand and despite global or national prices fluctuating they will ensure a steady supply to their regions. These cooperatives can also supply to local schools for the mid-day meal schemes.At a larger level, regional cooperatives can place orders or barter with other cooperatives for their excess food supplies. This is a simple way of checking hyper food inflation events and also developing metrics for gauging year round demand for various fruits and vegetables.In the short term, the government should announce bonuses for wheat and mustard backed by government procurement quotas through NAFED and FCI. These procurement centres with MSP prices should be spread across regions so farmers across the country can provide for the food security and also get a fair price.To prepare for the worst case, India should also consider having a grain and agri treaty with Russia.Lastly, we need to develop solar-based vegetable dehydrating infrastructure especially in the vegetables-growing cluster in the country to prevent waste and preserve vegetables by drying them out. These dried vegetables don’t lose much nutrition and can be used in mid-day meals and the food processing industry. Traditionally many regions around the country had used dehydrated vegetables, we need to reclaim this tradition to save wastage and also to bolster the food security ecologically. Government may provide financial assistance to women’s SHGs to develop cottage vegetable drying solar units.Indra Shekhar Singh is an independent agri-policy analyst and writer.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Fed chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee finally delivered on the much-awaited pivot in the policy rate.But the Fed Funds market was already sceptical of Powell’s rather dubious ‘’higher-for-longer’’ stance and had pencilled in rate cuts amounting to 100 basis points by December 2024, even before the latest FOMC announcement. In other words, despite the September 2023 FOMC members’ median estimate of the target Fed Funds rate being 5.1 percent by December 2024, the Fed Funds futures market, as on 6th December 2023, was pricing in the probability of the policy rate being 400-425 basis points or lower in December 2024 (Please see accompanying chart).The FOMC now says its median estimate for the Fed Funds Futures rate in December 2024 is 4.6 percent, which implies 75 basis points of rate cuts. That is still higher than the 4-4.25 percent priced in before the Fed announcement on 6th December.A section of the market, looking at the runaway rallies in the equity and bond markets and the consequent easing of financial conditions, had expected the Fed to sound hawkish, which is why there was a bit of a pullback in the Fed Funds futures market a day before the announcement. But the probability was still a huge 76.7 percent that the Fed would be forced to cut its policy rate to 4.5 percent or below by December 2024. So, most of the lower median estimate of the Fed Funds rate had already been priced in.But the chart shows that, as soon as the FOMC acknowledged that the market was right, the market wanted more. After the FOMC announcement, the Fed Funds futures market now pencils in a 73 percent probability that the Fed Funds futures rate will be 375-400 basis points or below by December 2024. In short, it’s now expecting rate cuts of 150 basis points or more in 2024. The more the Fed gives, the more the market wants.Fed chair Powell has fanned the market fires. So far, the assumption was that the Fed would cut rates only if a recession loomed ahead. But Powell now says the Fed doesn’t need a recession to cut rates. “It could just be a sign that the economy is normalizing and doesn't need the tight policy,” he said. Even a soft landing would lead to lower rates—it’s Goldilocks on steroids for the markets.The markets are also pricing in faster rate cuts. They now expect a rate cut of 25 basis points by the FOMC as early as March 2024. Before the latest FOMC announcement, the betting was that the first rate-cut would happen in May—now there’s a 70 percent probability that the Fed Funds rate would be cut to 500-525 basis points in March and a 17 percent probability it would be cut to 475-500 basis points then.To be sure, part of the rally was on account of the bears being caught unawares and the consequent short covering.

Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation was at -0.52 percent in October 2023 and 6.12 percent in November 2022.At 0.26 percent, the latest wholesale inflation print is the highest in eight months.The WPI data comes two days after the statistics ministry said the headline retail inflation rose to a three-month high of 5.55 percent in November, still down 189 basis points from the 15-month high of 7.44 percent in July. Wholesale inflation has zoomed 149 basis points over the same period.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Like the Consumer Price Index, the WPI too rose by 0.5 percent month-on-month in November, driven by a 1.9 percent rise in the food index. Within food, the biggest push, as expected, came from vegetables, with a 16.5 percent month-on-month surge in price index, thanks to a 41.3 percent jump in the index of onions. Other food items to register a sequential increase in price included fruits (up 1.7 percent), wheat (1.6 percent), and pulses (1.4 percent), jacking up the wholesale food inflation to 4.69 percent in November from 1.07 percent in October.At the same time, prices of manufactured products changed little, with their index rising a mere 0.1 percent MoM. Keeping manufactured products' inflation in check was price weakness in key raw materials, with the price index for semi-finished steel down 1.5 percent MoM and that of basic metals 0.9 percent lower compared to October. Even among finished items, leather and related products saw their prices decline by 0.6 percent MoM, while those of pharma and rubber and plastic products were down 0.3-0.4 percent.Prices of manufactured products, which make up nearly two-thirds of the WPI basket, have been steady for three months in a row now.Despite rising above zero in November, average WPI inflation for the first eight months of 2023-24 remains in the negative territory, standing at -1.33 percent. And while it is expected to rise further in the coming months, economists widely see it averaging around 1 percent for the year as a whole. This could spell trouble for the country's nominal GDP growth, which the 2023-24 Budget assumed would be 10.5 percent while making its tax collection and other forecasts.As per latest data, nominal GDP growth in the first half of 2023-24 was just 8.6 percent.However, Chief Economic Advisor V Anantha Nageswaran has suggested that it is possible India's is underestimating its GDP growth rate. ""It is a theoretical possibility that when you have a tax buoyancy which is as high as 1.9 or close to 2, which is historically unprecedented, then it is quite possible that we are not measuring the economy's underlying momentum and activity and dynamism as we should be,"" Nageswaran had said on November 30."

Under GST, an Indian entity and its head office are treated as separate units. This means transactions between them come under the purview of the tax regime, even if they are without consideration.Many foreign airlines have been under investigation on this count. According to the GST department, there has been deemed supply of services and it was found that their India-specific services were not billed here, which led to the tax notices being issued.Finnair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Qatar Airways, Virgin Atlantic and British Airways confirmed they have received the notices from the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI). The GST authorities also sent notices to Etihad, Emirates, Saudi Airlines, Air Arabia, Oman Air, and Kuwait Airways.Senior officials from a European carrier told Moneycontrol that they are likely to pay the fines to the DGGI but said that imposing import tax under GST on airlines is ambiguous under the current framework of Indian taxation.Ambiguous issue""Taxability and valuation of a foreign public service entity (like an airline) cross charges has been a vexed issue under GST with ambiguity continuing on whether there is an actual provision of service/supply to trigger GST, potential arguments on nil valuation,"" the official said.Another official from a foreign carrier said most airlines are likely to claim tax rebates in their own countries on the expenses incurred due to the DGGI's notices and are not likely to contest the charges.“Airlines need to establish the place of supply with respect to the charges in question and determine the applicability of GST on each item separately,” Manish Mishra, a partner at JSA Advocates & Solicitors, told Moneycontrol. “In respect of supply of goods or equipment supplied/leased outside India, it can be argued that the same should not be leviable to GST as these supplies have taken place outside India. With regard to charges towards services, the incidence of GST would depend upon the specific nature of service and the manner in which the same is discharged.”However, the issue remains contentious and would get resolved only at higher levels of adjudication, he said.“In GST, the point of supply is the point of taxation. If the point of supply is abroad, payment is on a reverse-charge mechanism. If the airline is headquartered abroad and has delivered services in India, taxability is here,” a senior government official had earlier told Moneycontrol.Most airlines declined to comment on the matter officially, saying they always operate in accordance with laws, rules, and regulations and they are prepared to collaborate with the authorities to ensure compliance, if necessary.“Action by DGGI is well within the framework of GST. Though in all probability, action will be decriminalised and converted into payment of dues with nominal penalty,” aviation expert Vipul Saxena told Moneycontrol.This makes the process compliant with the orders without impacting the relationships between India and the countries to which these airlines belong, Saxena said. While Indian carriers may get a cost advantage over foreign airlines in India, airline companies with offices in other countries too have similar tax obligations."

This is easier said than done","The recent election results proved the futility of the roll-back of the pension reforms for government employees, in electoral politics. Congress lost both Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, despite reintroducing the defined-benefit, pay commission-linked, old pension scheme (OPS). Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP opposed the move and they won both states.Ideally, that should create a consensus among political parties to avoid this suicidal path. Anticipatedly, AAP and, Congress may now soft pedal on implementing the election promise for OPS in Punjab and Karnataka, respectively.But that may not be sufficient to seal the deal for the market-linked, defined-contribution-based National Pension System (NPS), introduced in 2004.Not An Easy TaskThe primary task is to take the four states – Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Himachal – which implemented OPS between 2022 and 2023, back to NPS. This is theoretically easy.With NPS infrastructure in place and the legacy contributions locked with the central authorities; pension accounts can go live by a simple executive order. States can deposit the contributions for the paused period to the National Security Depository Limited (NSDL) to square up the accounts.However, in practice, any such reversal wouldn’t be easy, mostly for political reasons.Both Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh rolled back pension reforms at the beginning of the 2022-23 fiscal year. Over the last one and a half years, they expanded OPS benefits to lakhs of employees in quasi-government organisations like universities, corporations, boards etc.In Rajasthan over 1400 employees who joined service after 2004 (when NPS came into effect) and retired after April 2022 (when the state exited NPS), were granted pension under OPS. Also, some post-2004 recruits, who retired between 2004 and 2022, had refunded the NPS benefits to avail of OPS.It means the lobby for OPS is now much bigger than it was, in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Naturally, return to market-linked reforms will face maximum resistance from both the states.Jharkhand implemented the scheme in October 2022. Himachal did so early this year. So, they may face fewer problems in re-migrating to NPS. Punjab notified the return to OPS but did not notify the rules. Karnataka is yet to notify rollback of pension reforms. These two states are, therefore, saved from the destruction.Read | RBI Bulletin: Shift to OPS by states would be ‘fiscally unsustainable’, big step back It is not clear, how the dice will roll. However, one can safely assume that it would be extremely courageous even for the new BJP governments in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to announce re-migration to NPS, on their own, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election.Reform OpportunityIdeally, everyone should wait for a divine intervention from the Centre, which will have its own set of complications and opportunities, to clear the mess.For the federal government, the task at hand is to ensure that such a circus is not repeated any time in the future. The precedence created by Congress and followed by AAP is dangerous for the fiscal reforms and may be revived with the change in government.It is also necessary to force states like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu to undergo pension reforms. According to a recent RTI reply by the Pension Fund Regulatory and the Development Authority (PFRDA), both states notified NPS only for all India services.Tamil Nadu was the first state to get out of OPS around 2003, during the Jaylalitha rule. In those days, NPS architecture was under construction and, states were allowed to keep the employees’ and employer’s contributions in personal deposit (PD) funds in the treasuries.After the creation of due infrastructure, by the Manmohan Singh government, states transferred the funds to National Pension System Trust for investments in market-linked instruments.Tamil Nadu avoided joining the Trust-operated investment activities. They used the pension funds to boost their cash flow.Also Read: National Pension System: Not just a great retirement tool, it offers tax benefits tooAccording to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), as of 2021-22, the funds retained by Tamil Nadu earned four to five percent interest from LIC and treasury bills. In comparison, professionally driven NPS earned an average of 9.5-10 percent.The CAG held that Tamil Nadu had to pay 2.2 percent from its pocket to pay general provident fund comparable return (7.1 percent) to employees. To look at it from the state government's perspective, they enjoyed access to cash at rock bottom interest.Employees are the ultimate losers as they will go home with lower returns than available through market investments. This is a blatant misuse of power by the state to cover up its poor finances.West Bengal is the worst. The Marxist government of the past denied front-ending pension expenditure and bringing accounts in order. Leftist employee associations were happy to get OPS. The state kept delaying the release of dearness allowances to restrict running expenditures. Employees missed the best of either side.The Mamata Banerjee government follows the same policy. To add, the state has almost stopped recruitment. The vacancies are filled by lowly paid contractual staff (who are bound to be more loyal to the party). Even the sensitive home department is full of them.There are also anomalies in pension contributions. Many states, like Rajasthan, did not abide by the central formula for 14 percent contribution by the state and 10 percent by the employees. Media reports claim many states are irregular in depositing contributions to the NPS authorities.Who Will Bell The Cat?To cut the long story short, the NPS story is in a mess. While hapless state employees blame it on the ‘market’ for insufficient returns, which keeps the myth of OPS alive, the truth might be lying elsewhere.The irresponsible act of Congress and other parties in the (now-belied) hope for votes, not only added to the mess but, also created an opportunity for a goods and services tax (GST) like reform to strengthen the decades-old fiscal and administrative reforms agenda.OPS is no solution. It’s a threat to the nation's fiscal stability. But, NPS must be strengthened and should be made mandatory. The question is who will bell the cat and when?Pratim Ranjan Bose is an independent columnist, researcher, and consultant. His X handle is @pratimbose.

Those envisioned rate cuts — which wouldn't likely begin until the second half of 2024 — suggest that the officials think high borrowing rates will still be needed for much of next year to further slow spending and inflation.In a statement it issued after its 19-member policy committee met Wednesday, the Fed said “inflation has eased over the past year but remains elevated.” It was the first time since inflation first spiked in 2021 that the Fed has formally acknowledged progress in its fight against accelerating prices. It also provided a hint that its rate-cut efforts may be over, saying it is considering whether “any additional” hikes are needed.The Fed kept its benchmark rate at about 5.4%, its highest level in 22 years, a rate that has led to much higher costs for mortgages, auto loans, business borrowing and many other forms of credit. Higher mortgage rates have sharply reduced home sales. Spending on appliances and other expensive goods that people often buy on credit has also declined.Also Read: US stocks rise, yields sink after Fed indicates rate cuts are comingSo far, the Fed has achieved what few observers had thought possible a year ago: Inflation has tumbled without an accompanying surge in unemployment or a recession, which typically coincide with a central bank’s efforts to cool the economy and curb inflation. Though inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, it has declined faster than Fed officials had expected, allowing them to keep rates unchanged and wait to see if price increases continue to ease.At the same time, the government’s latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation in some areas, particularly health care, apartment rents, restaurant meals and other services, remains persistently high, one reason why Fed Chair Jerome Powell is reluctant to signal that policymakers are prepared to cut rates anytime soon.On Wednesday, the Fed’s quarterly economic projections showed that its officials envision a “soft landing” for the economy, in which inflation would continue its decline toward the central bank’s 2% target without causing a steep downturn. The forecasts showed that the policymakers expect to cut their benchmark rate to 4.6% by the end of 2024 — three quarter-point reductions from its current level.A sharp economic slowdown could prompt even faster rate reductions. So far, though, there is no sign that a downturn is imminent.In its quarterly projections, the Fed's policymakers now expect “core” inflation, according to its preferred measure, to fall to just 2.4% by the end of 2024, down from a 2.6% forecast in September. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, is considered a better gauge to inflation’s future path.The policymakers foresee unemployment rising to 4.1% next year, from its current 3.7%, which would still be a low level historically. They project that the economy will expand at a modest 1.4% next year and 1.8% in 2025.Interest rate cuts by the Fed, whenever they happen, would reduce borrowing costs across the economy. Stock prices could rise, too, though share prices have already rallied in expectation of rate cuts, potentially limiting any further increases.Powell, though, has recently downplayed the idea that rate reductions are nearing. He hasn’t yet even signaled that the Fed is conclusively done with its hikes.One reason the Fed might be able to cut rates next year, even if the economy plows ahead, would be if inflation kept falling, as expected. A steady slowdown in price increases would have the effect of raising inflation-adjusted interest rates, thereby making borrowing costs higher than the Fed intends. Reducing rates, in this scenario, would simply keep inflation-adjusted borrowing costs from rising.Recent economic data have modestly cooled financial markets’ expectations for early rate cuts. Last week’s jobs report for November showed that the unemployment rate fell to 3.7%, near a half-century low, down from 3.9% as businesses engaged in solid hiring. Such a low unemployment rate could force companies to keep raising pay to find and retain workers, which would fuel inflationary pressures.And consumer prices were mostly unchanged last month, the government said Tuesday, suggesting that while inflation is likely headed back to the Fed’s 2% target, it might take longer than optimists expect. The central bank, as a result, could opt to keep rates at their current level to try to ensure that prices resume their downward path.The Fed is the first of several major central banks to meet this week, with others also expected to keep their rates on hold. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England will decide on their next moves Thursday."

The group projects a 2.0 million bpd, year-on-year, increase in the non-OECD with China and the Middle East leading the way, supported by other Asia and India.“This forecast centres on sustained economic and petrochemical activity across major consumer nations, which fosters demand for transportation fuels and distillates in 2024,” the report said.OPEC said it remains cautiously optimistic about the fundamental factors affecting oil market dynamics in 2024. “In response to the broad spectrum of uncertainties that continues to surround the global oil market, many countries participating in DoC (Declaration of Cooperation) announced in November 2023 additional voluntary adjustments in 1Q24 to help maintain stability and balance in global oil markets,” it added.In December, OPEC and its allies, commonly known as OPEC+, voluntarily agreed on a fresh production cut of nearly 1 million bpd by early 2024, taking the total reduction above 2.2 million bpd or about 2 percent of the world supply, to support crude prices.OPEC said countries participating in DoC will continue on these commitments to achieve and sustain a stable oil market and provide long-term guidance for the market.For oil products, OPEC expects transportation fuels such as jet/kerosene, gasoline, and diesel to drive demand growth. Petrochemical feedstock is also expected to support oil demand in the non-OECD region, it added.OPEC, however, warned that the forecast is subject to global economic developments, particularly uncertainties about the OECD’s manufacturing and petrochemical sectors."

It is built on common ground. It is strengthened by inclusivity. And it is reinforced by collaboration,” Jaber said.Talking about the many firsts that COP28 managed to achieve, Al Jaber said, “A global goal to triple renewables and double energy efficiency. Declarations on agriculture, food and health. Many more oil and gas companies stepping up for the first time on methane and emissions. And now we have language on fossil fuels in our final agreement. All of these are world firsts.”Moneycontrol gives you a wrap of the biggest decisions approved during this year’s COP28.Transition away from fossil fuels: After two weeks of hard-fought negotiations, representatives from nearly 200 countries today agreed to begin reducing global consumption of fossil fuels to avert the worst of climate change. This is the most important achievement of COP28 since no previous COP text has mentioned moving away from oil and gas, the fuels that have underpinned the global economy for decades. “Transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science,” read the Global Stocktake (GST) text. Unlike the mention of coal, the text, however, had no reference to oil and gas.Triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030: At least 117 countries at COP28 agreed to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. The countries signed the “Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge” under which they have to double the global average annual rate of energy efficiency improvements from around 2 percent to over 4 percent every year until 2030.Loss and damage fund: On the first day of COP28 itself countries agreed to formally establish a loss and damage fund to support vulnerable countries dealing with the effects of climate change. The developed countries, most responsible for the climate emergency, have pledged a combined total of at least $700 million to the loss and damage fund during COP28.Phase-down of unabated coal: The final COP28 text called for “accelerating efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power”. While the previous draft text also talked about limiting new coal plants, the same was deleted in the final document. This weakened language of coal phase-down would act in favour of India, which is faced with the challenge of meeting an ever-increasing power demand while keeping electricity accessible and affordable.Oil and gas companies pledge to lower methane emissions: In a first at any COP summit, at least 50 oil and natural gas producers, including Saudi Aramco and 29 other national oil companies, signed an agreement to reduce their carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and curb methane emissions to near-zero by 2030. According to a COP28 spokesperson, this agreement is significant because these 50 oil and gas companies account for 40 percent of the global oil production. They committed to setting interim targets that would reduce methane emissions to 0.2 percent of oil and natural gas production by 2030, and to end routine flaring.Food and agriculture declaration: Another first at COP28 was that countries agreed upon the role of food systems and agriculture in carbon emissions. More than 130 countries signed this declaration on the premise that food contributes a third of the warming gases increasing global temperatures.Declaration of climate and health: The health impacts of climate change took centre stage for the first time in 28 years of UN climate talks. The declaration calls for climate action to achieve “benefits for health from deep, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, including from just transitions, lower air pollution, active mobility, and shifts to sustainable healthy diets.”Global Cooling Pledge: Over 60 countries signed the Global Cooling Pledge, a new initiative launched at COP28 to reduce cooling-related emissions across all sectors by at least 68 percent globally by 2050 compared to 2022 levels. It aims to do this by promoting the adoption of energy-efficient cooling technologies, reducing refrigerant leakage, and phasing out harmful refrigerants. Additionally, the pledge will provide financial and technical assistance to developing countries to help them transition to sustainable cooling technologies."

We have filed the writ petition on the RBI's action of superseding the board of the bank. We requested the court to hear us on an urgent basis,"" Ghandat said.The RBI superseded the Mumbai-based Abhyudaya Cooperative Bank's board on November 24, citing material concerns related to poor corporate governance standards. Ghandat said in his writ petition that allegations against the ousted board are very old.“We told the court that we were improving, but the RBI expelled us from the board,"" he said.Ghandat also claimed that after the supersession, the expelled board members sought a meeting with RBI officials to ask them to reconsider the decision, but did not get any further response.An email sent to the RBI seeking comment on the matter remained unanswered at the time of filing this story.No interferenceLegal experts suggested that the courts are unlikely to provide relief to Ghandat.""Usually, the high court would refuse to interfere in such matters since the RBI’s authority as regulator and its power to supersede are incontrovertible,"" said Achyuth Ajithkumar, a partner at Traya Law and advocate-on-record, Supreme Court of India.Ajithkumar said the SREI Group had challenged the RBI’s decision in 2021 to supersede its board in the Bombay High Court, claiming the regulator had acted in ""complete haste, entirely arbitrarily and without application of mind.""""The high court refused to interfere and dismissed the petition,” he said. “A possible ground of challenge might be the vague nature of the recorded reasons.""Under administratorThe RBI action is valid for 12 months, the central bank said. It appointed Satya Prakash Pathak, a former chief general manager of State Bank of India, as administrator to manage the bank’s affairs during this period. The RBI clarified that no business restrictions have been placed on the bank and it can continue normal activities under the guidance of the administrator.Abhyudaya Cooperative Bank had more than 1.73 million depositors, deposits of Rs 10,838 crore, and advances of Rs 6,654 crore as of March 31, 2020, according to its website. The bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 12.6 percent as of that date. Data after 2020 are not available in the public domain.Ghandat earlier alleged that the RBI could be working to merge Abhyudaya Cooperative Bank with another lender.""Our bank's due diligence has been running for the last two months and they (the RBI) are working to give this bank to some big people,” Ghandat told Moneycontrol on November 27. “Generally, such kind of due diligence occurs when someone is in the mood to take over the bank. But I realise that if they want to give this bank to someone or to (get) small finance banks or to merge into some bank, then I would say the bank asset is in a good position.""The RBI has been cracking down on erring cooperative banks in recent times. In September 2019, the RBI superseded the board of PMC Bank and placed it under various restrictions after detecting financial irregularities, hiding and misreporting of loans given to real estate developer HDIL.Later, PMC Bank was amalgamated into Unity Small Finance Bank, which came into effect in January 2022."

BJD’s claims of innocence are finding no takers given the party’s long stewardship of the state during which the raided firm, Baldev Sahu & Sons, had a virtual monopoly","The massive cash haul from country liquor vends in Odisha could not have come at a worse time for the Naveen Patnaik government. Amounting to an eyebrow-raising Rs 333.5 crore at last count, the seizures are said to be among the biggest in the history of the Income Tax department, if not the biggest.As Naveen and his Biju Janata Dal (BJD) prepare for a record sixth consecutive term in office, the cash seizures at three locations in western Odisha over the past week have caused a serious dent in the government’s clean image. Coming as it does in the immediate aftermath of big wins in the three heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the IT raids have come as a much-needed shot in the arm for the BJP.Cash Stashing Under BJD’s Nose The party has predictably left no stone unturned to pin the BJD government down on the issue. It has already organised a statewide protest on Monday, accusing the government of being in cahoots with a liquor trader with roots in neighbouring Jharkhand and insinuating that the money was kept for its use in the coming elections.On its part, BJD has sought to wriggle out of the sticky wicket by pointing to the discrepancy in the statements by BJP’s central leaders and those issued by the party’s state leaders. “While BJP’s central leaders have been training their guns on Congress over the issue, the party’s state leaders are targeting the BJD in a bid to save the Congress here,” BJD spokesperson Lenin Mohanty said on Monday.But unfortunately for the ruling party, there are few takers in the state for this convoluted logic. What BJD is finding hard to explain away is this. What were the officials of the Excise department and the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the state police doing while the cash was being stashed in liquor vends?Stink In The Liquor TradeThere are two things that make BJD’s claim of innocence suspect and lend credence to the charge of the government being in league with Baldev Sahu & Sons and its subsidiaries.First, its massive push to open more and more liquor shops, even in the face of protests across the state, is now being seen, in retrospect, as a quid pro quo to facilitate huge profits for the liquor traders. Not satisfied with a 368 percent jump in liquor revenue from Rs 1,279 crore to Rs 6,445 crore between 2012 and 2022, the state Excise department has set a target of Rs 7,800 crore for the 2023-24 fiscal.Second, liquor vends in the state have not been auctioned since 1995, ensuring that the same set of traders keep running their business unhindered by paying an annual renewal fee. In another move seen as a sop to liquor traders, the state government had empowered district collectors as the sole decision maker in granting licenses, both for foreign and country liquor, in August this year.Read : Odisha cash haul set to be 'highest-ever'Baldev Sahu & Sons, which has a virtual monopoly of the country liquor trade in large parts of the state, has enjoyed leverage with the government and flourished in the state for decades even when the BJD was not in power. But the party helmed by Naveen Patnaik is in no position to blame the previous Congress government for its rise since it has enjoyed untrammeled power for close to 24 years now.BJP Goes On The OffensivePolitically, the massive mandate for BJP in MP, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh appears to have raised the sagging morale of the BJP in the state and led to a reconfiguration of its equation with Naveen Patnaik. With the three states under its belt, the party reckons it will not be as dependent on the support of the BJD in Parliament in the next term (if it wins) as it is in the current term because the composition of the Rajya Sabha, where it is currently short of numbers to get various Bills passed and thus dependent on parties like BJD and YSRCP, is bound the change in the next two years.Signs of the revised strategy are already visible with the party lining up multiple visits by its top honchos, including the Big Two of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home minister Amit Shah, over the next two to three months. The buzz in the saffron party suggests the party’s top leadership is all set to shed its diffidence in taking on the BJD.Allegations of a ‘deal’ with Naveen Patnaik has dogged the party ever since 2019 and there are clear indications that the BJP may be bracing for a change of its stance vis-à-vis the BJD and overcome the crisis of credibility that has been a bane for it over the last four years and more.Modi’s upcoming visit to the state later this month could provide a clearer picture of whether this change of tack is for real.Sandeep Sahu is a senior Bhubaneswar-based journalist and columnist, who has authored a biography of President Droupadi Murmu published by Penguin India.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Production cuts by OPEC+ are clearly not working. Despite the announcement of further cuts by the cartel, oil prices continue to slide and have touched a six-month low. Crude oil is down for seven straight weeks, the longest weekly losing streak since 2018.The oil market is flooded with supplies even as demand refuses to pick up. API data shows a net build in crude oil inventories in the United States of just over 18 million barrels this year.The US is not adding to its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) despite an announcement by the Biden Administration to do so. The Department of Energy (DoE) reported that crude oil inventories in the SPR stayed at 351.9 million barrels, with total purchases for the SPR coming in just over 5 million barrels (as compared to 180 million barrels sold in the last year) since the buyback program was announced in the second half of this year. The market is worried about global oil demand and rising inflation.The worrying sign is that even though we are in the middle of the winter season, gasoline and other distillates inventories are rising. This week, it rose by 5.8 million barrels, on top of the 2.83-million-barrel in the week prior. Gasoline inventories are over one percent below the five-year average for this time of year, while distillates are 13 percent below the five-year average.The weekly average of Russia's seaborne crude exports on the supply side jumped to the highest level since early July. Spreads between monthly contracts are the lowest since June 2023, indicating oversupply. The contango in the oil market indicates oversupply.The US is also pumping more oil into the world market, replacing the lower output from OPEC+. The country is exporting close to a record 6 million barrels of crude oil per day.Further, the lifting of sanctions on Venezuela, currently the lowest-price supplier in the market, has also added to the market pressure.A Washington-based consultant's report on the long-term direction of the oil market has helped spread the bearish story in the oil market. Rapidan Energy Group says that OPEC+ must carefully control oil supplies for another five years to avoid a ""meltdown"" in crude prices. Global oil demand is not expected to peak for at least another decade, but supplies from outside OPEC — particularly the US — are growing faster than previously estimated.Non-OPEC supplies will increase by 700,000 barrels annually by 2030, mainly from the US, Guyana and Brazil. Further, OPEC+ collectively has nearly 5 million barrels of spare production capacity daily.Given the bearish outlook, traders have built up their position on the short side. Sell positions by Hedge Funds and traders equals roughly 58 million barrels in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts over the seven days ending December 5. Fund managers have sold oil in nine of the 11 recent weeks, reducing their position by 385 million barrels since Sept. 19.Oil market traders seem to be of the view that the OPEC+ cartel may resist any further cuts. Given this scenario, we may have more oil arriving in the market from non-OPEC players, which will help keep prices lower.Though there may be some volatility in the market as the IEA, OPEC and the US Energy Department publish their latest monthly assessments of market fundamentals, oil's medium to long-term story is bearish.Investing insights from our research teamDOMS Industries IPO: Will this stationery player make a mark at the bourses?Is the time ripe to add position in this chemical stock?India Shelter Finance: Should investors consider this housing finance IPO?What else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: I-bankers play on fund managers' FOMO , HNI’s sweet tooth, IREDA soarsCore retail inflation continues to fall in November.

The index of industrial production (IIP) grew 11.7 percent in October. In other words, this implies that the millions of factories, from the large corporations that are flag bears of India’s emerging global manufacturing might, to the micro enterprises peppered across the country’s landscape, produced 11.7 per cent more output in October this year compared to a contraction of 4.1 per cent during the the same month last year.Capital goods output, a popular proxy to measure levels of investment activity, grew by 22.6 per cent, a sharp swing from the previous year’s contraction of 2.9 per cent in October. Prima facie this should be a sign of good augury. If more machinery and equipment are being rolled out, it would, other things remaining the same, mean that factories are looking to add new capacity lines to meet growing demand for their goods.It may, therefore, be tantalising to consider that goods are flying off faster from shop shelves than before. Household consumption and buying patterns are driven as much by their current income levels as also by what they believe their future income growth is likely to be.Read: India's most optimistic economist just got even more bullishConfidence in future income growth is a key determinant in buying decisions of many products, particularly cars and consumer durables, as most of these are bought on loans. A household should feel confident enough about their ability to finance a loan over a five to seven year period for a product (such as a car or a refrigerator) that they would buy now.The industrial output has some key data points. The headline growth in the consumer durables output has been recorded at 15.9 per cent in October 2023, from an 18.1 percent contraction the same month of 2022. The favourable base effect—a statistical phenomenon—may have partly magnified the growth numbers.A few caveats, therefore, may be in order: The growth in the index of industrial production—the closest approximation for measuring economic activity in the country’s business landscape—needs to be seen over a period of time, rather than a single month’s data.November will be the crucial month to fit a more discerning trend. Diwali was in November this year, which is when household buying activity and consumer goods’ demand would have peaked. If the trend of IIP growth holds robustly through November-December, then it would be reasonable to assume that the broader economy, powered by consumer demand, is accelerating onto a faster track.Gaurav Choudhury is consulting editor, Network 18.

Consequently, ""caution should be employed while interpreting the higher-than-expected IIP expansion,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA.Festival season mismatchWhen it comes to the IIP data, the impact of the base effect – wherein the year-ago period, based on which the year-on-year change in production is calculated, helped in pushing up the latest month's growth figure – was rather pronounced thanks to the differences in the festival calendars of 2022 and 2023.Also Read: Optimism among businesses, but India's consumption story has cracksTake, for instance, the growth in capital, consumer durable, and consumer non-durable goods. In November, the output in these three segments jumped by 22.6 percent, 15.9 percent, and 8.6 percent, respectively.In October 2022, their output contracted by 2.9 percent, 18.1 percent, and 13 percent, respectively, making it instructive to compare last month's output with that of October 2021.In 2021, Diwali was on November 4, around the same time as this year.The festival season is the time when households shop a lot more than they do at other times of the year and make big-ticket purchases.When compared to October 2021, production of consumer durables and non-durables in October 2023 was 5 percent lower. As such, the strong base effect has ""masked the weakness in the consumer goods segment"", Rajani Sinha, chief economist at CareEdge, said.This is not to say it’s all bad news. Production of capital goods, for example, is up 19 percent compared to October 2021, reflecting the government's focus on capital expenditure. But the future is not going to be as rosy. Economists see industrial growth dropping off sharply in November to low single digits – again, due to a base effect – as the fewer working days on account of festivals also took a toll on production efforts.Inflation roller-coasterIf the low base was good for IIP, it was the opposite for inflation but not as bad as was thought, as the headline number came a quarter percentage point lower than expected. And it has to rise even further to 6.4 percent in December to meet the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) forecast of 5.6 percent for the October-December period.The problem, though, is that December's reading – to be released on January 12, weeks before Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents the interim budget for 2024-25 and the RBI's next interest rate decision on February 8 – is tracking along those lines.""The December CPI inflation estimate is tracking at 6.2-6.4 percent as base effect turns adverse,"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at IDFC First Bank.""High-frequency food prices in the first two weeks of December show that vegetable prices have moderated, reflecting improved supply dynamics. However, the moderation is much lesser than the usual winter season decline.""Just how adverse will the base effect be in December?If one assumes the overall price momentum – month-on-month change in prices – is the same as it was in November and the general index of the CPI rises 0.5 percent sequentially, inflation could rise to 6.6 percent! Source: QuantEco ResearchHowever, this will hide what is happening below the covers.According to QuantEco Research's economists, the median inflation rate for the 299 items in the CPI basket was at a 32-month low of 4 percent in November. Further, 50.5 percent of these items had an inflation rate that stood within the RBI's 2-6 percent tolerance range – the highest such proportion in more than five years. Clearly, one must wait for the base-effect dirt to settle before drawing any conclusions."

The government has restricted exports of a wide range of food staples, including onions, wheat and rice, as it tries to curb costs for consumers.Economists pointed to an easing in core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, as a sign that the RBI may keep rates on hold for longer, and likely cut rates next year. Core prices rose 4.12% in November from a year earlier, down from 4.25% in October, according to estimates from Bloomberg Economics.“High food inflation has disrupted CPI inflation’s moderating trajectory, but inflation expectations appear anchored, despite rising food prices, and there is no evidence of any material second order effects,” Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Barclays Plc, wrote in a note.The RBI kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a fifth straight policy meeting last week, with Governor Shaktikanta Das warning about the risks from food prices. Economists predict the RBI will likely keep rates on hold well into next year, and possibly only ease after the US Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates.What Bloomberg Economics SaysA drop in core inflation to 4.1% from 4.3% in October countered a bigger rise in the headline reading. A sustained decline in core inflation suggests the central bank’s tight monetary stance is helping contain demand-led pressures.— Abhishek Gupta, India economistFor full report, click hereSeparately, the government also released figures showing growth in factory output accelerated to a 16-month high of 11.7% in October, adding to the economy’s strong outlook. The central bank last week kept its inflation forecast unchanged at 5.4% for the current fiscal year, but raised its growth projection to 7% from 6.5%.Axis Bank Ltd. estimates India’s potential growth has increased to 7%, which implies the economy can expand at that pace without triggering an inflation spiral.Food inflation, which makes up about half of the consumer price basket, accelerated to 8.7% in November from 6.61% in the previous month, Tuesday’s data showed. Prices of pulses and vegetables jumped 20.23% and 17.7%, respectively, from a year ago. The cost of vegetables such as onions and tomatoes have surged after erratic rains during the monsoon period led to shortages.Clothing and footwear costs rose 3.9% in November from a year earlier, while housing prices jumped 3.55%. Fuel and electricity costs fell 0.77%.“The surge in November CPI inflation has solely been led by food inflation,” said Upasna Bhardwaj, economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. “We continue to monitor the key food items as production remains a worry amidst weak sowing, lower reservoir levels and continued erratic weather conditions.”"

The nation needs to create jobs at every level going along the path of development, said Rajan, presently Katherine Dusak Miller Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at Chicago Booth, USA.""Jobs is the single most important pressure point... If we had many more private sector jobs showing up, would there be so much pressure on reservations? Perhaps there'll be less so to some extent,"" he said, regretting that states are trying to reserve jobs for their residents, which is a worrisome trend.""...that's a reflection of the fact that we're not providing jobs. And I would say that it is the primary concern. We are a united country. You can't reserve jobs in your state for people from the state. It has to be available for everybody. We've benefited so much from each other's migration,"" Rajan said in an interview to PTI.Making a case for improvement of human capital, he said, ""if we create well educated high school graduates, if we move some of them to vocational training"", lots of jobs can be created in the next six months to a year and the nation will not have to wait for 10 years to generate employment.Citing an example, he said, ""one place where we are severely understaffed is local government, partly because they don't do very much. You need to improve the functions that they have to do."" Rajan further said, ""If we improve the human capital, the biggest problem of today, the jobs that we need, will come automatically...if you also improve the quality of the workforce, companies will come to India. We constantly hear from entrepreneurs (that they) can't find good workers."" He said that by skilling the average level of jobs can be transformed into good jobs. ""So it's really about how we do this by taking the long view. The longer view doesn't mean results only in the long term. It means results all along the way. It means that when we end there, we will come to 2047 with a population that can be upper middle income,"" he added.Rajan also underlined the need for governance reforms with focus on decentralisation and improving democratic institutions.""We need to have governance reform which means building on our democracy and focusing on decentralization...One example of good decentralization is the daily administration which has to focus on providing social services to the poor and the middle class, such as education, mobile app clinics etc,"" he said.India, he added, ""needs stronger democracy, not a weaker democracy besides strengthening distribution and becoming more inclusive, taking all our people with us...We need to create the opportunities for people, entrepreneurs"".According to the book, ""our current growth is largely jobless, which means we need more growth to create necessary employment or else the demographic dividend will evaporate in front of our eyes... Another possibility is that our growth and GDP have been overestimated since 2013, when we changed the method of estimating the GDP.""India, the book concludes, ""is at a cross road. We must embark on the Indian way, which builds on our strengths rather than our weaknesses. Our strengths include our spirit of inquiry and debate... Those not only make life in India more empowering and fulfilling for every citizen, they will also help us build the economy of the future.""Besides other things, the authors pointed out issues concerning data collection. For instance, they said India has not collected consumption data in the last six years, since the last report from 2017 was suppressed, perhaps because leaked versions suggested an increase in poverty and the latest census data is from 2011. The new decadal round has simply been shelved.""The infrequently collected data on employment is noisy, often not square with the lived reality of the citizenry,"" they said.The authors argued that they are not against manufacturing, they are against pouring enormous subsidies into attracting the lowest end of the manufacturing supply chain, assuming that will attract the rest.They observed that India, for a variety of reasons, missed the manufacturing bus when China took it. ""The China path of starting with low skilled assembly and moving up there will not work well for us because China and others are already there and have competed down the profits,"" they opined."

Prices have been falling for months, suggesting weak overall demand both inside China and in global markets. Youth unemployment is precariously high and local government debts are adding to pressures on the financial system.The Xinhua report said China was contending with slack demand, excess industrial capacity, weak consumer confidence and ""certain risks and hidden problems"" and a world that has grown increasingly ""complex, severe and uncertain.""""China still has to overcome some difficulties and challenges to further revive the economy,"" it said. ""It is important to be more mindful of potential dangers and to effectively respond to and solve these problems, but it also called for greater confidence, saying that ""favorable conditions outweigh unfavorable factors.""The annual economic work conference is usually held in mid-December. It followed a meeting of top party leaders last week where Xinhua reported that Xi had described 2024 as a ""crucial year' for attaining goals laid out in the party's five-year plan through 2025.Reports on both meetings suggest officials are seeking greater consistency in carrying out policies. That hints at concerns over moves in recent years that have at times caused major disruptions, such as strict and disruptive anti-COVID 19 policies that Beijing abruptly abandoned late last year.Tuesday’s report said the meeting had called for maintaining stability and for establishing ""the new before abolishing the old,"" a phrase analysts said suggested greater caution and a more gradual approach.Policy swings such as the decision late last year to abruptly drop the anti-virus controls, and uncertainty over regulatory changes have also unnerved foreign companies operating in China and appear to be deterring foreign investment, which has fallen sharply in recent months.The economy has been slowing from its past double-digit growth for years and is forecast to have expanded at about a 5% annual pace this year, in line with the government’s target. Most estimates suggest it will slow further next year.Last week, Moody's Investor Service downgraded China's sovereign debt rating as the country's real estate crisis seeps into local governments and private financing. It also downgraded ratings for some major Chinese banks and insurance companies.China has tipped into deflation in recent months, another sign of weakness.Wholesale, or producer prices, have fallen year-on-year for all of 2023, dipping to a low of minus 5.4% in June. Consumer price inflation has hovered near 0% or below in annual terms since April.The property sector, a major source of demand for any major economy, has stalled with dozens of developers defaulting on their debts and struggling to finish apartments they promised to deliver.In response, the government has eased borrowing rules and cut mortgage rates for first-time home buyers while providing some tax relief measures for small businesses. Late last month, it announced plans to issue 1 trillion yuan ($330 billion) in bonds for infrastructure projects and disaster prevention, dipping deeper into deficit to try to nudge the economy into higher gear.The weak housing market is among trends that have sapped enthusiasm for spending, hindering progress toward increasing domestic demand to help drive growth. Another is the high rate of unemployment among young Chinese, which was at about 20% as of June. That is the latest figure available after the government suspended its monthly reporting on that measure.The Xinhua report said leaders had resolved to do everything possible to ""secure people's livelihoods and improve their well-being"" and to emphasize stable employment."

Typically, banks need to set aside 100 percent of the written-off loan amount as provisions, which impacts their profitability.In India, banks follow several methods to recover loans. They can use their internal mechanism and techniques to recover loans or they can use the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for the same. IBC was aimed at expediting and simplifying bankruptcy proceedings and to facilitate fairness.However, even after seven years of its launch, the recovery of loans through insolvency courts remains low even as the number of cases being admitted is on the rise. A September 2023 report by rating agency CareEdge showed that the number of cases in April-June FY24 jumped to 6,815, compared to 5,250 in the corresponding quarter last year. In the same period, data from some of the top lenders showed that recovery has been following a downtrend on a year-on-year basis.The central bank had earlier asked banks to work aggressively to recover bad loans.RBI Deputy Governor Swaminathan J had, in the August 2023 monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting, stressed the need for banks to redouble their efforts to recover written-off loans. “We would like banks to redouble their efforts and see more recoveries,” Swaminathan said in a post-MPC meeting conference."

It also paves the way for Vasundhara Raje’s eclipse.

The BJP's two deputy chief ministerial choices – Diya Kumari and Prem Chand Bairwa – complete the party's careful focus on caste equation to get the poll ready for the Lok Sabha elections.With the Rajasthan appointment, the BJP has fashioned a comprehensive response to the caste census chorus of the Opposition. It has picked up tribal, an OBC, and upper caste faces as chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan respectively.Why Sharma, Diya Kumari & BairwaHaving won the Sanganer Assembly seat for the first time, CM-elect Sharma gained the endorsement of the party brass for his organisational skills. Sharma, 56, joins the club of 50s – which also includes Chhattisgarh (Vishnu Deo Sai, 59) and Madhya Pradesh (Mohan Yadav, 58).With this, the BJP has made its intent clear that the party is expediting a leadership transition to give the new faces at least 10 years to helm the states. This writer had earlier written about BJP’s intent to give the chosen CM faces ample time to lead their respective states.The BJP has also made it clear that the party is scripting social engineering by accommodating aspirations of caste groups. Sharma is a Brahmin, and the caste leaders had been lamenting in hushed voices of not being picked up for top jobs in states.Diya Kumari, 52, hails from an erstwhile royal family, and her choice is a clear attempt of the BJP to groom young leaders from princely lineages as per the political tradition of Rajasthan. In that regard, she will inherit the political legacy of former state chief minister Vasundhara Raje in the state.Read : BJP's CM-designate Bhajan Lal Sharma meets Guv, stakes claim to form govtPrem Chandra Bairwa, 54, belongs to the scheduled caste community, which has influence in almost 60 of the Assembly seats in Rajasthan.

The party would like her to take up the role of a mentor. The BJP had conveyed to her the message that the party is now working on a leadership transition as a roadmap for the 2029 Lok Sabha elections.With the BJP firing up the ambitions of the party workers by picking up younger leaders for the CMs in states, Raje possibly sensed the direction in which the political winds were blowing and that she may not retain the loyalties of MLAs belonging to her faction if she created roadblocks.CM-elect Sharma has served as the party's general secretary in the Rajasthan unit and gained attention of the senior party leaders for his street power and forceful articulation of the Hindutva cause, as well as leading protests in the state against the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government. Interestingly, the Chhattisgarh and MP CM-designates Vishnu Deo Sai and Mohan Yadav are also in the same mould as Sharma, and known as combative leaders.Over to the 2024 Lok Sabha election campaign now. Meanwhile, the voters of Rajasthan will hold Sharma to the party's promises of addressing the state's law and order challenges.Manish Anand is a senior Delhi-based journalist.

While mining output was up 13.1 percent as against 11.5 percent in September, electricity production jumped by 20.4 percent, sharply higher than the 9.9 percent growth it had posted the previous month.In terms of the use-based classification of goods, production growth in October was higher for all six categories compared to September:>> Primary goods: 11.4 percent versus 8.0 percent in September>> Capital goods: 22.6 percent versus 8.4 percent in September>> Intermediate goods: 9.7 percent versus 6.1 percent in September>> Infrastructure goods: 11.3 percent versus 8.9 percent in September>> Consumer durable goods: 15.9 percent versus 1.1 percent in September>> Consumer non-durable goods: 8.6 percent versus 3.0 percent in SeptemberWith a favourable base effect - thanks to Diwali taking place in October in 2022 but in November in 2023 - resulting in a big IIP growth number for last month, economists warned the picture was not all that rosy.""While the prospects of infrastructure and construction goods segment remain encouraging, the strong base effect has masked the weakness in the consumer goods segment,"" said Rajani Sinha, chief economist at ratings agency CareEdge.While production of consumer durables and non-durables was up 15.9 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, in October compared to the same month last year, both their indices - which correspond to actual production figures - were 5 percent lower than what they were in the same month of 2021.In 2021, Diwali had occurred on November 4.This, according to Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, suggests that ""caution should be employed while interpreting the higher-than-expected IIP expansion"" last month.""Moreover, electricity demand growth had slid from 21 percent in October 2023 to 6 percent in November 2023, before a contraction emerged in early December 2023,"" Nayar further said, adding that she expects IIP growth to slow down sharply to 2-4 percent in November due to fewer number of working days (on account of the festival season) and an unfavourable base effect.""Given the shift in the festive calendar, we believe it would be more meaningful to compare the average year-on-year growth performance in October-November 2023 vis-à-vis October-November 2022,"" Nayar added.IIP growth has averaged 9.0 percent in October-November 2023 as against 1.8 percent in the same two months last year.""All said and done, we expect moderation in October-December 2023 real GDP growth,"" said Nikhil Gupta, chief economist at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.The IIP is a key input in the computation of quarterly GDP data. In July-September, India's growth rate came in at a far higher-than-expected 7.6 percent, leading to economists - as well as the Reserve Bank of India - raising their forecasts for 2023-24. The government is expected to follow suit and make a similar upward revision to its forecast of 6.5 percent sometime later this month."

On the other hand, the price index for potato declined 1 percent MoM, data from the statistics ministry showed.Other food items to show strong price momentum included egg (2.8 percent rise MoM), pulses (1.6 percent), sugar (1.2 percent), and cereals (0.9 percent). Meanwhile, fruits and edible oils declined by 0.4 percent and 0.2 percent, sequentially.On the whole, food inflation as per the CPI rose to 8.70 percent in November from 6.61 percent in October.Food apart, the price momentum was largely subdued, with the price indices for housing, clothing and footwear, fuel and light, and miscellaneous categories only rising by 0.1-0.3 percent each compared to their October levels. This helped bring down core inflation - or inflation excluding food and fuel - further to 4.1 percent in November from 4.3 percent the previous month.""Core inflation is currently reaching the RBI's target rate,"" Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers, noted.Policy impactWhile headline retail inflation has come in lower than expected in November, it will do little to change the course of India's monetary policy.""We believe that the policy rates are appropriate at the current juncture and no further tightening is warranted in the near term, unless there is a durable shock to the CPI inflation trajectory,"" Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ICRA, said.""Consequently, we expect the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to maintain status quo for the next couple of policy meetings, and foresee a shallow rate cut cycle of around 50-75 basis points, commencing in the August 2024 meeting,"" Nayar added.Also Read: No forward guidance again from RBI Governor Das, but clues remainLast week, the MPC had retained the policy repo rate at 6.5 percent for the fifth meeting in a row, with the rate-setting panel noting that ""recurring food price shocks are impeding the ongoing disinflation process"".""The path of disinflation needs to be sustained. The MPC will carefully monitor any signs of generalisation of food price pressures which can fritter away the gains in easing of core inflation,"" it had added.As per the RBI's latest forecast, CPI inflation is seen averaging 5.6 percent in October-December. With data for the first two months of the current quarter available, retail inflation must rise even further to 6.4 percent in December to meet the Indian central bank's projection.""The December CPI inflation estimate is tracking at 6.2-6.4 percent, as base-effect turns adverse,"" said Gaura Sen Gupta, India economist at IDFC First Bank.""High-frequency food prices in the first two weeks of December show that vegetable prices have moderated, reflecting improved supply dynamics. That said, the moderation is much lesser than the usual winter season decline,"" Sen Gupta added.Inflation data for December will be released on January 12. It will be the last set of inflation numbers before the central government presents the Interim Budget for 2024-25 on February 1 and the MPC meets on February 6-8 for its next sit-down."

Kharge’s criticism of DK Shivakumar mirrors this divide in the party and society","Congress President Mallikarjun M Kharge’s public outburst against Karnataka Deputy Chief DK Shivakumar exposes the chinks within the party on the contentious issue of caste census. While the Congress as a party has taken a stand in favour of caste census both at the national level and in Karnataka, Shivakumar who is also the state Congress president has signed a petition opposing the same.When Kharge was prodded in the Rajya Sabha by BJP member Sushil Kumar Modi over the internal dispute within the Congress, he responded, “All upper caste people are united on this. Shivakumar is also opposing it, BJP is also opposing it. Both are one on this issue. Upper caste people will be united internally.”Karnataka’s Caste Census ReportThough Karnataka was the first  state to hold a caste census in the country during Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s earlier term between 2013 and 2018, Bihar was the first to release the report of the survey it had conducted. Bihar’s census data showed that while upper castes comprised only 15 percent, the “marginalised” classes  made up 85 percent of the population.While the Karnataka report was never made public, the data which was leaked in 2018 indicated that Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes constituted a majority of the population. Ever since the formation of the state in 1956, Vokkaligas and Lingayats had assumed political superiority by the virtue of their assumed numerical dominance which was not based on any empirical data.If the report is accepted and implemented, it could significantly loosen the stronghold that these two communities have had over the state’s political affairs for decades. It could also  have a cascading effect on various other sectors.Challenge To Lingayat-Vokkaliga DominanceA majority of the Chief Ministers of the state have been Lingayats and Vokkaligas, while no Dalit has held the post so far. A demographic change would also involve reworking the reservation matrix which would ensure greater representation for the marginalised sections in various areas like jobs, educational institutions and even legislative bodies.The opposition to the caste census comes not only from Shivakumar but from upper caste leaders cutting across parties who appear to be more worried about their own political future rather than the progress of the disadvantaged.Deprived sections have a right to political representation and the state’s resources in proportion to their population. To deny them this, amounts to perpetuating the discrimination and ostracisation that they have faced for centuries.Gautham Machaiah is a senior journalist and political commentator based in Bengaluru.

However, employee churn at senior levels remains elevated at large companies. The latest executive to send the resignation letter is Nilanjan Roy, chief financial officer of Infosys. A couple of days ago, Wipro announced the departure of its chief growth officer Stephanie Trautman.The exits mark a series of departures at these companies. Notable among these are Mohit Joshi and Ravi Kumar at Infosys who went on to become CEOs of Tech Mahindra and Cognizant, respectively. Jatin Dalal from Wipro took up the chief financial officer role at Cognizant. Executives from Wipro went on to take up leadership roles at firms such as CitiusTech and Arthur D. Little. Top management changes and exits are also seen at TCS and Tech Mahindra. But the level of senior exits at TCS are much lower compared to other companies.Given the size of these organisations, the companies can easily reallocate the roles of the departing executives. Even so, senior exits have been too frequent for investors' comfort. Infosys and Wipro lost two executives per quarter in the current calendar year on an average.Loss of senior talent in quick succession can weigh on business momentum, especially in the current growth moderation phase. As analysts explain, the new leaders take time to get a good grip over their roles. Also, departing leaders can tap talent and business relationships of their previous organisations, intensifying competition. Cognizant’s increased focus on large projects under Ravi Kumar is a case in point.Both Nilanjan Roy and Stephanie Trautman were hired by the current leaders at Infosys and Wipro during organisation revival efforts. While Infosys achieved the desired progress, Wipro seems to be sputtering on the turnaround.Nilanjan Roy has served Infosys close to five years till now. Stephanie Trautman has spent around three years at Wipro. Three to five years may seem a reasonable time in the current fast-changing world. But senior leaders used to stick around for a longer time in the past. Note that companies thrive under a stable leadership team who serve long tenures.To instil organisation culture and improve loyalty, companies are mandating work from office for regular employees. Perhaps organisations should devise innovative programmes to improve employee loyalty at senior levels, too.As it turns out, small and tier-II companies are doing good work in tapping talent from the frontline peers.Several companies have successfully tapped talent at tier-I companies, improving their performances. “Over the last ten years, we have seen multiple cases of segmental heads of tier-1 IT Services companies joining as the CEO of a tier-2 company. In most cases, such transitions have worked well for tier-2 companies, characterised by a reset of their growth trajectory or operations, or both,” analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities said in a note.

Such a warning might not seem pertinent for much of the world where central banks are arguably still fighting the battle against inflation. But in China, it seems highly relevant.

What you need to know“The first meeting of the GoM has the agenda of prevention of money laundering through domestic online gaming apps and offshore illegal betting operators. Many offshore operators masquerade as legal entities offer games and indulge in money laundering. The GoM will discuss how to tackle it holistically with more checks and balances on their transactions,” one person aware of the development told Moneycontrol.Mahadev appThe Indian online gaming market size is estimated at $2.5 billion while globally, it is worth $159 billion, he said.The agenda of the first meeting of the GoM has been set given the Mahadev online gaming app, which is embroiled in a money laundering controversy. Ahead of the November state assembly elections, the Directorate of Enforcement investigated allegations that the illegal gaming app was involved in laundering money that led to political parties in Chhattisgarh receiving Rs 508 crore.Gaming companies told Moneycontrol that to allay the concerns of the government on money laundering, they welcome standardised regulations on KYC and matching deposit and withdrawal payment instruments.According to Games 24x7 co-founder Trivikraman Thampy, full Know Your Customer (KYC) of users should be done and gaming platforms must accept money only from legitimate banking channels. Most deposits currently come through UPI (Unified Payments Interface), which is from banks. Platforms can also ensure that when users withdraw money, it goes back to the same channel so that no laundering takes place.“If the government can standardise this for KYC, deposit instruments, matching deposit and withdrawal instruments – it will tie up the whole chain. It will address most concerns that the government has around money laundering once the right regulations are in place,” Thampy told Moneycontrol.The GoM is likely to discuss a policy strategy for anti-money laundering practices to be complied with by all online gaming operators, which may include not allowing cash for deposits or withdrawals.“Once the regulations are in place to prevent illegal gaming apps, the government may lay down permissible games to ensure the entire ecosystem of advertising, publishing, distributors, payment service providers, and crowd computing providers do not onboard a game that does not have a registration mark from the government. Lack of regulation makes it hard for law enforcement officers,” Thampy said.Earlier, the government approved the formation of self-regulatory bodies for the primary purpose of verifying online real money games as permissible. These bodies were to be formed as part of an independent process, with the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology as the nodal ministry. These were put on hold as the GoM was put in place.Blacklist and whitelist""As per media reports, the government has concerns about accountability and transparency on self-regulatory bodies as they are created by the industry. A government oversight committee can be there on top of SRBs. Even a government regulator is welcome,” Thampy said.The E-Gaming Federation (EGF) said that to prevent money laundering in the sector, the government should clarify rules for operators and payment gateways and may follow a mix of blacklist and whitelist approaches to facilitate domestic industry achieve global standards.“The industry wants clarity on norms, protocols to be adopted, where we can operate,” EGF CEO Anurag Saxena told Moneycontrol. “Hope GoM focuses on encouraging the domestic market so that Indians play in a safe environment and weeding out predatory companies through enforcement… Blacklisting has limitations. Whitelisting can happen via SRB norms under which Indian gaming companies can operate. SRBs can help ensure that money laundering, predatory recovery practices and financial frauds are prevented.”Once the rules are clarified for operators, payment gateways and banks, there will be a framework within which gaming companies can operate. It will ensure stronger operating norms for domestic players and best practices. Facilitative regulation will help the industry achieve global standards, he said."

Key imports are petroleum products (USD 4.6 billion) and urea (USD 1.2 billion). These account for 73 per cent of imports.Other key products are propylene and ethylene polymers (USD 383 million), pet coke (USD $265 million), gypsum (USD 115 million), chemicals (USD 417 million), iron and steel (USD 62 million), and unwrought aluminium (USD 95 million).""These products will gain from FTA-led tariff elimination by India. Most are raw materials and input to industries and India has opened most such imports from other FTA partner countries,"" the report said.On the services side, it said, in 2022, India's service exports to Oman were worth about USD 2.8 billion, while its imports were USD 0.2 billion.""India could seek increased access to the Omani market for business services and computer and information services, which Oman regularly imports. India might also negotiate for priority visas for its professionals on short-term assignments in Oman. Oman has a weak services sector and may not press for much opening of Indian markets,"" Srivastava said.To provide greater market access for its pharma products, India may request Oman for track approval for Indian pharma products that are already registered with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), UK drug regulator MHRA and European Medicines Agency, it said.India's free trade agreement with the UAE has a similar proposal. India has implemented a trade agreement with the UAE in May. Both Oman and UAE are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).India's GDP of about USD 3.5 trillion is significantly larger than Oman's GDP of USD 115 billion. This indicates that India's economy is far more extensive and diverse.With a population of 1.4 billion compared to Oman's 5 million, India represents a vast consumer market for Oman.""However, Oman's higher per capita income (USD 25,060) compared to India's (USD 2,370) could mean a demand for more diversified and possibly higher-value goods and services in Oman, which India could aim to supply,"" Srivastava said, adding Oman might use this FTA to diversify its economy, reducing dependence on oil and gas sectors, and to develop its human resources by gaining access to India's educational and technological expertise.He added that the reduction in import duties under the CEPA will allow Indian products to enter the Omani market at competitive prices. India' diverse range of products, from pharmaceuticals and textiles to technology and agriculture, will gain a significant advantage, enhancing India's export potential.Similarly, Oman's products, particularly in sectors like oil and gas, petrochemicals, and certain types of manufactured goods, will find a more receptive market in India. Reduced import duties mean these products can be offered at more competitive prices, potentially increasing Omani exports.""Beyond the immediate economic benefits, the CEPA holds considerable strategic importance for India. It serves as a gateway for India to strengthen its footprint in Middle Eastern economies. This partnership with Oman can act as a catalyst, enhancing India's geopolitical presence and fostering deeper ties with other Middle Eastern countries,"" he added."
681,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/address-drivers-range-anxiety-over-inadequate-ev-charging-networks-11890441.html,Address drivers' range anxiety over inadequate EV charging networks,"December 12, 2023 10:52 AM IST","Poor availability of charging is one of the main reasons potential EV buyers cite in holding them back from a purchase. Those consumer doubts, in turn, have encouraged a widening group of automakers to slow down their targets for going electric. This could become a vicious circle","Just as battery-powered vehicles hit a tipping point where their cost plunges below that of conventional cars, a fresh hurdle risks holding back the EV revolution: charging networks.The Biden administration’s $7.5 billion plan to build a chain of electric filling stations across the US has yet to connect a single socket, Politico reported last week. China, home to nearly two-thirds of the world’s public charging points, is still struggling to connect them in rural areas, making long cross-country drives in EVs an anxiety-inducing proposition.Across the world, networks can barely keep pace with the uptake of vehicles themselves. At the COP28 climate summit in Dubai, the UK government saw fit to boast about its latest investment in boosting highway rapid chargers — but the spending in question was a paltry £70 million ($88 million).That’s a profound problem. Poor availability of charging is one of the main reasons potential EV buyers cite in holding them back from a purchase. Those consumer doubts, in turn, have encouraged a widening group of automakers to slow down their targets for going electric. This couldbecome a vicious circle, as a smaller-than-expected fleet of battery cars shrinks the future revenue pool for charging companies, which in turn pull back investment and exacerbate car-buyers’ worries about finding a plug socket.It’s a classic example of the 80-20 principle. At a guesstimate, 80 percent of the costs of EV charging are incurred in places that make 20 percent of the revenue. To fix drivers’ range anxiety, the most pressing need is for a robust network out on the highways. The expense of building in such places is far higher, though, given the additional cost of transmission lines, transformers and back-up batteries in remote areas that aren’t used to such intensive grid demand.Some of these problems are baked into fuel retail. If gas station ownerswant to avoid horrendous queues at peak times, they need to install so many pumps that the forecourt is deserted most of the day, leading to poor returns on investment. It’s rare for big downstream oil companies to do much better than cover their costs of capital. The majority of money is often made from the big markups for snacks at the on-site convenience store. Those problems are likely to be identical whether the fuel is electricity or gasoline.There are some unique problems for EVs, however. Drivers of conventional cars can only buy their fuel at a gas station, originally built by monopolistic integrated giants such as Shell Plc and Standard Oil Co. that could make their money upstream at their oil wells and refineries. EV drivers, on the other hand, can refill at home with electricity far cheaper than a charger could afford to sell.These challenges are not so very different to some of the coordination problems transport networks have faced for hundreds of years. The solution has always been for the government to recognise the importance of such infrastructure for national unity and security, and use its budget and influence to force a solution.The US Transcontinental Railroad was first mapped out by the Secretary of War as a defense project. Funding came from government loans, bond sales and land grants in the midst of the American Civil War. The state-built Trans-Siberian railway, similarly, was essential in the emergence of Russia as a power in Asia as well as Europe.Or consider the US Interstate Highway System. As a young officer in 1919, the future President Dwight Eisenhower had taken part in a military convoy that took two months to drive across the US. Decades later, as commander of Allied military forces in Europe, he had noticed how the Nazis’ newly built autobahns made it far easier to move his troops through Germany. The ultimate price tag for the Interstate that he signed off on came to more than half a trillion dollars in current money, orders of magnitude more than Washington is now spending on EV chargers. The economic benefits of the network, however, mean that it pays for itself every year.Electrification of road transport is a national security issue, too — something China, with its vast dependence on imported fuel and strongly pro-EV government incentives, intuitively understands.It’s considered jejune to remark on it too loudly, but oil prices give Moscow and Riyadh a tool to meddle in the politics of car-driving democracies. Former President Donald Trump spent months before the 2018 US midterms nagging the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries over Twitter to increase production, and was rewarded with a Saudi supply and export boost that helped ease crude prices by about 16 percent in the month before the poll. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman threatened “major economic consequences” for the US amid a dispute over production levels last year, the Washington Post reported in June.The world’s three-biggest democracies — the US, India and Indonesia — go to the polls next year, and fuel prices are likely to be an issue in each election.

One government official told Moneycontrol that AI is primarily responsible for the increase in detection of tax evasions, leading to the surge in the number of notices.","As sectors such as online gaming, insurance and airlines, among others, grapple with a flurry of notices over evasion of Goods and Services Tax (GST), a debate has ensued on the processes in place, especially the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect mismatches in payments.In the previous financial year alone, AI was responsible for identifying GST mismatches to the tune of Rs 30,000 crore, of which the finance ministry has recovered Rs 15,000 crore so far, a senior ministry official told Moneycontrol.Central tax officers are said to have sent around 33,000 GST notices so far to businesses for discrepancies in GST returns for the period pertaining to 2017-18 and 2018-19. The recent spike in the number of notices has sparked concerns over increased scrutiny of businesses. In fact, another senior government official confirmed that AI is primarily responsible for the increase in detection of tax evasions, leading to a higher number of notices.While, the Centre has sent 71 show-cause notices to online gaming companies alone, involving GST evasions worth Rs 1.12 lakh crore in 2022-23 and the first seven months of 2023-24, as many as 15 insurance companies, including Bajaj Allianz, Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance, and HDFC Life Insurance are alleged to have evaded Rs 2,350 crore in GST so far. Other sectors such as aviation and shipping are also under the radar of tax authorities.Experts say that given the sheer volume of show cause notices from the government pertaining to GST evasions, the authorities should be watchful of relying entirely on this emerging technology, since it cannot substitute the skills of an officer.Sudipta Bhattacharjee, a partner at Khaitan & Co, says that AI should not replace human intelligence, especially when it comes to tax administration.“Though AI is a great tool to spot trends, unfortunately what is happening now is that the government is blindly using AI to send notices to assessees. Non-application of the human mind before sending a tax notice is also legally problematic as it is considered grounds for squashing a notice,” Bhattacharjee told Moneycontrol.But, according to four officials from the finance ministry’s revenue department, who spoke to Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity, AI is used only to identify mismatches in GST payments, after which the administration takes a call on whether to issue a demand notice for that particular case.Bhattacharjee, however, claims that a lot of the notices in the case of GST are a result of mismatches flagged by AI alone, with minimal or no application of the human mind.Gunjan Prabhakaran, Partner & Leader, Indirect Tax, BDO India, however, acknowledges that use of AI assists in speedy review and correlation of various data points and identification of gaps. But, she said, the government should not “merely rely on the mismatches without inquiring for the reasons with the taxpayers.”Prabhakaran added that the tax authorities should discuss the relevant factual and legal aspects with taxpayers before issuing notices to make optimum use of AI and emerging technologies.One way to ensure better communication between the industry and the government at a time when the reliance on AI is increasing, according to Khaitan’s Bhattacharjee, is issuing an intimation notice before a show cause.“The law does provide an option for departments to issue an intimation notice before issuing a show cause. That is not being used frequently by GST authorities. With increasing adoption of AI, there should be increasing adoption of issuing intimation notices prior to show cause notices, at least for heavier tax demands. That will go a long way to ease friction and ensure that the taxpayer is not taken by surprise.”The GST law provides for an intimation notice that informs tax payers about discrepancies in their returns and seeks a response on the reason behind the mismatch within 30 days.“It is a sophisticated stage of tax administration, and it will become more like this. The case law has started falling into place, and legal interpretation is standardised. Data analytics has reduced the number of areas businesses can hide in,” said one of the officials cited above.PwC India’s Pratik Jain told Moneycontrol that the use of AI in tax administration is only going to increase, so businesses need to update their processes to ensure accuracy in payment of taxes.“There is a larger consultation required between the government and the industry as to how they propose to use new and upcoming technologies so that industry can be well-prepared. But the larger onus is on industry to ensure accuracy in the data they submit to the authorities,”  says Jain, who is national leader, indirect tax, at PwC.Going a step further, Jain says that companies should take a leaf out of the government’s book and start applying AI to analyse their data to accurately navigate the complex GST landscape."

These segments of the economy slowed down during the 2012-2019 period.The potential growth rate is an estimate of the pace an economy can grow at without causing excess inflation. An economy that’s growing faster than its potential would generally result in bottlenecks in supply, causing inflation to accelerate and putting pressure on the central bank to hike interest rates.Last month, Fitch Ratings Ltd. raised its projection for India’s potential growth to 6.2% for 2019-2027. Bloomberg Economics estimates the rate could climb to 8.5% by 2030, largely due to added capacity in manufacturing and renewable energy.India’s Potential Growth to Climb Quickly to 8.5% in Early 2030sMishra said faster growth may not stoke inflation beyond where it is now. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and fuel prices, will continue to stay low at around 4%, he said, without spelling out a duration. Food prices, however, will continue to remain volatile making it “very difficult for the RBI to cut rates,” said Mishra.However, the liquidity situation may improve, Mishra said, indirectly easing borrowing costs by about a quarter point.Last week, the Reserve Bank of India signaled interest rates will remain higher for longer as food inflation remains a concern, while revising its growth outlook to 7% for the year ending March.Interest rate cuts in the US may not automatically prompt the RBI to lower borrowing costs as the central bank would be focused on domestic inflation, Mishra said."

Only Debopam Chaudhuri, chief economist at Piramal Enterprises, expects it to be fairly stable at 4.85 percent, primarily due to slowing inflation in food items such as pulses, milk, and edible oil offsetting some of the rise in vegetable prices. Chaudhuri also expects the high discounts offered during the festive period in November across clothing and other discretionary goods, including consumer electronics, to help keep inflation in check.Food on fireAccording to data from the Department of Consumer Affairs, onion prices were up 58 percent month on month (MoM) in November, while that of tomatoes rose 35 percent. Even potato, which has been a beacon of stability in comparison to the two more volatile vegetables, saw a 2 percent pick-up in prices in November.""Uneven rainfall damaged some 2023 rabi crops and the delayed monsoon arrival caused a delayed harvesting cycle of kharif crops; together, this is causing tighter supplies,"" Rahul Bajoria, managing director and head of EM Asia (ex-China) Economics at Barclays, said.Also Read: Food inflation needs to fall more, says government sourceBajoria, though, is more worried about the price momentum in another key food item: pulses.In November, prices of the five pulses on which the consumer affairs department collates data rose by 0.1-2.9 percent MoM after posting a sequential increase of 0.8-3.7 percent in October, with tur dal being the biggest source of concern in both months.""While pulses imports are at multi-year highs, and have been on an upward trend since July 2023, this is unlikely to bridge India's sizeable demand-supply gap.

H2FY24 state income growth is anticipated to increase on a favourable basis with strong GST collection, according to the report.According to the central bank's report on state finances, the states have maintained the financial improvement, which was made in the financial year 2021-22 and was further maintained in the financial year 2022-23. The combined states' gross fiscal deficit (GFD) was contained at 2.8 percent of GDP, which is below the budget estimates for the second year in a row.According to the report titled ""State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2023–2024,"" the main way to reduce the deficit was to decrease the revenue gap while maintaining significant capital expenditures.According to the research, ""the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) has led to increased tax buoyancy for the states.""The research stated that although states' total outstanding liabilities are expected to decrease from a peak of 31 percent of GDP in 2020-21 to 27.6 percent of GDP in 2023-24, several states may still have outstanding liabilities above 30 percent of GDP.The Union government's special assistance to states for capital investment scheme helped to boost capital outlays, which increased by 52.6 percent in the first half of the current fiscal year. Revenue expenditure growth slowed to 8.9 percent in terms of expenditure dynamics. States continue to have a good budgetary outlook with increased tax income anticipated in the second half.According to the report, states' reliance on net market borrowings decreased to 76 percent in the planned GFD for 2023-2024, after a considerable increase in the previous financial year. According to the research, gross market borrowings rose to Rs 7.58 lakh crore in 2022-2023 despite certain states having decreased borrowings during the previous two years. In 2022-2023, the net market borrowings rose by 5.4 percent, with a concentration in particular states.The ratio of revenue expenditure to capital outlay (RECO), which was 6.0 in the preliminary accounts of 2022-2023 but is predicted to drop to 5.0 in the financial year 2023-2024, indicates an improvement in the quality of state expenditures. Further, by implementing a Single Nodal Agency the Union government and the states are actively updating banking agreements, cash management procedures and money transfer systems.States have allocated 14.4 percent of GDP for revenue expenditures and 8 percent for social sector expenditures in 2023-2024. It is anticipated that committed spending, which covers administrative costs, pensions and interest payments will stay around 4.5 percent of GDP. Following a relatively quiet fiscal year, capital expenditure is expected to soar by 42.6 percent, mostly due to increased loan allocations under the Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment.With the help of fiscal consolidation, the debt-to-GDP ratio of the states decreased from 31 percent at the end of March 2021 to 27.5 percent by the end of March 2023. Moderation was observed in the debt service ratio, which is determined by dividing interest payments from revenue sources, the report added.States' revenue receipts increased significantly in the fiscal year 2021-2022, which was a result of the lockdown measures being loosened and the economy picking up speed afterwards. This rise in tax income, including personal taxes and tax devolution, as well as non-tax revenues, was the main driver of this spike in revenue collections, which essentially made up for lower central grants.The spending dynamics patterns show that revenue expenditure as a proportion of GDP fell in 2021-22 compared to the pandemic high in 2020-21. This decrease is a sign of attempts to cut expenditure on COVID-related expenses and budgetary consolidation. Notably, funding for several development-related initiatives was cut, while spending on the power industry, healthcare, and public health rose in response to the states' reaction to the pandemic's second wave."

India’s growth estimate is based on a 1 percent growth in labour productivity, a 4 percent growth in capital formation, and a 2 percent growth in TFP. If we break down the TFP, the agriculture and industry TFP growth is unlikely to be more than 1 percent. However the aggregate TFP is strong because of services growth, thanks to domestic factors, retail trade, etc. I do not see much friction in the export of services. I do not see any risk to TFP because of global issues,” Mishra told CNBC TV18 in an interview.India is likely to see higher growth against earlier estimates of 6.5 percent as the economy is doing well due to the increase in private capital expenditure, which is not a surprise, he said.“It’s time to upgrade the trend growth because private capex has kicked in. This growth is not a surprise. The economy is doing very well. Also, the 7 percent GDP growth estimate is on the back of fiscal tightening, and the government is likely to stick to its fiscal consolidation roadmap. It is also on the back of interest rates being jacked up and tight liquidity conditions. And it is despite exports slowing very sharply. Policymakers need to worry about trade barriers,” he said.If the fiscal deficit is rising, it supports GDP growth, and if it’s shrinking, it's a drag on GDP growth. US GDP growth is supported by a doubling of the fiscal deficit. But in India, fiscal deficit is a headwind for GDP, he said. “Indian growth is despite the fiscal consolidation. It hurts GDP growth as of now,” he added.Mishra feels it is important for India to continue to gradually pace its fiscal deficit and not go for a drastic consolidation.“The pace (of reduction) of the fiscal deficit is important. It’s important to reduce the fiscal deficit by 50-70 basis points (bps), not 100 bps, and rein it down in a gradual fashion. If debt-to-GDP is reduced too fast, things could go wrong,” he said.India is still behind its pre-pandemic growth estimate roadmap and more work needs to be done on the labour and capital expenditure front to achieve it, Mishra added.During 2011-12, a GDP growth rate of 8 percent was seen as the trend growth,  which shrank to 6.5-7 percent from 2015 onwards, and during Covid, economists thought it would go lower. The growth slowdown before Covid was due to a slowdown in capital formation, Mishra explained.Trend growth is the long-term increase in GDP caused by an increase in a country's productive capacity.“We are still 1.3 years behind the pre-pandemic growth path. There is spare capacity that needs to be filled on the labour and capex side. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a growth booster because it will improve productivity. AI will be supportive of higher growth,” he emphasised."

In a written reply to the Lok Sabha, Sitharaman said India's retail inflation has declined from an average of 7.1 per cent in April-October 2022 to 5.4 per cent in the corresponding period of 2023.""The retail inflation is now stable and within the notified tolerance band of 2 per cent to 6 per cent. A steady decline in core inflation, estimated after removing volatile food and fuel items from retail inflation, has been critical in weakening the inflationary pressure in the Indian economy,"" she said. The core inflation rate has declined from 5.1 per cent in April 2023 to 4.3 per cent in October 2023.The minister said retail inflation in India has been mostly within acceptable limits after the notification of the inflation tolerance band in 2016. ""Temporary increases in inflation on a few occasions are caused by demand-supply mismatches arising out of global shocks and adverse weather conditions,"" Sitharaman added.Proactive supply-side initiatives by the government and effective demand stabilisation measures by the Reserve Bank of India have helped resolve the demand-supply mismatches and rein in inflation, she added. The measures taken by the government to restrain inflation include strengthening buffers for key food items, making periodic open market releases, easing imports of essential food items through trade policy measures, and preventing hoarding through imposition/revision of stock limits, and channelling supplies through designated retail outlets.To ensure food security for the poor, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which provides free foodgrains to about 81.35 crore beneficiaries, has been extended for five years with effect from January 1, 2024. In October 2023, the government also increased the subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana from Rs 200 to Rs 300 per 14.2 kg cylinder."
690,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/global-oil-in-softening-mode-bonanza-for-india-11887221.html,Global oil in softening mode: Bonanza for India,"December 11, 2023 03:52 PM IST","The war in Ukraine had led to a spike in India’s oil import bill in the last fiscal. But softening oil prices aided by difference in OPEC+ on cutting production, muted demand from China, and swelling US inventories positions could leave the Indian exchequer with a lighter oil import burden compared to 2022-23","Global oil prices have been softening for the past two months despite continuing geopolitical tensions. The phenomena of lower prices has defied predictions by investment agencies that had forecast oil skyrocketing in 2024. Instead, 2023 is ending with oil markets in bearish mode and the benchmark Brent crude being quoted at a low of 75 dollars per barrel. Unless the situation alters gravely over the next six months, it looks as if Goldman Sachs’ gloomy expectation of crude soaring to 100 dollars per barrel by the end of next year has little chance of becoming a reality.OPEC Machinations FailThe current depressed state of oil markets comes after the peak of mid-October when prices had touched 92 dollars per barrel. This was a reaction to the decision by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend their voluntary output cuts of 1.3  million barrels per day (bpd) for another three months. The momentum of  higher rates could not be maintained in the following weeks due to several factors.The first is the failure to maintain production quotas by members of the oil cartel now known as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus due to the addition of Russia and other allies to the group. Several members have been exceeding their listed quotas including Iran and Venezuela which are exempt due to the sanctions. Other countries like Angola and Nigeria have felt the need to produce more oil to generate enough revenues for their exchequer.The differences within the cartel came to light at the recent OPEC plus meeting where African producers were reported to be concerned over the proposed output cuts of 2.2 million bpd scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. The latest visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Saudi Arabia indicates the growing concern of OPEC+ leaders over the inability of the cartel to operate as a cohesive unit.US Shale Output, Muted China DemandThe second significant reason behind softening prices has been the rising output of US shale oil producers. While OPEC+ is cutting back on production, shale oil production has reached record levels of 13.24 million bpd in September. So efforts to create shortages in the market and push up prices have not met with success. On the contrary, there has been a rapid fall in prices of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude from nearly 90 dollars per barrel in early October to 77 dollars by the end of November. It even fell below the 70 dollar barrier over the past few days after rebounding to 71 dollars.Yet another factor contributing to the dip in oil prices is the growing perception that global demand is set to fall in the coming year. The focus is on China, the world’s largest oil buyer, where imports are reported to have fallen by about nine per cent in November. There are also concerns over sluggish economic growth in that country. Added to that is the recent downgrading of that country’s sovereign debt rating by credit rating agency, Moody’s. Even demand from India, the third largest importer, has been muted in November after rising steeply in the previous month. Simultaneously gasoline inventories are reported to be rising in the biggest oil consumer, the US.India BenefitsThe cooling of world oil markets has taken place in the backdrop of continuing geopolitical tensions including the Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas war. Prices had spiked initially after the West Asian flare up but now there is a perception that this will remain a regional issue and not become a wider war involving other countries. Concerns are thus centring over excess supply of oil into the market given the inability of OPEC+ to contain output along with falling demand in key economies like China, India and the US.The impact of lower oil prices, however, comes as a bonanza to India which imports over 85 percent of its fuel needs. The oil import bill had risen sharply in 2022-23 owing to the volatility caused by the war in Ukraine. It had gone up from $121 billion in the previous year to $158 billion. But if crude prices continue their softening trend for the next few months, the burden on the exchequer may end up being lower than in the last fiscal.The outlook is benign from this country’s point of view as prices now look set to remain in the low $80s in the first quarter of 2024. Yet volatility cannot be ruled out given the unpredictability of geopolitical conditions in recent years. Thus for the time being it would be prudent to continue existing policies of diversifying sources of supply by  enhancing purchases from Russia and reducing dependence on West Asian suppliers. This approach must be sustained to ensure that the country’s long term strategic fuel security needs are fully met.Sushma Ramachandran is a senior journalist based in Delhi.

Re-localisation of manufacturing to places where cheap reliable green energy is produced is needed, Ricardo Hausmann, founder-director of Harvard Growth Lab, said","Saying that non-fossil fuel sources present a growth opportunity, Ricardo Hausmann, the founder-director of Harvard Growth Lab, added that the next government, which comes to power in India after the 2024 general election, needs to focus on producing more renewable energy and become a part of the global value chain as it’s a growing economy.The government that is formed after the general election in 2024 should focus on three priorities towards sustainable energy, including manufacturing renewable energy, reducing local pollution and India becoming a part of the global value chains, the senior Harvard professor said.“India’s emissions are one-seventh of the emissions per capita of the US. First, India is a growing economy and needs to produce enough energy. Second, improve the atmosphere because of local pollution. Third, building major solar panel factories can get India into many value chains. India also has plenty of potential to develop hydropower in the Himalayas, Nepal and Bhutan,” Ricardo Hausmann, Founder and Director of Harvard Growth Lab, Harvard University, told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.The share of renewable energy, including hydropower, in India is likely to touch 40 percent by 2030 from the current 23 percent, according to a report from research agency ICRA.“One reason to develop green energy is because the world needs to decarbonise. India has to move its energy-intensive activity towards green energy. Re-localisation of manufacturing to places where cheap reliable green energy is produced is needed,” said Hausmann.He said that the question before the next government will be if India can become a major provider of green energy, which is a growth opportunity.“India will benefit from manufacturing things that the decarbonising world will need. It can be a growth strategy,” he said.India has been deploying renewables at a rapid clip and has promised in its nationally determined contributions to increase green energy capacity to as much as 50 percent of its total power generation capacity.The challenge of carbon reduction is what the countries need to do to lower emissions. However, focusing only on reducing emissions is looking at it wrong because it does not explore efficient opportunities that are growth-enhancing.“The world is not going to decarbonise by each country focusing on their decarbonisation. For that, the countries need many things that enable them to decarbonise. If these things are not produced in enough quantities and their prices are going to go up, how will decarbonisation become affordable? So it’s important the world produces more of the things that a decarbonising world will need,” the Harvard professor said.It has led to the ridiculous situation of asking countries like Bolivia, which is sitting on the world’s largest lithium reserves of the world, to lower emissions, Hausmann said.“It is in the world's favour for Bolivia to develop lithium to produce more batteries, electric vehicles and lower emissions globally. Countries need to focus on what they can produce — solar panels, windmills, electrolysers — that can enable the world to lower emissions. It's a more win-win frame that developing countries should think of,” he added.Under the Indian government’s production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, a US-based company is building a manufacturing unit of solar modules near Chennai.The New Delhi Declaration adopted in September by the G20 nations during India's presidency said all member nations “will pursue and encourage efforts to triple renewable energy capacity globally through existing targets and policies, as well as demonstrate similar ambition concerning other zero and low-emission technologies, including abatement and removal technologies, in line with national circumstances by 2030”.The countries that constitute the G20 account for over 80 percent of global emissions and a collective effort by the grouping to decarbonise is a crucial step in combating climate change."

We have data till the eight months of the fiscal and usually the collections are better in the first half. So, at the moment, we will stick to the Budget numbers in our Revised Estimates (RE),"" an official said.For 2023-24 (April-March), the Union Budget had pegged total tax collections at Rs 33.61 lakh crore, up 10.1 per cent from Rs 30.54 lakh crore in the previous year.In the current fiscal, Rs 18.23 lakh crore is expected to be collected in direct taxes (personal income tax and corporate tax), and Rs 15.38 lakh crore from indirect taxes (GST, Customs, excise).The revised estimates for current fiscal's revenue numbers would be presented as part of the vote on account or interim budget to be presented by the Union finance minister on February 1, 2024, in Parliament.Asked if there could be a cut in taxes on petrol and diesel, the official said the prices of brent crude have already cooled in the international markets and there is no case for a cut in excise duty on fuel.India is dependent on imports to meet nearly 85 per cent of its oil needs and so benchmarks local fuel rates to international oil prices. ""When crude oil prices were high, we cut excise duty. When prices have already cooled, the question of tax cut is not there. You can ask for price cut (of petrol and diesel), but it will not be because of cut in taxes,"" the official said.Brent crude prices stood at USD 76.40 a barrel in the futures market early on Monday. Excise duty on fuel was last cut in May 2022 to cool inflation. The central excise duty on petrol was then cut by Rs 8 per litre and on diesel by Rs 6 per litre. Excise duty on fuel was last cut in May 2022 to cool inflation."

India’s consumption growth remains relatively weak, and  investment growth is still riding on government capex. While hopes are building up for a private sector-led capex cycle, this has been the narrative for quite some time","The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) December policy meeting, for a change, sprang no surprises. After a surprise incremental CRR (I-CRR) in August, and the spectre of OMO (open market operation) sales and regulatory action on unsecured lending, a policy without any surprises was quite welcome. In keeping with the current inflation and growth mix, the RBI rightly retained a hawkish tone. However, a fresh mention of the “risk of overtightening” partly offset that and provided a more balanced tenor.Markets at large will parse this new language carefully. Despite the RBI explicitly mentioning that a shift of stance to neutral is not on the cards, expectations will probably build up for one, possibly over the next few policy meetings. We believe that this could be the first step in what will be a gradual shift to a neutral stance from the current “withdrawal of accommodation."" But it is too early to shift given the expected inflation trajectory.Headline inflation has been impacted by food price shocks even as core inflation has come off to around 4-4.5 percent. Headline inflation will possibly climb back to around 6 percent in November and December given higher food — especially vegetable — prices. Kharif crop production has been weaker than last year (per first advance estimates), while the ongoing rabi season, with a healthy pace of sowing to date, remains under the cloud of El Nino. The RBI will need to be vigilant against any second-order effects from these price spikes.On the global front, the markets seem to be expecting a gradual moderation in global growth, and inflation steadily coming closer to target with multiple rate cuts for the company. At the same time last year, near-certain recession fears combined with multiple rate-cut expectations dominated the outlook for CY2023. Quite the opposite panned out. It is fair to say that market expectations need to be taken with a pinch of salt.The comfort on the domestic growth front continues for the RBI. In fact, the RBI believes that its upwardly revised real GDP growth estimate of 7 percent for FY2023-24  is conservative. Over the first three quarters of FY2024-25, RBI’s growth estimate remains centred around 6.5 percent. Consensus views seem to suggest negligible chinks in India’s growth profile.However, we would prefer to exercise some caution. India’s consumption growth remains relatively weak, and investment growth is still riding on government capex. Hopes are building up for a private sector-led capex cycle, especially after the general elections in April-May. This has been the narrative for quite some time, though, to be fair, we have seen some pick-up in a few sectors such as power, telecom, and refineries, over the past couple of years.In a scenario where: (1) inflation is moderating but with substantial upside risks; (2) the growth profile is stable and moderate with some downside risks; (3) global growth, inflation, and rate cycle have multiple uncertainties, a wait-and-watch policy remains the best choice. We maintain our view of a prolonged pause by the RBI (at least until H1FY24-25), with liquidity kept on a short leash.  The RBI would want to retain the flexibility to act according to the evolving global and domestic situation. In that context, the more balanced tone of the December policy will go a long way.zThe author is the Senior Economist of Kotak Institutional Equities.

That has helped. More important factor is to have inflation under control, than to reduce rates. It has worked so far. I would rely on the experts of the RBI to manage the economy which they have done very well so far.""He further said that once the economy is set on a good track with longer term perspective and there is room for rate cut, ""industry would welcome it at that point"".The Reserve Bank, it may be mentioned, has not tinkered with the short-term interest rate (repo) since February 8, 2023.

But Mamata is no pushover unlike Mulayam in his last days ","The rumblings of discord in the Trinamool Congress are growing louder even as Mamata Banerjee is hogging the limelight nationally by simply being herself – which includes shaking a leg!She purposefully took aim at the Congress Party licking its wounds after the rout in three key states, refusing to attend an INDIA bloc meeting convened by Mallikarjun Kharge. Importantly, she didn’t budge despite Rahul Gandhi’s telephone call. She merrily stayed put in Kolkata where she danced with Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, Mahesh Batt, Shatrughan Sinha and Sonakshi Sinha, at the inauguration of a film festival. And, as expected, central minister Giriraj Singh’s Jashn mana rahi hai, thumke laga rahi hai, yeh uchit nahi hai jibe has triggered protests in Kolkata and Delhi by senior women Trinamool MPs and MLAs bringing Mamata back in the national spotlight.Echoes Of The SP ChaosEven as Mamata’s bargaining power in the opposition alliance has shot up after the Congress Party’s debacle, the intra-party feud in the Trinamool Congress between the old guard and younger party apparatchiks is not only out in the open but is worsening. The power struggle between veterans loyal to 68-year-old Mamata and those owing allegiance to her nephew, heir-apparent and second-in-command Abhishek Banerjee, is somewhat reminiscent of the infighting between the coteries of Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh in Uttar Pradesh, which took a very serious turn in the politically significant state in the run-up to the 2017 elections.The Samajwadi Party was evicted from power in 2017 and Mulayam Singh Yadav is no more but the infighting carries on. In comparison, the internal conflict in the ruling Trinamool Congress runs deeper and is becoming increasingly bitter and irreconcilable. Some are even spying an Ajit Pawar syndrome at play in West Bengal given the Bharatiya Janata Party’s strategy of engineering splits in dynastic political parties to bring them crashing down.While this writer doesn’t foresee West Bengal going the Maharashtra way, the widening rift between old-timers and the new generation of leaders does not bode well for Mamata’s Trinamool Congress in the long run. The new-versus-old narrative playing out daily in the print and electronic media fuelled by remarks and retorts, is corroding the party’s standing and credibility ahead of the do-or-die general elections in a few months. The divide has been growing since 2021 with the 36-year-old Abhishek’s rise even as the party was voted to power for a third successive term keeping the BJP at bay.Shadow BoxingThe face of the Young Turks is journalist-turned-politician Kunal Ghosh who rose to become a Rajya Sabha MP. Known as a diehard Abhisekh loyalist, he is currently the Trinamool Congress spokesperson. Recently, he set the cat among the pigeons by publicly asking why Abhishek’s photograph was not displayed at a party meeting in the Netaji Indoor Stadium which Mamata, no less, addressed.Choosing his words with infinite care, Kunal said: “It is not about Mamata Banerjee versus Abhishek Banerjee as they are a team. The party needs both of them and their contributions are essential. However, I feel any major Trinamool Congress programme can’t be held without Abhishek Banerjee. As he could not attend the meeting due to his health, his photo should have been put on display. The stage was incomplete without the presence of Abhishek Banerjee or his photograph. He has sacrificed a lot for the party and elevated himself to a position where he cannot be ignored anymore. He is essential for the party.”Did Mamata have a premonition that Kunal would take up cudgels for Abhishek? Intriguingly, she pointedly told the party meeting held in the Netaji Indoor Stadium – where neither Abhishek nor his photograph was there – that party seniors must be given due importance. Referring to her statement, Kunal said: “Seniors indeed deserve adequate respect. But it doesn’t mean they will continue to occupy posts and juniors will continue to struggle for years. It is for the seniors to decide when they hang up their boots. MPs who are old or not keeping well should consider sitting at the party office and guiding the new generation instead of becoming MPs and MLAs.”Sougata Roy, the 76 year old Trinamoool MP, staunchly aligned with Mamata, lost no time in taking on Kunal for demanding that Abhishek’s photograph should have been displayed at the party meeting. Returning Kunal’s fire, the party veteran said: “Mamata Banerjee has the last word in the party. Abhishek Banerjee is also our leader and he is popular among the young generation. However, it is not necessary that Abhishek Banerjee’s photograph be there in every Trinamool Party programme. Mamata Banerjee’s photograph was there and that is enough.”Old Guard Vs Young TurksOther old timers entrenched in the Mamata camp are Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim, Subrata Bakshi, Purnendu Bose, Sudip Banerjee, Kalyan Badopadhyay, and many more key ministers and organisational leaders. Significantly, the three senior-most Trinamool Party heavyweights presently behind bars on corruption charges – Partha Chatterjee, Anubrata Mondal and Jyotipriya Mullick – are Mamata loyalists.Besides Kunal, prominent pro-Abhishek figures are Transport Minister Snehasis Chakraborty, Irrigation Minister Partha Bhowmick, Education Minister Bratya Basu, Planning and Statistics Minister Tapas Roy, MLA Madan Mitra, social media and IT cell chief Devangshu Bhattacharya, Trinamool Youth Congress chief Sayoni Ghosh and Trinamool Chhatra Parishad’s Trinankur Bhattacharya. There are fence-sitters too like Power Minister Aroop Biswas who have their feet in both camps.The tussle between the old and new guard is all about controlling the functioning of the Trinamool Congress, especially decision-making. A few months ago, Abhishek forced Mamata’s right-hand man, Firhad, to roll back a hike in parking fees charged by Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Abhishek also ensured that Partha, who has close ties with Mamata, was dropped from the cabinet and stripped of party posts within nine days of his arrest.Even as Mamata was exulting over the Congress Party rout, Abhishek fired another volley demanding a retirement plan for politicians on the grounds that advancing years take a toll of productivity. He said that there is a retirement age in every profession and service and added that cricketers and footballers too hang up their boots. Out of 23 Trinamool Congress MPs, 10 are over 65 – and among them five are more than 75.Importantly, Mamata had recently ruled out any age limit for contesting assembly or parliamentary elections. But Abhishek is suddenly singing an altogether different tune. His insistence on compulsory retirement for politicians has the potential to unleash demands for fielding younger candidates in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, exerting pressure on many Mamata loyalists and raising the morale of his own group.SNM Abdi is an independent journalist specialising in India’s foreign policy and domestic politics.

And that’s not a bad thing,"December 11, 2023 09:22 AM IST","The number of corporate types turning up at climate conferences should be taken as a positive, rather than a negative indicator. Global commerce has long structured itself around trade fairs, expos and conferences that commonly host 10,000 people at a time. Where the suits lead, money follows","There’s a common lament echoing through the halls of Expo City Dubai, the 1,000-acre conference venue where the COP28 climate conference is being held: This event feels more like a slick trade show than an environmental summit.About 100,000 attendees — nearly three times the number who attended COP26 in Glasgow two years ago — are milling through the venue. Fossil fuel companies have more than 2,000 representatives attending — including Sultan Al Jaber, the president of the conference as well as the chief executive officer of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, the United Arab Emirates’ state-owned petroleum business. Lavish provision of food, drink, events, and golf buggies to ferry delegates around the vast site make it feel as much like an industry conference in Las Vegas as a sobering reckoning with environmental catastrophe.Climate activism, meet capitalism. You two should get to know each other better.This isn’t a frivolous point. Since the industrial revolution, our civilisation has been built around fossil fuels. Fixing the resultant emissions can be likened to digging out the foundations of the global economy and resetting them on a new, cleaner footing. It’s an extraordinary stroke of luck that we now have most of the technologies needed to not only achieve this objective, but to do so at a lower cost than the carbon-intensive alternative. Getting that new economy built, however, is going to involve one of the biggest splurges of peacetime investment the world has ever seen.Just how big? To a rough approximation, the world spends between $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion a year on its energy systems, around the annual gross domestic product of France. Only in the past few years has clean power started to decisively overtake fossil fuels to take the majority share of that budget, but things still need to accelerate.Clean energy investment in 2030 must be roughly double the $1.7 trillion spent this year if the world is to meet governments’ existing commitments, according to the International Energy Agency. That rises to about $4.5 trillion if we’re going to put the world on a sure path to zero emissions.Renewable capacity worldwide is already sufficient to power China, the US and Europe at peak output, but leaders of the Group of 20 major economies have promised to triple it by 2030. All those wind turbines, solar panels and transmission lines won’t come cheap — and the funds aren’t going to be mobilised by peer-reviewed studies or protest placards.For too long, global capital has underestimated both the threat and the opportunity of the energy transition. It’s no bad thing that it’s waking up to both sides of the equation.The recent surge in prices for fossil fuels and the crisis in the offshore wind industry helped give the carbon producers some of their confidence back in 2023. Current ebullience looks like turning into the hubris that has long plagued the sector whenever the investment cycle peaks, however. On a 10-year timeframe, renewable power companies still do a better job of covering their costs of capital than petroleum businesses and fossil-powered utilities.In that sense, the number of corporate types turning up at climate conferences should be taken as a positive, rather than a negative indicator. Global commerce has long structured itself around trade fairs, expos and conferences that commonly host 10,000 people at a time. Where the suits lead, money follows.Visitors to the 500-desk media center in Dubai — one of the biggest pavilions at COP28 — could be forgiven for thinking otherwise, but the $1.7 trillion emerging clean-energy economy remains woefully under-explored, especially compared to the coverage we lavish on a stagnating petroleum industry that invests less than half that amount. This imbalance will only grow as the likes of CNBC and Vox lay off climate reporters.It’s certainly true that the epic scale of COP28 may be too much of a good thing. Trade shows thrive on intimacy as much as scale. Dealmaking is fueled by the opportunity for in-person meetings, something that is made a lot harder when getting to the far side of the venue resembles crossing the concourse of Grand Central Station 10 times in rush hour.The green economy already has plenty of its own industry events, too. So it’s certainly true that spreading some of the load back to those conferences would give diplomats at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change more breathing space to do their own important work. Still, from the dawn of industrial capitalism we’ve recognised that altruistic ends are often achieved through unedifying greed. It’s not, as Adam Smith wrote, “from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.”If big business is finally recognising that its self-interest converges with that of the planet, that’s not a bad thing.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

705,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-market-outlook-after-a-strong-run-expect-consolidation-11883191.html,"Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | After a strong run, expect consolidation ","December 11, 2023 02:39 PM IST","Nifty closed the week higher for the 6th consecutive week, the swing has cooled off in the past few days and the Nifty index has consolidated during the same time","Dear Readers, In a spectacular display of market dynamics, Indian financial markets soared to new heights last week, achieving significant strides within a remarkably brief timeframe and marking their most substantial weekly gain in the past 16 months. The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) performance in the state elections undeniably fuelled the impetus behind this bullish surge. The markets commenced the week with a notable gap-up opening, sustaining an upward trajectory as traders hastily covered their short positions.Benchmark indices shot up by 3.47 percent during the week, which saw renewed interest on Friday after the RBI announced its credit policy and revised its growth forecast from 6.5 percent to 7 percent.Besides favourable political and economic conditions, fund flows further supported the market. Foreign investors made a formidable entry into the Indian market, aggressively rectifying their short positions in the derivative market and assuming substantial positions in the cash market.Typically, following a rapid rally, the market undergoes a consolidation phase, patiently awaiting the next catalyst to determine its future trajectory.An Over-heated Market Nifty closed the week higher for the 6th consecutive week and at 20969 trades in new territory. As per the Fibonacci retracement/extension, 21050–21100 is likely to be a significant resistance level on the way up. In the forthcoming trading sessions, if the Nifty index is unable to close and sustain above 21100 and instead closes below 20700, then the breakout may start looking like a bull trap.A large part of the rally in the market was FIIs covering their short positions and going long in the market (index futures) with 36,502 contracts. There is still room for them to increase their position to 60,000 contracts, considered an overbought zone, as seen in the chart below.Source: web.strike.moneyWhile FIIs have gone long on the market, clients have started shorting it. The clients' positioning in the index futures suggests we are closer to the top. Currently, it stands at 46,381 contracts. In July, the client’s net short position in the index futures was around 75000 contracts. The implication is that the Nifty index can form a medium-term top. A break of support level or closing below short-term daily averages will be an initial warning of a top formation.Source: web.strike.moneyThe swing has cooled off in the past few days and the Nifty index has consolidated during the same time. The last time something similar happened was two weeks back. The Nifty index consolidated for a few days and the swing reading corrected from 92 and nearly fell to 28 levels. Once the Nifty index broke out from the consolidation zone, it saw a 1000-point rally.However, in the recent runaway rally, the swing topped out at 75, and it has started to decline, indicating a loss of momentum on the upside. The past three days' low was around the 20850 level, an important support level to watch out for in the near term. A close below 20850 can lead to a short-term correction. On the flip side, if 20850 holds on a closing basis and the swing starts inching higher, we can expect a continuation of positive momentum in the near term.Source: web.strike.moneyOptions DataOptions data also suggests consolidation ahead. Call writers have been aggressive towards the second half of the week as profit booking started in the market, as seen in the chart below.Source: ichart.inPresently, the market is evenly poised with put writers almost matching the call writers. Even the highest call and put open interest position is only one strike apart, indicating not much movement in the market, unless there is a sharp move, which can lead to a panic covering of position in either direction.Source: ichart.inIndices and Market Breadth After a long time the frontline stocks gave the smaller indices a run for their money. While the benchmark index gained 3.47 percent during the week, BSE Small-cap, BSE Mid-cap, and BSE Large-cap indices rose 3.8 percent, 2 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively and also touched record highs. Nifty touched the 21,000 level briefly before closing at 20,969.BSE Power index was the star performer of the week, rising 13 percent, followed by BSE Oil & Gas index rising 7.6 percent, and the BSE Bank index up by 5.3 percent. BSE FMCG index moved in the other direction, falling 0.3 percent in the week.Among the top stock performers of the week were Spencer Retail rising 51 percent, BCL Industries up by 35.69 percent and 63 Moons Technologies gaining 27.60 percent.Among the losers were sugar counters led by Uttam Sugar Mills at 21.48 percent, Avadh Sugar & Energy at 18.39 percent and Balrampur Chini at 16.71 percent.The week saw FIIs continued buying and injecting Rs 26,505 crore into the Indian equity markets in the first six trading sessions of this month. During the week, FIIs bought Rs 9,285.11 crore, while domestic institutions bought Rs 4326.47 crore worth of shares in the cash market.Global MarketsWorld equity markets had a good run during the week, with the US markets closing higher for the sixth week running. The S&P 500 rose 0.21 percent, recording its longest winning streak since November 2019. The Dow closed marginally higher with a gain of 0.01 percent to post its sixth straight weekly gain. Nasdaq gained 0.69 percent during the week.US markets were bullish on hopes that the Fed has finished raising rates.The European markets also closed in the positive for the fourth consecutive week. While the DAX closed 2.21 percent higher, CAC closed 2.46 percent, and FTSE gained 0.33 percent. The All European Euro Stoxx 50 gained 2.35 percent in a week.Asian markets, however, underperformed, with the Japanese Nikkei closing 3.36 percent lower on fears that the Bank of Japan might abandon its negative interest rate policy sooner than expected.Shanghai fell by 2.05 percent and Hang Seng by 3.01 percent after rating agency Moody’s cut China’s outlook from “stable” to “negative”.Stocks to watchThough the market is expected to consolidate, some stocks continue to show strength. Stocks where strong momentum is expected to continue are Axis Bank, Can Fin Home, India Cements, PFA, REC, SBI Life, and Titan.Cheers, Shishir Asthana"

708,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/economy/policy/food-on-fire-how-has-the-government-tackled-the-inflation-inferno-11883241.html,Food On Fire: How has the government tackled the inflation inferno,"December 11, 2023 02:15 PM IST","The retail prices of key agricultural produce such as rice, wheat, onion, and sugar have been on an upswing in the last six months. Notwithstanding the government’s efforts, Crisil expects prices to remain elevated due to supply-side issues.","After food prices hit record highs this year, the Centre has been fighting on a war footing to put the inflationary genie back in the bottle. General elections are round the corner, and Prime Minister Modi and his team are acutely aware that high onion prices have flattened governments earlier.India's headline retail inflation rate crashed past the upper bound of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) tolerance range of 6 percent in July, and shot up to a 15-month peak of 7.44 percent, spurred by a massive increase in vegetable prices, data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) on August 14 showed.Inflation numbers have eased since, dropping to 4.87 percent in October, thanks to timely government intervention to quell the prices of  various commodities. Analysts say the government’s interventions, while helping mitigate  inflation, would have adversely impacted farmer incomes.OnionOnion prices have been volatile since they first rose in August. Soon after, the government imposed an export duty of 40 percent as they saw that a rise in exports was causing prices to spin out of control.While the move helped for a bit, prices began to rise again in September, but plateaued at under Rs 50 per kg in the retail market.As festivities drew closer, onion prices resumed their climb in October and went up to Rs 80 per kg in various markets across the country. On October 29, the government imposed an MEP (minimum export price) of $800 / tonne till the end of year to discourage exports and ensure  domestic supplies. This resulted in immediate price correction in the Maharashtra wholesale markets, the Centre said in an official statement.“We have arrested the rising prices. People were expecting it to go up to Rs 100 a kilogram. That will not happen, thanks to our proactive measures,” Consumer Affairs Secretary, Rohit Singh had told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview.The government also announced that it will  build a buffer stock of seven lakh tonnes to keep onion prices under check. It has since been disbursing onions in retail outlets across the country.On December 7, with the average retail price of onion at Rs 57 per kg, the government banned the export of onions until March 2024. On-year inflation in onion prices, per data shared by Crisil, stands at 90 percent in December.SugarIndia, the world’s second largest sugar exporter, has suffered continuous setbacks with respect to this essential commodity. Below-normal showers in the top cane-growing districts in the western state of Maharashtra and the southern state of Karnataka, which together account for more than half of India’s sugar output, have been a cause of worry for the government.As the country grapples with rising inflation, reduced sugarcane production, dwindling supplies, and a looming fear of El Nino, the government has chosen to be safe than sorry.A central directive  on October 18, 2023, imposed restrictions on sugar exports till further notice.But despite restrictions, prices rose by 1.5 percent, from Rs. 43.96 / kg in Oct '23, to Rs 44.62 / kg in Nov '23, said Pushan Sharma, Director, Research, Crisil Market Intelligence and Analytics.Additionally, on December 7th, a new notification was released banning the use of sugarcane juice / syrup in ethanol production.“It is anticipated that with the restriction on the use of sugarcane juice for ethanol production, sugar output would increase by 2.5 million tonnes,” said Pushan, adding that sugar production is now expected to be 32 million tonnes against earlier estimates of 29 million tonnes in the 2023-24 sugar season  (October 2023 to September 2024).Domestic prices of sugar have remained elevated, up about 5 percent in December compared with last year, per government data.Rice and wheatThe retail prices of key agricultural  produce such as rice, wheat, onion, and sugar have been on an upswing in the last six months.In the case of rice, the price rise has been to the tune of 11-12 percent on-year. In order to tame the same, the government has banned the export of non-basmati white rice in July 2023. Later, it imposed a 20 percent duty on the export of parboiled rice, initially till October 2023, which was then extended to March 2024. The government has also announced the disbursal of 25 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the open market sale scheme (OMSS) to cool prices.However, Crisil expects prices to remain elevated owing to anticipated lower stocks of rice in the country.In the case of wheat, there’s been a 6-7 percent on-year increase in prices. Apart from a ban on wheat exports from May 2022, in June 2023, the government imposed a stock limit of 3,000 tonnes for wholesalers and traders, and 10 tonnes for small retailers, to control the price rise. Further, the government has also disbursed 30 lakh metric tonnes of wheat under OMSS from June 2023 to moderate the prices.The government is also dispensing atta at a discounted price  of Rs 27.5 per kg in areas where wheat or atta is consumed more, especially in the northern parts of the country.The government is crunching huge numbers every day to decide points where this subsidised commodity will be sold. “The distribution centres are fully data-driven. Every day I get price points from 550 places in the country. We use absolute prices and how far they are from the national average, as well as historical trends, to determine where Bharat atta will be sold,” Singh had said in the interview.On December 8, the government further reduced the wheat stock limits for traders / wholesalers, retailers, and processors by 50 percent.A Crisil assessment shows that in spite of the government’s measures, 35–40 percent lower stocks compared to the average of the last five years is expected to keep wheat prices firm.On-year inflation in wheat and rice, per data shared by Crisil, stands at 7.2 percent and 13.3 percent, respectively, in December."

The maximum loss was expected in Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Chennai and Chengalpattu districts, which account for more than 3.5 lakh industries, he added.An estimated 25 lakh persons based in the four districts have faced the economic brunt due to the cyclone, Raghunathan reportedly said, adding that they include those involved in the MSME sector, along with those working as street vendors, gig workers, auto and taxi drivers, daily wage earners, contractors, perishable goods sellers and traders.Also Read: Cyclone Michaung | ‘Expect droughts and floods to become more extreme whenever they occur’The AIE chief appealed to the government to cancel property tax, metro water and sewerage taxes in the four districts for three months, and direct the state-run Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation (TICC) to grant loans at concessional interest for refurbishment and repair of rain-affected machinery.The state government should also request the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to offer three months moratorium on term loans for businesses affected in the Kanchipuram, Tiruvallur, Chennai and Chengalpattu districts, he further added, as per the report.The cyclone triggered torrential rainfall in several parts of Tamil Nadu since December 5. It made landfall in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh on December 6. The flooding caused due to the incessant rainfall claimed the lives of at least 14 persons, most of them in Chennai.The city and its adjoining parts are home to the local arms of leading global companies such as Daimler, Hyundai Motor and Taiwan's Foxconn and Pegatron, that manufacture products of tech giant Apple.While a bulk of the companies, including Foxconn and Pegatron, resumed operations by December 7-8, some of the production plants located in low-lying inundated regions were yet to resume operations, reports said."

Before this, overseas investors withdrew 39,300 crore in August and September, data with the depositories showed. Going forward, FPI inflows are likely to continue, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, said.According to the data, FPIs made a net investment of Rs 26,505 crore in Indian equities in this month (till December 8). Kislay Upadhyay, the founder of FidelFolio Investments, attributed the FPI inflows to the outcome of major state elections that signalled political stability going forward..""The indication of political stability after the 2024 General elections, strong growth momentum in the Indian economy, inflation cooling off, steady decline in US bond yields, and the correction in Brent crude has turned the situation in India's favour, "" Vijayakumar said. Globally, the US Federal Reserve signalled potential rate cuts starting from the first quarter of next year, indicating a shift away from the high-interest rate environment. This change led to the weakening of the US dollar against other currencies, Himanshu Srivastava, Associate Director Manager Research, Morningstar Investment Research India, said.Moreover, the decrease in US Treasury Bond yields has prompted foreign investors to re-evaluate investing in Indian equity markets, considering its improving risk-return profile, he added. In terms of sector, FPIs have turned buyers into leading banks where they have been sellers. Large caps in segments like IT, telecom, automobiles and capital goods are also witnessing buying.With regards to bonds, the debt market attracted Rs 5,506 crore during the period under review. This came after receiving a six-year high inflow of Rs 14,860 crore in November and Rs Rs 6,381 crore in October, data showed.

The year-on-year CPI decline was the steepest since November 2020.The numbers add to recent mixed trade data and manufacturing surveys that have kept alive calls for further policy support to shore up growth.Xu Tianchen, senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said the data would be alarming for policymakers and cited three main factors behind it: falling global energy prices, the fading of the winter travel boom and a chronic supply glut.""Downward pressure will continue to rise in 2024 as developers and local governments continue to deleverage and as global growth is expected to slow,"" Xu said.Year-on-year core inflation, excluding food and fuel prices, was 0.6%, the same as October.Bruce Pang, chief economist at Jones Lang Lasalle, said the weak core CPI reading was a warning about persistently sluggish demand, which should be a policy priority for China if it is to deliver more sustainable and balanced growth.Although consumer prices in the world's second-biggest economy have been teetering on the edge of deflation in recent months, China's central bank Governor Pan Gongsheng said last week inflation was expected to be ""going upwards"".The producer price index (PPI) fell 3.0% year-on-year against a 2.6% drop in October, marking the 14th straight month of decline and the quickest since August.

The RBI reiterated that policy must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure fuller transmission and anchoring of inflation expectations and that past hikes so far are still working their way into the economy. But overall there was a sense of comfort in the policy tone, which was no surprise given that a benign global narrative, tighter domestic system liquidity and steady easing core inflation despite stronger growth acted as a comfortable backdrop for the December MPC meeting.Fears of financial stability risks have taken a back seat amid swift changes in global risk appetite and low volatility in FX and other asset classes. This contrasts with the previous RBI meeting in October, when UST10Y was on its way to touching 5.0 percent and global commodity prices were moving higher.Goodbye OMO sales, but active liquidity management remains a policy watchWe reckon that the policy prerogative was to ensure financial stability in the October meeting. The external dynamics were very different. We believe OMO sales were merely announced last time as a way to depict implied policy bias for higher rates and a way to offer higher risk premia to the world and to anchor INR – none of which turned out to be a worry. As we stand today, (1) a US Goldilocks scenario dominates the world narrative, UST yields have changed gears and while INR has stayed well-anchored; (2) the India-US 10Y spread has widened to ~300 bps after having seen the decadal lows of ~240bps in mid-October 2023, and (3) the average spread between weighted call money rate and repo rate has since widened to 20 bps (versus 2 bps average in September 2023. Going ahead, we expect liquidity to stay comfortable and range-bound in the near term but will likely tighten by March 2024.Policy reversal to be a function of global dynamicsThe swift change in global risk appetite is backed by higher market conviction of a wider runway for a soft landing and the Fed’s terminal state (a US Goldilocks scenario). The rates market now incorporates relatively high probabilities of easing by both the Fed and ECB, next quarter, led by better-than-expected recent inflation reports. This has probably led to the RBI mentioning for the first time the need to be mindful of the risk of overtightening – albeit on account of possible large global structural changes, and geopolitical and geo-economic shifts.As market debates shift to timing/quantum of rate cuts ahead, the RBI’s mention of the “risk of overtightening” amid a fluid global backdrop strengthens our view that domestic policy reversal will be a function of global dynamics. We maintain that the RBI will not precede the Fed in any policy reversal in CY24 but policy management will have to stay vigilant and the policy tools will need diversification from conventional to unconventional ones.(The writer is Lead Economist, Emkay Global Financial Services)"

The backdrop to this policy was a slowing inflation, especially as the worst of vegetable price increases is beyond us. The markets held on their nerves pre-policy as the RBI had been seen springing some surprises in the past, not from the rates side but in terms of its actions on liquidity.While, like many central banks across the world had extended their balance sheets to fight the COVID crisis, return to a normal period led to most to soak out the excess liquidity. So did the RBI and while its traditional tools were failing to do the trick, the RBI had surprised the market in August with its announcement of I-CRR and further at the October policy, the RBI brandished the OMO as a tool to absorb liquidity. This policy, thankfully, for the market, did not any such surprise.On the other hand, the markets are reading this policy as being with a bit of dovish tilt. This is first since the RBI has now reduced the risk of any immediate OMO (open market operation) and further, the speech of the Governor highlighted that the RBI would have to be mindful of the “risk of overtightening”. However, in the press conference, the Governor dispelled any thoughts of the RBI moving into a “neutral” policy stance soon.Also read: Monetary Policy: RBI improves economic projections…how soon will rate cuts follow?In my opinion, the RBI would want to be driving cautiously and consistently look for speed bumps ahead and to avoid any accidents. The Governor points out, “Policy makers have to be mindful of the risk of being carried away by a few months of good data or by the fact that CPI inflation has come within the target range.” This is probably playing out world over and even as inflation prints in the US have started to soften, the US Fed continues to harp on keeping policy in a restrictive zone.Importantly, world over, the sanctity of the target rate for inflation for monetary policy making has gained prominence. The RBI lauds itself and its policy making to say that by prioritizing inflation ahead of growth and by hiking policy rates and tightening liquidity, core inflation has trended lower. Thus, monetary policy is doing the job. But the 4 percent target remains elusive. The RBI has not changed its projections for inflation for Q3 and Q4 FY24 and have retained these at 5.6 percent and 5.2 percent respectively.Also read: RBI MPC Highlights | Pause no signal of neutral stance, inflation top priority: Guv DasFor Q1 FY25, the inflation projection is currently placed at 5.2 percent (again unchanged from the previous assessment). For Q2, FY25 the RBI projects inflation to be at 4.0 percent but this would be largely due to the base effects from the previous year. Further, for Q3 FY25, inflation once again is seen jumping back to 4.7 percent. So, there appears to be a very limited window of opportunity when policy interest rates can be reduced.There are multiple issues at hand. First, core inflation is coming down and is firmly in the 4 percent handle. But remember, GDP growth estimates have been pushed higher by the RBI to 7 percent for FY24 from the earlier 6.5 percent. And the momentum seems to remain strong, whereby the RBI projects GDP at an average of 6.5 percent for the first 3 quarters of FY25. The moot question here – following various policies of the government, has the potential growth risen so sharply already. If not, and I doubt it has, are there signs of the economy overheating. And if the potential growth is not at 6.5 percent, then it is very difficult to see inflation dropping down to the target levels on a sustainable basis.Also read: RBI retains FY24 CPI inflation forecast at 5.4%, sees it at 4% in Q2 FY25For now, the risks continue to remain loaded towards the supply side dynamics for price determination. There have been major changes globally to the supply chains and continuing geopolitical and geo-economic shifts create uncertainties. Globally, climate change is an issue and supply worries on the food front remains an issue. Ageing population world over is leading to higher dependency ratios and lower savings and investment. This also is creating the worry of a structurally higher inflation globally.Finally, closer home, climate change issues have created worries about domestic food price inflation. We did come out of a tomato shock around July/August, but right now, potato, onion and tomato prices are again on the higher side. Cereals is giving some headaches and so is pulses. And the RBI themselves point out that going ahead, “inflation outlook would be considerably influenced by uncertain food prices”. RBI is already expecting a higher inflation print for November and December. Further, rabi sowing is still weak and needs to be monitored for emergence of food price pressures in the future months.On liquidity, the RBI is probably likely to maintain liquidity just adequate – not too much that it fuels inflation, not too little that it jacks up short-end yields and chokes growth. The positive for the market is that the RBI has lowered the probability of an OMO on an immediate basis, but they have not reduced the chances of the same to zero. In the current uncertain scenario, it would be very difficult to estimate liquidity on an ongoing basis and would crucially be determined by the extent of flows from the globe to India.In the press conference, the Governor pointed out that there is a positive buzz around India and India will also start benefiting from the Bond Index Inclusion starting June 2024. But some flows can front-run this event and the OMO could be a useful tool at that point. The OMO thought could also have emanated from the low interest rate differential between India and the US. Remember that in October 2023, US interest rates were on an upward journey while India yields had not been moving higher by any significant extent. Now US yields have fallen faster than India’s and has opened the gap between the two, hence also reducing the chance of an OMO immediately.Thus, the “higher for longer” story remains relevant. It could also be difficult for the RBI to cut rates ahead of the US Fed as the interest gap between India and the US remains to anchor the currency. Assessing the growth-inflation dynamics, we think that the RBI may only get a chance to cut rates around the August 2024 policy.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, along with it the chargesheeting rate, which is used to measure police performance, has also gone down. Meanwhile, analysis of data shows that although the unemployment rate saw a dip in November, it remains elevated compared to the longer-term trend.","The Weekly Numerics column features three to five charts based on major events or interesting data points that emerged during the week. Here are some of the key figures of the past seven days.Crime rate declinesIndia recorded as many as 35.61 lakh crimes under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in 2022, according to the latest data from the Crime in India report published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Along with cases registered under the Special & Local Laws (SLL crimes), nearly 58.25 lakh cognisable crimes were recorded during the year.On a positive note, the total number of crimes recorded under the IPC has gone down marginally during the year, as can be seen from the chart below.There has been a decline in the crime rate as well, which is the number of crimes recorded per lakh population. The crime rate in 2022 was 258.1, down from 268 the year before.However, the overall police chargesheeting rate also saw a decline for the second consecutive year. Chargesheeting rate refers to the share of cases in which the police reached the stage of framing charges against the accused after necessary investigation, and is considered to be a better indicator of police performance. Between 2020 and 2022, the overall chargesheeting rate has gone down from 75.8 to 71.3.Increase in suicidesThere was an increase in both, the number of suicides and the rate of suicides (per lakh population) in the country in 2022, according to the NCRB’s recently released report titled ‘Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India’.The total number of suicides recorded in the country went up from 1.64 lakh in 2021 to nearly 1.71 lakh in 2022. Meanwhile, the rate of suicides marginally rose from 12 to 12.4.Among states, Maharashtra recorded the highest number of suicides in the country at 22,746, followed by Tamil Nadu (19,834) and Madhya Pradesh (15,386). When it comes to the rate of suicides, Sikkim tops the list with a suicide rate of 43.1. However, among bigger states, Kerala recorded the highest rate of suicide (28.5), followed by Chhattisgarh (28.2).Out of nearly 1.23 lakh male suicides, the maximum number was recorded among daily wage earners (41,433), followed by self-employed persons (18,357) and professionals/salaried persons (14,395). Meanwhile, as many as 48,172 females committed suicide in 2022 in the country. Of the women who committed suicide, the highest number (25,309) was registered among housewives, followed by students (6,113) and daily wage earners (3,752).Rise in deaths due to heat strokeAfter two consecutive years of decline, India saw a rise in the number of people who died due to heat/sunstroke. The number of persons who died due to heat strokes went up from 374 in 2021 to 730 in 2022.ALSO READ: As India simmers, data on heatwave-linked mortality turns foggyIt needs to be noted that the NCRB figures for previous years are higher than the figures maintained by the National Disaster Management Authority and the Indian Meteorological Department. A previous report by Moneycontrol had explored the inconsistencies between these datasets and how only NCRB has the resources required for such data collection, and yet, how the figures are likely to be under-reported.Unfortunately, as 2023 has now become the hottest year in recorded history, the number of heat stroke-related deaths is likely to have increased during this year.Unemployment rate remains high despite a marginal dropAlthough the unemployment rate in India declined marginally to reach 9.2 in November 2023, from 10.1 a month before, a look at the larger trend shows that it remains elevated.The unemployment rate has seen an overall rise in recent months and remains higher than the longer-term average recorded since the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, recent months have displayed increased volatility, with the average monthly unemployment in the first 11 months of 2023 being 8.2 percent, the highest since 2017, excluding the strict lockdown in 2020.“The 10.1 percent unemployment rate of October and its moderation to 9.2 per cent in November should be seen in the light of the above trend. The November print is a fall in a rising trend. Furthermore, the fall is at least partly explained as a seasonal phenomenon,” said the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) in a recently published report.The decline in the November unemployment figure is largely due to a rise in labour demand in rural areas, as the harvesting of kharif crops and sowing of rabi crops happens during this month.Moreover, the overall decline in the unemployment rate during the month is despite an uptick in the urban figure. The urban unemployment rate went up from 8.4 in October to 9.4 in November."

Global yield lowers, GDP growth for FY24 now projected at 7 percent and CPI inflation for April-December 2024 projected at 4.63 percent. Some segments of the market were expecting the RBI to accelerate (change the stance to neutral), however RBI chose to play defensive and be in “wait and watch” mode, kept the rates unchanged and maintain the withdrawal of accommodation stance. We believe RBI will start accelerating (change the stance to neutral) from April 2024 policy.The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) met amid strong growth in Indian economy reported in H1FY24. It was the fifth bi-monthly monetary policy of FY24 and decision was unanimous to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.50 percent and majority of 5 out of 6 members voted to remain focused on ""withdrawal of accommodation"". The monetary policy was broadly in line with the expectation. Since May 2022, there has been a cumulative rate hike of 250 basis points undertaken by the MPC, which is still working its way into the economy as per the RBI.The MPC was positive on domestic growth outlook. According to RBI, though the global economy is showing signs of slowdown (unevenly across geographies and sectors), Indian economy remains resilient and has shown momentum. India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth surprised positively at 7.6 percent YoY in Q2FY24, exceeding all forecasts.On the back of the turnaround in rural demand, increase in general government capex, healthier banks’ and corporates’ balance sheets, strengthening of manufacturing activity, high capacity utilisation, revival in private sector capex and other improving macro fundamentals, real GDP growth projection for FY24 was increased significantly from 6.5 percent to 7 percent, higher than the market expectation of ~6.7 percent.Also read: Monetary Policy: RBI improves economic projections…how soon will rate cuts follow?The RBI kept its FY24 consumer price index (CPI) inflation forecast unchanged at 5.4 percent. CPI inflation number for April-December 2024 is projected at 4.63 percent, broadly in line with the expectation. Though core inflation has been trending lower and CPI headline inflation has subsided over the last few months (falling below 5 percent in October), CPI inflation is expected to rise again in November and December, on account of uncertain food prices, especially intermittent vegetable price shocks and elevated global sugar prices. Thus, the MPC statement retained the need to stay highly alert around the inflationary trends, prepared to undertake policy action as required to ensure a durable alignment of inflation to the target rate of 4 percent, while supporting growth.The RBI has been proactive in managing liquidity. It has stayed ahead of the curve with timely reduction in balance sheet size from 28.6 percent of GDP in FY21 to 23.3 percent in FY23 and further to 21.6 percent this year, up to December 1. The RBI remained focused on liquidity management in its statement.Also read: RBI Policy: No forward guidance again from Governor Das, but clues remainSystem liquidity turned to deficit mode in September after four years and deficit liquidity conditions persisted during October and November, tightening more significantly than envisaged in last policy. This prevented the need to conduct OMO-sales (open market operations sales) so far. With government spending expected to pick up, liquidity conditions may ease. At the same time, the RBI is cognizant of the risks of the over tightening and will remain nimble in liquidity management.Real policy rates based on current overnight operating rate is close to ~2 percent, which is restrictive and hence made the case for change in the MPC stance to neutral. With global central banks yet to pivot and April-December 2024 growth projected at 6.5 percent, gives the flexibility to RBI to continue with the same stance.We expect the Fed to pivot in 1st quarter of CY2024 only. Hence, we believe RBI will likely change the stance to neutral starting early FY2025 only.The market reaction has been muted as the policy was broadly in line with expectation. The 10-year G-sec is expected to trade in the band of 7.15-7.30 percent in the near term.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Against this backdrop, the RBI Governor has judiciously conducted his policy rate manoeuvring, with majority votes for the decision of status quo in policy rates. This RBI decision is welcome, despite all the trade-offs it entails","The RBI held its last Monetary Policy Committee deliberations of 2023 during December 6-8, 2023. As expected, RBI has not deviated from its primary mandate of bringing price stability, and to tame inflation back to the official nominal anchor of 4 percent. The RBI Governor has clearly articulated that his prime aim is inflation containment. Therefore, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent. The monetary policy stance of “withdrawal of accommodation” is maintained rather than switching to a “neutral stance”.The monetary policy corridor is defined by the lower bound of SDF and upper bound of MSF. The December 8 announcement by RBI maintained a symmetrical monetary policy corridor with SDF rate at 6.25 percent and the MSF rate and the bank rate at 6.75 percent. The symmetrical corridor is translated as both SDF and MSF are equidistant from the policy rate at 6.5 percent.MPC’s Prudent CallGiven the global headwinds, he communicated effectively that RBI is maintaining a status quo in its policy rates at 6.5 percent. There is a growing recognition that the global economy is facing a “poly crisis” emanating from war, climate change crisis, energy crisis and debt crisis. These crises culminated into a prolonged period of “volatility”. While the central bank left the policy rates untouched at high levels to stabilise prices and to tackle the poly crisis, we should not forget the tradeoffs. The tradeoffs include the slowdown in global growth and severe debt crisis.Also read | No impact on home loan interest rates for now, as RBI leaves repo rate unchangedInflation targeting and public debt management never go hand in hand. The ”party is over”, of low interest rates regime. Now given the hawkish trend in interest rates, the public debt management is becoming costlier. Fiscal policy is continuing to remain accommodative to avert a global recession. Accommodative fiscal stance with high public debt and deficits in the post-Covid era needs an effective rollback as it should not culminate into severe fiscal risks. The combined fiscal-monetary risks and climate change related risks can trigger an irreversible threat to the global economy. Against this backdrop, the RBI Governor has judiciously conducted his policy rate manoeuvring, with majority votes for the decision of status quo in policy rates. This RBI decision is welcome.The RBI announcement effects can be multifold. The monetary policy tightening has led to inflation containment though CPI is slightly above the nominal anchor. The Monetary Policy Committee deliberations have projected CPI inflation at 5.4 percent for 2023-24, with Q3 at 5.6 percent and Q4 at 5.2 percent. CPI inflation for Q1 2024 is projected at 5.2 percent, Q2 at 4 percent and Q3 at 4.3 percent. It is surprising to note that RBI MPC has slightly revised the growth projections upward, despite the downward risks from the global economy. The RBI Governor Dr Shaktikanta Das articulated that the inflation targeting ""cannot be on autopilot,"" acknowledging that CPI inflation could be above the nominal anchor. This is all the more relevant because India cannot afford to be in a prolonged negative interest rate regime.The RBI MPC announcement on December 8 revealed that the real GDP growth for 2023-24 is projected at 7 percent, up from the earlier 6.5 percent. The GDP growth for Q3 is projected at 6.5 percent and Q4 is projected at 6 percent. The RBI Governor said that GDP is likely to grow at 6.7 percent in Q1 2024, 6.5 percent in Q2 2024, and 6.4 percent in Q3 2024. Does this optimism about economic growth figures suggest a “decoupling” or a retreat from globalisation? There is an increasing trend towards reshoring, nearshoring and “friend-shoring” globally. The RBI Governor reinforced that India’s economy is resilient, despite the fragility of the world economy, and therefore RBI has revised the GDP growth figures upwards.Regulatory FrameworksThe RBI Governor announced that a fintech repository will be operationalized in April 2024 to understand the fintech ecosystem, and for strengthening the partnership between banks and fintech firms. The RBI Governor also said that the UPI transaction limit for payments made to hospitals and educational institutions be enhanced to Rs 5 lakh from the previous Rs 1 lakh.However, extreme caution is required when banks deal with fintech firms, and it is highly relevant for the banks to diversify its portfolio rather than disproportionately focusing on fintech firms, which can create a financial exuberance and in turn a fintech bubble.The significance of scaling up Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is also crucial, and clarity regarding CBDC is awaited from RBI. CBDC is indeed the digitized legal tender. However, immense ambiguity remains on how UPI and CBDC co-exist in India in the coming years.The Pause And Its ConsequencesThe RBI Governor has articulated that his pause in the rates cannot be misunderstood as peak rate. The MPC Statement mentioned that the next MPC meeting will be conducted during February 6-8, 2024. If the inflation containment is successful by February 2024, will RBI think of decreasing the policy rates then?This question can be answered only after we understand the mood of the US Federal Reserve in the upcoming Jackson Hole meetings. If the US Fed Reserve continues to be in hawkish mode, and if Jay Powell increases policy rates, it will have further adverse consequences on emerging market economies. RBI will continue to be in “interest rate defense” mode if such hawkish announcements persist, to avoid capital flight from the Indian economy.Also read | RBI MPC: Limits for UPI transactions, e-mandates for recurring online payments raisedTo prevent Current Account Deficit (CAD) from widening, we are financing the CAD with capital inflows. In 2013, India tried capital controls to prevent volatility in currency markets, however it was partially effective. So RBI will continue to be on interest rate defence mode. It has three advantages and two disadvantages. The advantages of a high interest rate regime are inclusive of protecting financialisation of savings, per-empting a capital flight and also to tackle the mounting inflation. However the disadvantages are economic growth recovery will slow down as the credit will not be cheaper for investment upturn, and public debt management will also be costly.In February, India will also confront an Interim Budget before the general elections. Given the hawkishness in interest rates, the debt servicing burden and fiscal risks are mounting. It is highly likely that there will be no major fiscal announcements in the Interim Budget 2024-25 before elections. Given the constrained fiscal space, India will remain firm on fiscal arithmetic, with the medium term fiscal glide path of fiscal deficit towards 4.5 percent by 2025-26.Lekha Chakraborty is Professor, NIPFP and Member, Board of Management, International Institute of Public Finance, Munich.

But by reading in between the lines – however hazardous that might be – a picture of how Indian monetary policy is evolving can be discerned,"For an interest rate decision that could be seen coming a mile away, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had plenty to say on December 8. And while much of it was about how nothing could be said about the future course of monetary policy, a little bit seems to have crept past the Indian central bank.First and foremost, just as the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was unanimous in its decision to leave the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent, central bank watchers were also clear that the RBI has become less hawkish since October, making the policy review ""an anti-climax of sorts,"" according to Aurodeep Nandi, Nomura's India economist.""In the run-up, there was considerable market uncertainty on the extent of hawkishness that the RBI would exude, particularly given the focus on tighter liquidity in the past two meetings. Instead, the RBI surprised markets by choosing to not reprise its previous hawkishness, especially through the liquidity route,"" Nandi added.Indeed, Governor Shaktikanta Das said in his statement that the need to conduct open market operation (OMO) sale of government bonds – to suck out excess liquidity from the banking system – that he had mentioned in October had yet to arise as conditions had tightened due to factors beyond the RBI's control.And while the governor was able to return the loose OMO cat back to the bag, his calculated decision to mention that policymakers have to be ""mindful of the risk of overtightening"" may have gone astray, with economists immediately latching on to it as a sign of balance and maybe even the stance of policy being changed soon.Das did clarify that ""it would be a mistake to read that we are giving any kind of a signal, that we are moving towards neutral"" – especially given that headline retail inflation is expected to rise to almost 6 percent in November. But the RBI's forecasts are not completely on his side.4% ahoy!According to the RBI's latest forecasts, Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation is finally seen averaging 4 percent in July-September 2024, meaning that it would hit the medium-term target after almost five years. CPI inflation was last at the target rate in September 2019, when it had come in at 3.99 percent.Also Read: One year gone, one more to go on RBI's post-failure path to 4% inflationThe central bank's pursuit of 4 percent inflation assumed greater significance after it failed to meet its mandate in 2022, following which it had to submit a report to the central government detailing the reasons for the failure, the remedial actions it proposed to take, and an estimate of the period within which inflation would return to 4 percent on a durable basis. The key phrase here is 'durable basis,' which Das repeated today.""Reaching 4 percent should not just be a one-off event… The MPC should have confidence that, yes, 4 percent has now become durable,"" the governor said.As it turns out, after falling to 4 percent in July-September 2024, the RBI sees CPI inflation rising to 4.7 percent in the subsequent quarter. And we know that more than one-quarter of inflation forecasts of 4 percent or close to 4 percent is needed to nudge the MPC into easing financial conditions.""Thus, it may be safe to say, and keeping in mind the credibility of the central banker, there is unlikely to be any chance of a rate cut till that time, unless, of course, something dramatically changes,"" said Indranil Pan, YES Bank's chief economist.Regarding rate cuts, the question is when, and not if. According to Debopam Chaudhuri, chief economist at Piramal Enterprises, this could begin as early as the first quarter of 2024. The consensus, though, is closer to the middle of the next calendar year. A smaller number see the window of opportunity appearing only in the last quarter of 2024.For all the uncertainty, the sands of Indian monetary policy have been rather very clearly defined. Last year, FY23, was the year of the great rate hike cycle, as the MPC rapidly raised the repo rate by 250 basis points to 6.5 percent. The current, FY24, has so far seen the rate-setting panel stay pat. The next, FY25, looks set to be about the reduction in interest rates."

The US arm of the Aditya Birla Group’s aluminium and copper flagship, Novelis, may see financial results improving progressively with every quarter, he added.Halfway through the pivotal UN Climate Change Conference, better known as COP28, the aluminium industry has committed to greenhouse gas reduction. Pai, who is also the Chair, International Aluminium Institute, spoke exclusively to Moneycontrol on decarbonisation, his company, and his first visit to COP.Edited excerpts follow:The aluminium industry has committed to back a new initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. How will this work?Aluminium plays a big part in electrification. The reason why the aluminium industry has come out so strongly and launched this initiative is because it is also an electricity-intensive industry. We want to make sure that the aluminium that we produce has low carbon (emissions). So that it is very clean and transparent, the International Aluminium Institute has come out with a methodology and a way to track and report what each member company commits to and what they actually do.ALSO READ: MC Exclusive: COP28 has been “practical”, aluminium industry committed to reduce greenhouse gas emission: Hindalco MDThe group wants to declare a long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 31 December 2024—preferably net-zero by 2050. How much investment would this require? The investment profile is different, depending on the region you are in. If you are in Europe, you have access to hydropower and you have less of an investment to make. But I think what we should focus on is what they call the Global South…the majority of our power is from coal. To decarbonise our electricity profile and the grid, this is where the majority of the investment will have to go.If you look at India, where the majority of our power comes from coal, to decarbonise our electricity profile and the grid will require major investments.The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, or CBAM, which will force foreign importers to cover the cost of their carbon emissions, kicked in on October 1. How prepared are Indian metal manufacturers for it?It is a given that there will be some sort of a carbon tax in most countries in the long term. Europe is normally ahead of the pack and has announced it. The Indian government is in active discussions with the industry and other stakeholders to put some sort of a carbon trading mechanism. Most companies are quite well aware that there’ll be some sort of a carbon tax coming in most countries; they aim to be world players and are preparing for this.There are some serious challenges the aluminium industry faces in turning green. By its very nature, it needs uninterrupted round-the-clock (RTC) power, and while India has developed renewable energy capacity significantly, RTC is still at an early stage. What is Hindalco doing in this respect?Yes, just renewables on its own is not going to solve industry’s problem for baseload power. Hindalco’s RTC power contract Greenko, where we are using pumped hydro, actually got selected in COP28 — it was one of the projects that got an award. The concept is that we will be using a combination of solar, wind and pumped hydro to give us an 85 percent load factor. We are actually going to start using this in our Aditya smelter from the third quarter next year. If we can make this work, then this gives us a line of sight to decarbonise the aluminium smelting chain, which is the most difficult one. We are actually quite eager to get this contract started. Just to be clear, Hindalco has a target that 30 percent of its aluminium production will be low carbon by 2030. And the pumped hydro contract is actually one of the kingpins of our strategy to make that happen.After the second quarter results, you had said that ahead of the Union Election, you expect strong aluminium and copper demand in domestic markets, driven by higher project execution. What’s your demand and price outlook for the third and fourth quarter?The Indian market demand is very good and is growing at more than 10 percent year-on-year. This is going to be driven by auto, electrification projects, building and construction sectors. I had said at the end of Q2 that LME prices will be between $2,100 and $2,300 (per tonne) and I will stay with that guidance. It is around $2,175 today; the weakness is still because of global macroeconomic triggers.Hindalco has plans to incur a capex of $4.4 billion over the next five years in India and the US. This is lower than the $8 billion announced some time back. Do you foresee any challenges that may force you to revisit this number again? And how's the capex going right now?We revisited the plan to keep the capex in line with our cash flows. When LME prices came down and there was a little bit of softness in demand internationally, we decided to go slow on the capex. I am happy to say that we see no further need to change any of our capex plans. We are going ahead with all the big projects that we announced. Just to recap, the big $2.7 billion Bay Minette project of Novelis is progressing very well. Our Aditya smelter expansion of Rs 3,500 crore in India is progressing very well. And we also announced a big Rs 1 billion greenfield alumina refinery in Odisha. So, I think that the strength of Hindalco’ balance sheet allows us to stick with our capex plans, even during these slightly softer times.Give us some perspective on what you expect from Novelis and the demand globally.The worst is over from a can market destocking for Novelis, so we are now seeing can volumes pick up. Auto demand has always been very strong—aerospace is very strong. I think for Novelis the worst is over and we are going to see progressively better results every quarter.A big concern in the industry is on the energy side, which includes both energy security and the price of energy. What is Hindalco’s strategy? Are you looking at any merger and acquisition opportunities to secure energy for your company?Not really, you see, internationally, we buy it from the grid. The only place we were worried about for Novelis is Europe, but I think this year, the prices are still at reasonable levels. So, I don't think we have much concern there. In India, power demand is extremely strong. It is fair to say that the auction prices of coal have been trending a little bit higher. But I also think that the production profile from Coal India and all has been extremely robust. I am quite confident that energy availability and coal availability to do power this winter will not be a concern in India.There are concerns that your industry has raised over dumping by China in the past. And there is also a potential opportunity for India from the ‘China plus one’ strategy that countries are looking at. How is the China factor playing out in the industry?I think you actually said it very well. On the one hand, there is a great opportunity with ‘China plus one’. So, a lot of people are coming into India, setting up capacity and we are looking to provide aluminium and copper for that opportunity. But as the Chinese economy has weakened, their aluminium industry is looking for new markets. India, the Middle East and Africa are big targets. If you look at the level of imports coming into India from China, especially foil, it has risen sharply and it's coming in at what I call lower prices than the cost of production in China. That is a concern and through the appropriate industry bodies, we have filed petitions for anti-dumping again.Metal manufacturers are vulnerable to commodity cycles and yet they have to move ahead with decarbonisation. There are factors affecting margins and then there is also significant debt on the books of most companies. How do these companies, especially Hindalco, plan to finance decarbonisation projects given this background?Our strategy at Hindalco, which we started to execute about 6-7 years ago, was that we would deleverage the company, pay off our debts, and make the balance sheet clean. This is helping us during these times, because now, interest rates have gone up. Any metal company borrowing money now is going to pay very high interest rates. The advantage of Hindalco is that our net-debt to EBITDA ratio in India is close to zero. We are generating pretty robust cash flows. Novelis is a converter with robust cashflow. So, we have the ability to invest in a downcycle, which is going on right now. And I think that’s what differentiates Hindalco versus other metal companies.We are almost midway through COP28. What is the best outcome that you are hopeful of from COP28 before it wraps up later this month?What differentiates COP28 from the other COPs is that most of the hard-to-abate sectors like oil and gas, steel, cement, aluminium, and all others are represented here by their CEOs, not just lobbyists. Let me be clear there’s no lobbyists from Hindalco here, I am here. If you want to make real action happen on climate, then it's industries and corporates like us who have to take the steps. The other bodies, the NGOs, the governments, they can make the declaration, but the action starts from companies like us. I am very hopeful because every industry that I have seen here has come in with firm commitments with projects that they’re working on. This is a transition phase so it will take some more time; but the commitment is there from all industries. It’s a practical COP, not just a COP of declarations."

Market participants are eagerly anticipating another set year of good returns as the macroeconomic indicators strengthen in India aided by steady increase in aggregate demand in the country.The ICICI Direct report gives the following reasons why it believes Nifty can rally to 23400 by June:1.      Empirically, in a general election year, Nifty has a tendency to bottom out in February-March, followed by a minimum 14 percent rally towards the election outcome in each of seven instances over past three decades.2.      Usual bull market corrections in Nifty are around 8 percent (multiple cycle average) followed by new highs. As 4.5 percent correction (from life high of 22124) is behind us, model indicate strong support in 20500-20800 which we expect to hold3.      Bottom up chart study of Nifty constituents projects further upsides across sectors and heavyweights after many stocks coming out of large periods of consolidations, thus supporting bullish stance.The report further highlights the percentage of stocks above 200-day moving average is above 80 percent even in corrective phase, thus indicating strong underlying strength, according to the Technical Strategy report by ICICI Securities.So far this year, we have seen double digit gains in Nifty Oil & Gas, Nifty CPSE, Nifty PSE, Nifty PSU Bank and Nifty Energy index. Nifty Oil & Gas index is leading the current rally, up by more than 16 percent on year-to-date basis. Index heavyweight RIL is up by more than 12 percent on year-to-date basis while ONGC and IOC have soared by more than 25 percent.On February 2 , the global markets traded with optimism even as S&P 500 made record highs and big tech companies contributed the most to the index gains.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

These entities constitute a major portion in the top 10 highest weighted companies in the index.","S&P 500 index that tracks the performance of the largest 500 companies in the US gained by 1.1 percent to close at 4,958.61, thereby making a record high on February 2.While closing higher by more than 1 percent is not something investors have not seen before, this is only the second day in 62 years when the S&P 500 jumped 1 percent on a day when there were two losers for every winner on the NYSE exchange.The other was the day after 'Black Monday' -- a reference to the unexpected massive crash of stock markets on October 19, 1987.Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 22.67 percent and S&P 500 index declined by 20.4 percent on the historic day. It was the biggest decline in a single day in the history of the US markets. The markets eventually saw fast recovery with DJIA recovering more than 500 points within a week.IT stocks continue to contribute to S&P 500 rallyIT stocks dominated the S&P 500 gains nudging the index to record highs. This indicated that the AI- powered tech boom is at play in market for 2024 as well. The tech companies contributed to around 70 percent of the S&P 500 gains in 2023. The IT sector portion of the S&P 500 index gained 57.8 percent when S&P 500 clocked gains of around 26 percent in 2023. Almost 75 percent of the S&P 500 index constituents underperformed in 2023, highlighting the dominance of the IT sector.The weightage of IT sector stocks is steadily seen increasing in the S&P 500 index. It stands at around 27 percent, highest for any single industry. The top 10 companies out of which 7 are technology related, constitute nearly 38 percent of the total market capitalisation of S&P 500 index which stands at $41.128 trillion. The biggest 10 index constituents by market capitalisation made up to 31 percent of the index market capitalisation as on August 31 , 2023.The outsized performance of the IT sector stocks and especially the ‘Magnificent seven stocks’ is responsible for the increase in the IT sector weightage in the index. Nvidia shares jumped higher by more than 213 percent in the past one year.Magnificent seven stocks includes Meta, Tesla , Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.History was created when the shares of Meta (formerly Facebook) jumped higher by 20 percent adding $204.5 billion to its market capitalisation in a single day. Before this, the biggest single day valuation gain record belonged to Amazon when it added $191.3 billion in February 2022. Meta Inc announced dividends for the first time and also declared a stock buy-back plan worth $50 billion, adding to the optimism.Why are IT stocks rallying in US?According to Rama Ratnam, Director and CIO, Centrum International Services Pte Limited, “The jump in S&P 500 index is mainly on good earnings of most mega cap technology companies barring Apple and Google which constitute a major portion in the top 10 highest weighted companies in the index. The main reason for the optimism in the big tech companies is the perceived high growth in the tech portion of the S&P 500 index versus slow growth for the others.”The reason behind the market rally, apart from the earnings growth, is the strong economic data, experts said. In such a scenario, few are preferring to trade in strong economy with lower rate cut possibility than with higher rate cut possibility and poor economic growth, they pointed out.The strong economic data is leading to higher probability of soft landing which is a positive outcome for the markets, some experts believe. The recent jump in the yield on the 10 year Treasury note in US was not high enough to stop the equity market from rallying as MSCI World Index made record highs along with S&P 500 index.It is not surprising given the mega market capitalisation combined with the growth performance of big tech companies and increased index weightage that we see the indices making new highs even as the advance decline ratio continues to be in favor of the declines while other sectors fail to deliver growth.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, it has ticked off the right boxes so far as the policy intentions of the government of the future are concerned and has also taken consolidation seriously by targeting for a 5.1 percent GFD/GDP in FY25. This is just an interim step towards the 4.5 percent FD/GDP for FY26 which the Finance Minister appear to be confident of achieving. The present government’s fundamental goal of policy making – to achieve inclusive growth and development remains intact.Indeed, in her speech, the FM laid stress on how the policies of the government have been targeted to address “systemic inequalities” in the system. The Poor, Women, Youth and Farmers continue to remain in focus. The efforts of the government with regards to boosting farmers’ incomes will be stepped up. The government indicated that the focus is on the outcomes and not on outlays with an aspiration towards achieving socio-economic transformation.Also read: FM: Growth robust; reforms yielding results, inflation manageable; open for SBI, ONGC disinvestmentWe had been indicating that with the current macro conditions, especially with real GDP growth anticipated at 7.3 percent for FY24 after a 7.2 percent in FY23, there would possibly not be any requirement for a Keynesian push. And this Budget does not take this route as there have been no changes that have been announced to the tax side. Thus, the central government has not walked down the populism route in the run-up to the Union budget. We even remain confident that the full Budget that will be announced around June 2024, the government would not want to tinker with the tax structure further and continue to focus on compliance for generation of resources.Notably, one big support to the economy during Covid and even after has been the government’s thrust on capital expenditures. And this budget has maintained the focus on capacity building through investments. While revenue expenditures are up by a mere 3.2 percent, on-budget capital expenditure budget has expanded 16.9 percent. Capital expenditures are now at 3.4 percent of GDP for FY25, compared to 3.2 percent of GDP in FY24. Consequently, share of revenue expenditure in GDP is down to 11.2 percent in FY25, compared to 11.9 percent in FY24.Also read: Nirmala Sitharaman terms Interim Budget 2024 'secularism in action'And, capex/revenue expenditure ratio has further improved to 30 percent for FY25, compared to 27 percent in FY24 – a significant positive. Important to note that the government has curtailed its budget allocations towards subsidies – specifically fertilizer subsidies. Global oil prices have proved to be volatile and given the current geopolitical skirmishes, crude oil prices have refused to move lower. In the final analysis, the government may be seen to overstep on the fertilizer subsidies.On the capital expenditure side, the focus continues to be on roads and railways, that corners around 50 percent of the capex budget. For the railways, projects have been identified under the PM Gati Shakti and aims at improving logistics efficiency and reducing costs. This is of utmost importance, given that logistics costs remain high in India, thereby restricting the competitive edge for Indian manufacturers, even as the government has long moved ahead and had reduced the corporate tax rates to ASEAN standards. The other point of highlight in the capex budget is that earmarked for defence – share of capex to this segment has now drastically reduced to 16 percent compared to around 32 percent in FY22.The big positive surprise in this Budget is to target a 5.1 percent GFD/GDP for FY25. Other important fiscal metrics, such as, primary deficit and revenue deficit are also seen to improve significantly in FY25 to 1.5 percent (2.3 percent in FY24) and 2.0 percent (2.8 percent in FY24) respectively. This has enabled the government to restrict its gross borrowing number to Rs 14.13 lakh crore for FY25, compared to Rs 15.43 lakh crore in FY24.The comfort on the supply side is also to be seen against a likely comfort from the demand side due to the inclusion of India in the JPM Bond Index. This led to a large 10 bps rally in the India G-sec 10-year benchmark yield, that closed the day at 7.06 percent and is likely to go lower to around 6.75 percent as the RBI also starts its policy rate cutting cycle sometime in FY25.Effectively, given that the risk-free yields are likely to be lower in FY25 compared to FY24, the borrowing costs of the corporates are also likely to come off. The hope here is that the private sector should again take up the mantle of capex, thereby closing the virtuous cycle and lead India to a faster and sustainable growth in the coming years.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

When the Fox Business correspondent asked him: “Is it in your view a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?” Powell said, ""I don't think it's likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that.” Since the markets were betting on a rate cut at the FOMC meeting in March, it’s no wonder they sold off.But Powell had also underlined that they were confident that inflation was slowing, and it was just a matter of time before they cut rates. All that the markets did was to price in a delay in the rate cut to the May meeting. In fact, the Fed Funds market is now factoring in a 62 percent probability that the Fed Funds rate will be 375-400 percent or lower by December 2024, compared to a 47 percent probability a week ago. The Fed Funds rate at present is 5.25-5.50 percent. In other words, as my colleague Anubhav Sahu wrote, the base case is for rate cuts, but the question is when. A day after Powell’s press conference, the US markets rebounded smartly.The IMF’s update to its World Economic Outlook added to the optimism with its heading, ‘Moderating Inflation and Steady Growth Open Path to Soft Landing’. The IMF revised up its 2024 forecast for global growth a bit and revised down its inflation projection for the advanced economies. Among the countries for which growth forecasts for 2024 have been raised are the US, China, India and, wonder of wonders, Russia. The IMF said, “The faster-than-expected fall in inflation is allowing an increasing number of central banks to move from raising policy rates to adjusting to a less restrictive stance.’’ It also said, “In many cases, amid rising debt and limited budgetary room to manoeuvre, and with inflation declining and economies better able to absorb effects of fiscal tightening, a renewed focus on fiscal consolidation is needed.’’ The Indian government responded very positively to that.The India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for January came in at a four-month high of 56.5, signifying strong expansion from the previous month. Contrast China’s 50.8 reading and the ASEAN economies’ 50.3 reading for their respective manufacturing PMIs.What’s more, animal spirits are also high in Indian manufacturing, and the survey showed that confidence in the future was at its most upbeat in 13 months. India’s exceptional performance is reflected in its stock markets.The Global Manufacturing PMI data showed that global manufacturing output rose for the first time in eight months in January. Data broken down by nation showed that output rose in China, India and Brazil (among others), and fell more slowly in the US, Japan and the Euro area. Bennett Parrish, global economist at JPMorgan, said, “The PMI subcomponents tracking new orders, future activity and employment also made advances, further raising optimism that fuller recovery could be established during the coming months. The impact of disruptions to the Red Sea shipping routes on delivery delays and prices seems minimal thus far, at least at the global level.”The confidence in the performance of the Indian economy was reflected in the Interim Budget. The Budget belied fears of populist giveaways before the national elections and instead, by slashing the fiscal deficit, sent a message that this is a responsible, conservative government, a votary of sound money. My colleague Madhuchanda Dey pointed out that the assumptions made in the fiscal maths are entirely credible. Some of our Budget analysis on the macroeconomy and the bond and stock markets are given below, in case you missed them.As for the Indian markets, they seem to have had a late realisation that the Budget was actually good for them. As we wrote here, they will now shift focus to other triggers. Attention now shifts to the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee’s next meeting from February 6-8 and we wondered whether the government’s fiscal prudence will signal a dovish pivot from the RBI.Finally, after that rather exhausting week, if you feel like reading a light-hearted, quirky and unconventional take on the Budget, here are twenty wacky responses to it.Cheers,Manas ChakravartyHere are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets:StocksPaytm, Mas Financial, Tata Steel, Sky Gold, JSW Steel, Shriram Finance, Cyient, Dalmia Bharat, Syngene, ITC, GAIL, Concor, Bajaj Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Marico, Craftsman Automation, L&T, Mahindra Finance, Petronet LNG, Cholamandalam Investment, Which life insurance company should command sector-leading valuations?, Titan, Maruti, Dabur IndiaMarketsThe best tool to spot a bull market, for freeInterim budget brings cheer to bond marketsSignalling continuity of reforms in Budget should give investors comfort10-year sovereign bond to trade below 7 percent in near termCompanies and industryITC, Bajaj Finance, Oberoi Realty, Mahindra Finance, Auto sales, Lessons to learn from the Paytm debacleFinancial TimesThe cycle vs the trend: investors need to prepare for secular changeWhy political leaders are so unpopular nowGlobal trade: the looming tensions over China’s subsidiesLEX | The days of $100 oil prices are overInside EdgeSME I-bankers’ package deal, Surya story brightens, PSU rally confounds veterans, Sanghi Inds bullsWealth God, Honey make right (s) choice in Indiabulls Housing, unseasonal Rain, SME I-bankers in SEBI's crosshairs, MFs' tried and tested formulaBlock deal Ponzi scheme has HNIs excited and brokers alarmed, IRFC’s cock-and-bull story, bears eye NBFCsEconomy and PolicyIndia-UK FTA, Pro Economic Tracker, A Made in India policy needed to create Global SMEs, Political strategy must steer rooftop solar power to the masses, Budget lays out a long-term road mapPoliticsAaya Nitish, Gaya NitishGlobal politics and economicsWhy the Evergrande crisis is not a big dealThe Eastern Window: Will the Chinese government's desperate efforts to prop up its free-falling stock markets succeed?Tech & StartupsWipro, Infosys, Cognizant CEOs shrug off poaching concernsPersonal FinanceThree sector funds in spotlight after interim Budget 2024How to scratch that speculative itch, without losing your shirtICICI Prudential MF launches a new value-strategy scheme.

While AI is poised to impact certain job roles in the economy, it will concurrently create more opportunities, Verma told Moneycontrol.His observation highlights the difference in approach towards AI between the two regions. It also reflects the broader concerns regarding many job roles being made redundant due to AI.“(In the) West, a lot of focus for AI as a replacement tool seems to be a much more dominant discussion… and in India it is people-plus-AI, and not AI removing people,” Verma said at Google’s “Research@” event held in Bengaluru on February 2.Verma is also the chief architect for various India Stack layers, such as Unified Payment Interface (UPI) and DigiLocker.""The discussion is on bringing people and AI together across the global South, as the region doesn’t have the ability to access information and knowledge,"" said Verma. And to achieve that, Verma said, AI tools’ computing and expertise need to be democratised.He strongly advocated for democratising technologies and inducing AI in digital public infrastructure (DPI) “to get the next half a billion people to participate in the digital transaction.” According to him, achieving this would require the opening up of datasets and foundational models, thereby providing startups the opportunity to innovate.Verma went on to say that the onus to unleash AI-driven transformation in the global South region is on large companies. When asked about concerns about potential layoffs as companies achieve this efficiency through AI, he said large-scale upskilling will bring in productivity gains while repetitive jobs will “see a shift.”“Look at our per capita (income), 90 percent of India is at $1500-$2,000, right? Which is 800 million adults, so their current life is already at the bottom,” Verma said in a discussion with Google AI’s head Jeff Dean.Also Read: India well-positioned to help shape future of AI: Google DeepMind's Jeff DeanHe said India should not shy away from embracing the technology because of fear of job losses. Rather, the country needs to look at building and “shipping” such tools and reap benefits. “Resisting would be a bigger impediment for us,” Verma said.Verma has many feathers to his cap including being the co-creator of the open-source Beckn protocol, which is the base protocol for India’s Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and Namma Yatri."

Those who were more willing and able to take more risk would get it transferred from those who were bearing the risk but could not face it.With that thought let us dive deeper into the basic utility of Options that of managing risk associated with making some adventurous moves in special market conditions. While braveheart investors will still be making such moves without any help, I feel when you have such beautiful instruments why not use them?Let us look at a few such moves and see how Options can create safety nets.Move #1 Bargain Hunting (Possible Catching of falling knife).While there is a possibility that the stock would turn itself around immediately and recover back to a more reasonable level, equal chances are that there could be much more left to lose.Relief comes in terms of Buying a Call. Instead of Buying a stock at 100, buy a 100-strike Call. If the view is right, one would get all the benefits. But, in case things were to deteriorate further from there all that is at stake is the Call Premium. Essentially, a cost paid to get the pair of gloves. On a later date when expiry nears, the same can be converted to delivery as the chaos settles.Move #2 Buying into Expected Quick Recovery (Too Much Damage is done in a single day).Holders of a similar view as Case #1 but the class of participants here would be more tactical investors. The only difference here is the fall that shatters the stock in a single day and it seems too much.In such cases, the premiums are up across strikes (EG 110 Call of Rs100/- stock would be trading at 15 in volatile times instead of 5 in normal times). To fight this, pair up the Call Buy with a sell position in a few strikes higher call.While the Call sold would cap the profits, it would give that much-needed funding when the premiums have increased multifold.Move#3 Abrupt move for an Investor Holding stock for Long TermThis is more wealth preservation technique, instead of a wealth creation. I know the investors would not be tracking the stocks on a daily basis, but it wouldn’t hurt to have an alert mechanism in place. (not that difficult in this digital era). Just a simple drawing of attention would do when the stock starts behaving out of the ordinary on the lower side.In such a situation, when there is an above-average move, Buy a Put Option just till the price stabilizes and shows you signs of firm ordinary behaviour. Sort of like Buying Medical Insurance at the first sight of health irregularities. God forbid if anything unfortunate were to happen, the pockets would not be drained.So, gain all there is to gain if you win but using Options in adventurous moves do not lose if you lose.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) has provided clarity on disciplinary proceedings, applicability limit on number of assignments and fee structure with respect to an Insolvency Professional which is an Insolvency Professional Entity (IPE).An IPE can be a company, a limited liability partnership or a registered partnership firm. IBBI said that since an IPE acting as an IP would have multiple individuals as its partners or directors, a need is felt to clarify on the initiation of disciplinary proceedings in case of contraventions. In a circular issued on Thursday, the regulator said for contraventions, the show cause notice can be issued to the IPE’s partner or director who is an IP and was authorised to act on behalf of it for the respective assignment.Further, the circular said that if there are either repeated instances of contravention against one or more partners or directors, then the show cause notice can be served to the IPE. According to IBBI, the norms that provide for restrictions on the number of assignments that can be undertaken by an IP will not be applicable for IPEs. Regarding the fee structure, the regulator said that with the introduction of provisions allowing IPE to act as IP, it is considered prudent that IPEs have an expanded role, and their fee should be market-determined at this juncture.""Also, given their institutional framework, IPEs are better placed to negotiate their fees commensurate with their pool of in-house resources and diverse range of services offered by them as compared to an individual IP,"" it added. In another circular on Thursday, IBBI provided clarifications in relation to the rendering of professional service by an IP in the implementation of the resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority (AA) as well as on compliance regarding billing/ invoicing for services availed by IP from professionals.""… in order to facilitate smooth implementation of the resolution plan, it is hereby clarified that an IP may render professional service in relation to the implementation of the resolution plan approved by the AA, provided details of such service are mentioned in the resolution plan approved by the AA,"" it said. Besides, the circular said the bill or invoice may be raised in the name of the IPE or the professional or the firm in which such professional is a partner."

Numerous technical glitches have been reported by traders in recent months, coinciding with a substantial increase in trading volumes.In a detailed narrative, trader Jayraj Patil shared his experience with Zerodha, describing how a company representative attempted to negotiate a settlement. The initial offer was 20 percent, followed by subsequent increases to 30 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90 percent, and eventually a full refund without brokerage fees. However, Patil revealed that another representative withdrew the offer once he pursued legal redress and shared his ordeal on social media.This incident adds to the growing concern among investors regarding the reliability and accountability of brokerage platforms, especially when technical issues lead to financial losses.Also read: Trader vs broker: The 2010 case that helped Vijay Gupta win compensation from ZerodhaPatil shared a call recording with Moneycontrol in which an alleged Zerodha's employee can be heard placing a lot of emphasis on Patil's social media posts. The employee warns Patil that it is illegal to get someone else to write tweets for him and even names people he believes may have written the tweets for Patil.On February 1, nearly 40 days after he encountered the problem, Patil attended a conciliation meeting through the online dispute resolution (ODR) mechanism. The ODR has been set up by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) as an extension of its SCORES platform. At the meeting, Zerodha's representative said that the brokerage had withdrawn all refund offers.Why not customer care?Patil told Moneycontrol that he initially sought assistance from Zerodha's customer support but became frustrated with the process. After days of follow-ups and daily conversations with the customer service team, he accepted a 100 percent refund without brokerage. However, a few days later, another executive claimed there was a ""miscommunication"", and the earlier offer was no longer valid.Zerodha claims they were processing the refund, but upon the client's approach to the ODR mechanism, they decided to await the ODR's outcome before proceeding with the refund. When questioned about the conflicting statements from their employees, Zerodha attributed it to miscommunication and stated they are investigating the matter internally. The brokerage clarified that the withdrawal of the settlement offer was not due to the lack of authorisation but rather because of the complaint escalation to the exchange.Also read: Don’t backtrack, keep escalating: Trader on winning compensation claim against Zerodha"

Representations were made to the regulator that recent market reforms have made this requirement redundant, and that doing away with it will reduce cost for issuers and allow more people to raise capital from the market.Under Sebi (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) (ICDR) Regulations, an issuer is required to deposit with the designated stock exchange, an amount calculated at the rate of one per cent of the issue size available for subscription to the public in the manner specified by Board and/or stock exchange(s).This security deposit amount is refundable or forfeitable in the manner specified by the Board.The consultation paper said, ""The requirement of one percent security deposit was put in place for public/rights issues so that an issuer resolves investor complaints relating to the transaction such as for refund of application money, allotment of securities and dispatch of certificates"".It added, ""However, considering various reforms and present framework for public/rights issue such as application through Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA), UPI mode of payment, mandatory allotment in demat etc., the concerns relating to post-issue investor complaints regarding refund of application money, non-dispatch of physical certificates does not arise.""It also added that data showed that the average number of complaints per IPO have reduced after T+3 listing in IPOs. Even among these complaints, the majority were on delay in unblocking of ASBA funds by self-certified syndicate banks (SCSBs), for which SEBI vide circular dated March 16, 2021 has already prescribed a mechanism to deal with such complaints of delay in unblocking of application amounts under ASBA.The paper said, ""Therefore, since the requirement of one percent security deposit imposes cost on the part of issuers, the removal of the requirement will result in ease of doing business for issuers accessing the primary market."""

Edited excerpts:What are your first reactions to the Budget?I am delighted to see the fiscal consolidation. It's remarkable to see this sort of fiscal consolidation in an election year. Given that this is the year India is making its debut in the global bond markets, it'll bring down the ten-year bond yield, it will strengthen the rupee, and it will embellish India's credentials as a market. So I was expecting a 5.2 percent fiscal deficit target for FY25 but the FM has said 5.1 percent. The FM has pulled back the capex to 11 percent.The focus on energy transition was also interesting which had EV charging stations, rooftop solar, and EV buses at the state government level. After the elections, we will hear plenty more on EVs. The government has also been moving ahead with the affordable housing theme. It looks like they’re going to keep on re-emphasising the housing theme. We have invested plenty in the building materials and housing space. We've begun our investments in energy transition, so hopefully, by the time she spells out the details after the elections, we will have made more investments there.What do you think about the 5.1 percent fiscal deficit target?If she is able to deliver the Rs 45 trillion spending figure and keep it at or below that number then I think 5.1 percent is very doable.Did you see anything in the Budget that could trigger consumption?The Finance Minister was very clear that the government would not want to give entitlements to the poor. Over the four years, the National Democratic Alliance was very clear about not giving handouts and sops but rather giving direct benefit transfer where it is required. They want to drive consumption through job creation via EV charging stations. She seemed to suggest that there would be announcements which would make it easier for entrepreneurs to start EV charging stations. Also make financing easier through PSUs and quasi-governmental organisations. Nothing in the Budget suggested that there would be helicopter dropping of cash. The Budget seemed more about giving direct benefit transfer wherever it was necessary. And after that designing schemes for job creation.What are the direct plays from the Budget?The Finance Minister was talking about middle-class housing, which means there will be encouragement given to build and buy housing. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY) Grameen, 2 crore more dwellings are to be created over five years. So, the entire building material space with affordable housing financiers will become relevant. Over the last year, mainstream mortgage finance has grown 25 percent while affordable housing finance has only grown at 15 percent. This will reverse after the elections if the Finance Minister’s scheme has legs in it.I meet auto rickshaw drivers, vegetable store owners, barbers, and rickshaw pullers who are buying houses using PMAY. We have Aavas Financiers as our main investment. Affordable housing using PMAY will become a defining theme in the years ahead.In energy transition, we've invested in Eicher Motors because of Volvo. Volvo was steadily gaining market share and has also set up a new plant in Madhya Pradesh. A lot of auto ancillaries will become interesting because they will supply to Indian auto OEMs as well as global OEMs with EV parts. The more support the government gives to the energy transition now, the more benefits we get in the years ahead.The government is focusing on the women empowerment theme because there are more women voters now. The women theme will also become a big theme.Would you bet on any developers?Investing in real estate in India is tricky because of the lack of barriers to entry. Even in the middle of this crazy boom in real estate, developers are not making money. The reason they don’t make money in terms of cash flows is that there are dozens of developers in a location pursuing the same customer. The customer obviously benefits.What about solar? Does it look like a theme to you?The silicon rooftop solar will potentially become a very interesting theme. It's almost similar to building materials. We haven't spotted any of them in the stock market yet but I think if there's a big scheme around rooftop solar, given that much of the country is dredged in sunshine this looks like a potential theme. I’m sure private equity investors are looking at making rooftop solar investments which will get listed in the next two-three years.How does the market look this year?The situation in the Middle East is tricky. It is not something where Washington DC can call up a government and negotiate with them. These are basically wild people who are hijacking ships, and setting drones with missiles on them. So you are dealing with supranational terrorists who are blocking the most critical freight route in the world. I don’t have a clear answer. But if the Middle Eastern situation calms down, I'm sure bond deals and inflationary pressures will come off and equities rally further.The second thing to look out for is when the Federal Reserve will cut rates. If rate cuts come by the middle of the year then it makes it easy for the RBI to cut rates. Another thing to watch out for is whether India will fill the void created by China’s decline. In the July Budget there will be more tangible steps like PLI and FAME, which will allow India to step into the void created by China's decline. The fairy-tale situation for us would be if by Diwali the Middle-east has quietened, crude prices are at $70 per barrel, the Federal Reserve has started cutting, and China’s property issues continue. This combination is powerful for the stock markets.What do you expect in the next Budget that was missed this time?There will be announcements on taxes and disinvestments. In the five-year cycle, the NDA will try to push disinvestments. There will also be trade treaties with the UK and Switzerland.What are your top three themes for the next six months to a year?I would say the big transition. The FM had alluded to it in her speech also. Public sector capex has gone up around 30 to 35 percent in the last three Budgets. She is now saying that it is time the baton is passed on to the private sector. We at Marcellus are trying our best to identify private-sector capex plays. So far, we've made investments in Shanti Gears, RHI Magnesita and SKF. Second is the whole focus on Nari Shakti. There's a massive constituency that is aspirational, well educated, increasingly finding income and employment, and will be logical for the politicians to cater to that. So far, we have identified Trent and Rainbow Medicare. We're looking for more such plays. If you were to think about it, Nykaa, Mamaearth, etc, are women-focused businesses. I just wish they made a little bit more money and made it easier for us to invest. What's very interesting is that many of the needs of women are being intuited and catered to better by women entrepreneurs than by male entrepreneurs. And we're certainly looking forward to finding more such companies.The third theme is energy transition. The quicker we transition to EVs, the better. And if our EV ecosystem is efficient enough to become an exporter, then it also becomes a creator of jobs for the country. Eicher Motors has been our investment till now but there are plenty of other EV investments we need to research."

Category III funds are allowed to borrow or engage in leverage for investing, but subject to certain conditions.This new proposal is to give categories I and II more flexibility.ALSO READ: SEBI suggests nomination for jointly-held investments to be made optionalThe paper noted the government's active promotion of infrastructure development over the past few years, and Budget FY2023-24 highlighting the importance of private capital in funding infra investment.The regulator received various representations from the AIF industry on why they have not been able to participate often in infra projects.The industry has said that it is essential to allow AIFs to create encumbrance on their equity investments in infrastructure companies, to obtain project finance.This is because project finance is only given against pledge of equity of the project, that is, the equity of the special-purpose vehicle holding the project. This pledge provides lenders the right to step into the project in case the SPV defaults on its payment obligation. If such equity pledge isn't permitted, the ability of such projects to get lending is ""severely hampered"".The regulator noted that AIFs have been successful in channelising global institutional monies into infrastructure funds that have contributed to infrastructure development.The note added, ""Such AIFs typically own the equity of downstream project SPVs and hence such equity need to be pledged to project finance lenders. If pledging of equity by AIFs remains constrained, then AIFs would be at a significant disadvantage relative to all other equity participants (listed public companies, unlisted private companies, global pension funds, sovereign funds, global funds, etc.)""The paper also noted that global securities market regulators (such as the US SEC and UK FCA) and IOSCO have highlighted the risk of systemic financial sector leverage on the back of private capital investments."

Standalone revenue stood at Rs 944.5 crore, a 3.8 percent YoY growth.TCI's freight division saw segment operating profits contract by 45.4 percent to Rs 14.9 crore, due to disruptions in the red sea that caused a significant rise in container freight rates to Europe.The freight division accounts for approximately half of the company's net sales.

This figure also represents a significant rise of 148.3 percent from the rates seen on December 14 2023, reflecting an increase since the attacks on vessels started.The Indian government has warned that the recent surge in shipping costs due to the rerouting of commercial vehicles to avoid security risks in international waters has the potential to trigger inflation, especially in terms of energy costs.India's key trade body, the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) also reiterated concerns about cost pressures on Indian exporters due to intermittent attacks on consignments routed through the Red Sea""Freight rates have gone up unimaginably high, with the further burden of various surcharges, pushing Indian exporters to hold back around 25 percent of the outbound shipments transiting through the Red Sea, adding to the sense of scepticism and nervousness among the businesses and markets across the world,"" FIEO said in a note on January 15However, the company's supply chain solutions business continued to experience substantial growth, primarily driven by the recovery in demand from the automotive sector, which contributes about 80 percent to the division's revenue.The company's revenues from supply-chain solutions rose 16.4 percent on-year to Rs 388.2 crore, while profit from the segment was up 26.5 percent at Rs 25.3 crore.""The company has demonstrated a stable performance in the current quarter and nine months ended December 2023, given challenges in the macro environment.

He also feels conditions are right for private sector capex.","Prashant Jain, Founder, 3P Investments, believes that investors should be extra cautious  when it comes to industrial stocks as they are paying extremely high values for them. In an interview with Moneycontrol, he also said that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's announcement regarding free energy for households with solar rooftops will not trigger any meaningful investments in the space as it will become extremely crowded.Edited excerpts from the interview:Is private sector capex really ready for big-bang acceleration?Time will tell, but the conditions are very conducive. Corporate leverage is at a 10-15 year low, bank NPAs (non-performing assets) are minimal, corporate profitability is broad-based. Also, with the government’s focus on make in India and PLI (production-linked incentives), India is emerging as a viable manufacturing destination for global companies. The commentary on order backlogs and order flows of engineering companies is growing at a fairly decent pace. So, private capex is already happening.Also read: Private capex already picking up in India: Prashant Jain of 3P InvestmentsWhat is your outlook on industrials for this year?Markets have priced in a strong capital formation for a number of years across sectors. In many places, these stocks are expensive. Industrial stocks have good growth potential, but if growth becomes overvalued, like in consumer staple companies, one should not extrapolate continued business growth into stock market returns. In the last three years, returns in industrial stocks have been more than the business growth. So, a lot of the future performance has been priced in.Thus, investors should be extra cautious and tone down expectations in industrial stocks. If you are paying 40-60 times the earnings multiple, you have to be very sure of sustained high levels of growth. The risk-reward ratio in industrial stocks from here on is not good.Also read: Industrial stocks pricing in high growth may disappoint; power utilities good investment options: Prashant JainWhat about green energy?The world is very focussed on green energy, so this sector will grow. Electric vehicles (EVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) will consume a lot of energy over time. Hence, India's power demand growth should be quite healthy. India is focused on increasing its share of renewable energy (RE), but we should not lose sight of the fact that EVs are not yet profitable.Solar rooftop companies are upbeat after the Finance Minister’s announcement. Is there something for investors in rooftop solar companies?I don't think rooftop solar power will make much of a difference to  utility firms. Their  share of residential consumption is not huge. And utilities are a controlled return on capital business. On the supply chain side there could be some opportunities, but the scale at which the government is planning the rooftop solar thing, this field will be extremely crowded. I doubt if any meaningful investment opportunities will arise.What about NBFCs?There could be some more re-rating left for NBFCs (non-banking financial companies). So the opportunity for growth in this space is large. The return on capital is very attractive, and capital formation will grow faster than GDP.What about PSUs banks? Is there some juice left?The credit-deposit (CD) ratios of these banks are low, and in a deposit-constrained environment, they have a competitive advantage. Also, banks in India have underperformed, so the outlook on banks in general is good.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The government is not against the idea of holding a minority stake (less than 50 percent) in key strategic public sector companies, she said in an exclusive interview with Network18.“Absolutely,” Sitharaman told Network18 Editor-in-Chief Rahul Joshi, when asked if she was okay with holding 49 percent or less in PSUs including SBI and ONGC. Currently the government holds a controlling 57.49 percent stake in SBI and 58.89 percent stake in ONGC.“You will see periodically, DIPAM, the department which takes care of the disinvestment has slowly released a lot of government's shares into the market so that private ownerships can come in and they can take hold of those shares,” said Sitharaman.The government has been on a divestment drive in recent years, selling stake in numerous publicly listed and privately held companies. However, it has sold the controlling stake in only Air India in recent years, which was acquired by Tata Group.Steps for raising the valuations of PSUsThe finance minister also highlighted that the government was all in for those steps that raise the valuation of PSUs. Government owned companies have historically traded at discounts to their private peers. However, in the last couple of years, they have closed the gap.“We are working to make sure that…the valuations are kept up,” she said. “If you look at the public sector listed companies and their valuation in the market today, you see the kind of vibrancy which has been brought into them. The share prices have gone up, the dividends are much better than earlier. So, disinvestment is one thing but (we are working on) bringing value to them, and making sure that the market looks at them favourably.”Sitharaman also highlighted that the private sector has been allowed into those “core strategic” sectors and the government wants to have only “minimum presence” in these sectors."

Kela also spoke about the interim Budget and themes and sectors where he finds opportunities. Edited excerpts:Madhu Kela’s top three bets: PSU banks, pharma, tourism stocksWhat are your first views on the Budget?It was an event which in a way was a little special because we were in an election year and it was expected that they would be far more populistic than they have been, but their intent to curtail the fiscal deficit this year and also give a two-year guidance of 4.5 percent is actually very heartening. This will lead to a reasonable amount of borrowing and liquidity for banks and private sector companies to look for their requirement of capital. The other thing is the continuation of all the good work which has happened in the last 10 years. Fourth is the stability of taxes, which is very important. In the last two years, they have not made any big changes. Even if they have made changes they have all been positive.Is there any juice left in banks now with the yield curve falling about 10 basis points? Will you still prefer only the PSU banks or banks in general?In my 30 years in the market, if you look at the last three years’ performance of the overall Bank Nifty and a lot of private sector banks, PSU banks by margin have overperformed significantly compared with their private sector peers. I am a big believer in markets and trends. When I look at public sector banks, are they overvalued today? A lot of public sector companies are trading at 30-50 PE multiples. Public sector banks are still below 5 PE. If I take a two-year forward view, either that portion of the market is significantly overvalued and that has to correct significantly or they have to correct to come to some median level. I'm not trying to compare a different company with a public sector bank in terms of PE multiple but still, there has to be some resemblance. All the worries related to PSBs on governance, technology and credit costs have diminished as they have become as good as any other private banks. So in terms of valuation, I still think there is some value for them.Govt’s Rs 50,000 cr divestment plan to not have any impact on PSUs: Madhusudan KelaDo you see value in any of the other PSUs apart from banks?We find value in some oil companies. I obviously feel in the short term there is a little bit of valuation discomfort in railway and even in select defence stocks. But I think there is still value in some pockets in the PSU segment... and if they truly come and divest even two or three companies in the next 12 months, then obviously, we will all change our opinion, including me, and we'll start looking at PSU companies from a different lens.Which other companies do you find value in?We are still looking at a lot of infrastructure companies, specifically in the EPC space. We are positive in select financial stocks. We are also looking at private banks which are very attractive in value. We are looking at pharma companies. If you look at the pharma companies' results in the last two-three quarters, all large-cap pharma companies have made their life high, and it is one sector which has kind of underperformed. On a bottom-up basis there are still a lot of opportunities in this market.What about IT?Selectively, yes. We have invested in two or three mid-sized IT companies. And surprisingly, it has done far better than what I would have expected.What are the other points that stood out in the FM’s speech?The one point which I picked up was inclusive growth. If you look at her opening statement on what has been achieved in the last 10 years, it makes you really bullish on India. One statement that I would pick up from her speech is that there is tremendous potential for the tourism sector. And they are also starting to talk about religious tourism now. I think there might be some hidden jewel out there on the tourism side, whether it is on the services or the asset side.You have always been bullish about the pharma sector. As an overall opportunity, it continues to be a very small portion of the index. Do you see that expanding?It is already happening compared to where we were 10 years ago. In 2009, the value of the entire pharma sector was half the valuation of DLF, which was Rs 2 lakh crore. That (pharma sector valuation) is now more than Rs 10 lakh crore market cap. In a way it has done well in the medium to long term and I remain very positive on the sector given what is happening geopolitically – our ability during the COVID time to produce a vaccine for such a big disease in 12 to 18 months. So I think there will be pockets of opportunity including domestic.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

What now?,"February 02, 2024 05:52 PM IST","FM’s reiteration of commitment to focus areas such as rooftop solars, affordable housing, green energy, EV transition, metros, railways did not cause an upswing in these stocks only meant that capex spending has already been priced in.","The Finance Minister walked away with kudos for not taking the populist route despite this being an election year and, perhaps more impressively, for prioritising fiscal consolidation with realistic assumption. A nominal GDP growth of 10.5 percent for FY25, with a 5.1 percent fiscal deficit, a net borrowings of Rs 11.73 crore with a modest 11 percent increase in capex spend sounds prudent and achievable.On the face of it, stock markets did not seem to cheer the move with the Nifty ending the session with a mild loss, but the fact that the market held up in the face a 2 percent fall in US markets on January 31 after negative cues from the Federal Reserve and weak Asian markets was proof that investors were not too disappointed after all.Equally, that FM’s reiteration of commitment to focus areas such as rooftop solars, affordable housing, green energy, EV transition, metros, railways did not cause an upswing in these stocks only meant that capex spending has already been priced in. Consumption stocks were not delivered any big surprises either. In fact, the other way round. Baring rural housing, the budget did not have any triggered to lift rural demand. The only exceptional gainers were the public sector bank stocks, which along with other banking stocks, were on a tear thanks to fall in yields after the pleasant surprise on the lower than expected net market borrowing number.Falling yields or stronger bond prices will result in mark-to-market gains on banks’ bond portfolios, which will flow directly into their bottomline.Overall, markets are clearly running out of triggers, and valuations continue to be elevated across most segments of the market, both industrials and consumption. Both government capex spend and pace of execution are expected to slow down ahead of elections, which would result in industrial stocks moving sideways for a bit. Consumption stocks, in pockets, have been correcting steadily because of high valuations, although certain segments catering to premiumisation have been doing well. Overall though the momentum in the market continues to be strong because of the avalanche of fund flows from local investors. The steady flow through Systematic Investment Plans, and greater commitments from high net worth individuals and family-offices is triggering more and more demand for stocks, pushing prices higher.The general sentiment among investors seems to be that equities will only go one way, that is up. Thus, all falls are being bought into. And elevated valuations have generally compelled investors to keep moving from one pocket to another, keeping sector rotation at play. Even so, investors fancy for smids has caused valuations to go through the roof as the lure of quick returns draws in more and more investors into poor quality stocks. This is unlikely to change unless there is an accident that causes a sharp fall and dents investor sentiment, scaring them away like it did in the previous bull runs.In the world of stock markets, whatever is unsustainable usually finds a way not to sustain itself. It’s hard to say how and when. But valuations, if one looks at large-caps, even the entire Nifty 500 pack, which constitutes 91 percent of the total market-cap of all listed companies is hardly screaming caution. One-year forward P/E for Nifty 500 stands at 21.75, nearly the same the 10-year average. Nifty Small-cap 100, which constitutes 5 percent of all listed companies trades at 22.03x compared with 17.77x. Specific stocks command much higher multiples. In that sense, there is exuberance, but that is only a small segment of the market. The rest of the market is neither a screaming buy nor a screaming sell. It’s a market that can deliver returns in line with the economy’s growth plus a couple of percentage points as corporate profits can be better than topline growth because of scale, productivity and efficiency benefits.Going by segments, currently, large-caps offer a lot more value than smids, which command a significant valuation premium. This mismatch will be bridged eventually, but once again it is hard to predict when. For this to happen, one, enough money needs to flow into these stocks and that will happen only when foreign investors come in because large stocks are their natural hunting ground because of size. Another way for this to happen would be through any regulatory intervention that diverts the avalanche of funds flowing into small-cap fund schemes into large-cap fund schemes. For investors who are willing to stay invested for the medium-term, where to hunt for relative value is a no-brainer.Having said that, making outsized returns from hereon will require investors to take sharply contrarian calls, and take a leap of faith on an entrepreneur, business or an institution. There was a time not long ago when power financials like PFC and REC were trading at yields higher than 15-20%, as if they were about to go bankrupt. Today, investors can’t get enough of these stocks. On the other hand, HDFC Bank, the darling of stock market for 30 years is trading at its lowest valuation in more than 20 years, and there are hardly any takers. Where there is pain, there is money to be made. That’s one way to think, not the only way though.Over the next few months, till general elections, markets will be driven by stock-specific factors as well as an eclectic bunch of concerns, from geo-political news, political noise and commentary on US inflation to interest rates, dollar index, crude oil and news on China and so on.Meanwhile, the hunt for value will continue and market will become even more unforgiving towards companies who fail to meet expectations, as was made painfully evident with the sharp stock reactions in companies that faltered on quarterly results.Correction if any will only be welcome, soothe some nerves and extend the bull run."

Regarding the impact of Paytm stock on his fund, Arora said their “NAV was ok on the previous day, considering one stock was down 20 percent because we have 35-40 names, and one name doesn’t spoil my sleep”.Paytm’s shares fell more than 40 percent in the past two trading sessions.

The projected numbers for fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent, I'm not so sure if they can manage that. It looks a bit aggressive, but we'll see how the year pans out,"" he added, in a post budget conversation with Moneycontrol.Sharma spoke about why he continues to find opportunities in smallcaps. Edited excerpts:What is your first reaction to the budget?As it was just a vote on account there was nothing much that we could have expected in terms of a “big bang” - they have just kept the same sound bites and terms, which markets love. There is one thing that I like about this government is that it's a very stock market-driven government. It knows exactly the language and the lingo that the market likes, and it uses it liberally during all such budget or policy announcements. To that end, it seems pretty much like a continuity of what the policies have been. On the projected numbers for fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent, I'm not so sure if they can manage that. It looks a bit aggressive, but we'll see how the year pans out. Otherwise, it's just a very straightforward, simplified exercise being a vote on account.The market has not reacted very positively, it seems to have taken the announcements as more of the same. Does this mean that everything had already been factored into the stock prices?Exactly! I think upsides of the capex spend were factored in. I do not think the market had factored in any slippages on the capex front because the fiscal deficit number seems quite aggressive in terms of the reduction. An 0.8 or 0.7 percent reduction seems a big deal and the reduction will necessarily have to come from two counts--better revenues or lower capex or a bit of both. The reality will obviously pan out over the course of the next twelve or 13 months. If the numbers on the revenue front do not come through, then to meet the fiscal deficit, capex will have to be cut back. That I think is what is going to weigh on the mind of the market.Also read: Budget Verdict | Fiscal deficit at 5.1% aggressive target: Shankar Sharma explains why India remains a smallcap marketWhat will be the triggers that we can focus on from here on, for stock prices to go up?  I think India's growth remains a smallcap market. I mean, that's really what I am really focused on, because nothing in the budget tells me that the largecaps are going to do well. Capex is necessarily going to be reduced to meet fiscal deficit. And if the glide path to the fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent in 2026 is to be met, the growth on capex cannot remain at this kind of breakneck speed. This means that if the capex numbers will be dialled back in your next budget, the effect on largecaps is going to be dramatic. On smallcaps, not so much. I continue to believe India remains a fantastic smallcap market and an average largecap market.Also read: Top gainers and losers of the day: What the Budget changed for themMost fund managers are betting that, with this global trade setup, FII money will come in and that this fund flow will start to support largecaps.Fund managers obviously make most of their money from larger AUMs, and larger AUMs necessarily must be in the larger companies. On a personal investing front, it's a fantastic time to be in smallcaps, as it has been over the last couple of years. I see nothing changing.What kind of smallcaps and midcaps are you looking at? A lot of the stocks that have really run up are to do with some kind of government intervention…I'm not at all interested in anything to do with the government, even though I look very dated in thinking that, given the run-up…Also read: What Shankar Sharma, Madhu Kela, Sandeep Tandon & Prashant Jain are betting on as markets hit new highBut the kind of stocks you look at, in the private sector, small and midcap space definitely look very expensive...I've always believed that valuation is an overrated tool in investing… A lot of the companies I invest in or am planning to invest in, the numbers have been eye popping for the last twelve months. What looked expensive turned out to be not-so-expensive because these are companies with profit numbers of maybe Rs 2500 crore where the needle can move very quickly. So, my companies are younger, they can move much faster. They can take away market share from the larger companies. They can have niches which are fairly protected and they don't fortunately rely on government intervention. So, I'm quite happy in my neck of woods.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Here are seven stocks that still offer solid upside potential of over 30 percent, with reasonable valuations, and robust growth outlook.Adani Enterprises | CMP: Rs 3,153Cantor Fitzgerald has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,369The flagship firm of the Adani Group has started to regain investor confidence after the apex court cleared the air for the company. Experts suggest that risk-reward is in favour of the investors at current levels and the company is the most reliable for bringing energy resources into India (- this needs to be attributed). Its current valuation is largely driven by three main segments namely airports, roads, and its new energy ecosystem. Adani Enterprises shares have jumped over 43 percent in the past three months.HDFC Bank | CMP: Rs 1,466CLSA has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,025Notwithstanding near-term concerns over strain on the lender's net interest margin and sluggish deposits post its mega-merger, HDFC Bank's sharp slump in January has turned its valuations attractive. Analysts say that concerns over deposits and NIMs are an overall industry snag, and not specific to HDFC Bank. Moreover, analysts see the lender as a long-term growth story, with the potential to sail through the near-term headwinds as its merger settles down. HDFC Bank has delivered marginally negative returns in the past three months.PVR Inox | CMP: Rs 1,434HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,140After a rather dull 2022 for Bollywood, the multiplex company is gradually getting back on its feet. Analysts see light at the end of the tunnel and believe that the content pipeline in CY25 will improve. Global brokerage firm HSBC said that the business fundamentals have stabilised and most concerns are transient. Elara Securities said the company's concerns were overdone, adding that PVR-Inox has a healthy outlook in the medium term. PVR Inox has fallen nearly 10 percent in the past three months.SBI Life Insurance | CMP: Rs 1,432BNP Paribas has an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 2,450The life insurer is one of the best bets out there in the insurance space. The company anticipates clocking in robust, industry-beating growth in the medium term, with solid VNB margins, that are likely to stick around 28 percent for FY24. Brokerages are also buying into the management's bullishness as they expect SBI Life to show margin resilience. The cherry on the cake is the stock's underperformance in the past three months, leaving room for a stronger comeback. The stock has gained 7 percent in the past three months, underperforming the benchmark Nifty's 15 percent gains.Cyient | CMP: Rs 1,939Morgan Stanley has an overweight call with a target price of Rs 2,700Analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest a robust fourth quarter amid demand visibility in key verticals such as connectivity and aerospace. In the previous quarters, communications bottoming out was a positive for the analysts, who are of the view that the strong performance from different verticals has made the outlook promising. Cyient shares have surged 17 percent in the past three months.Asian Paints | CMP: Rs 2,929HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,020After a stellar October-December quarter, analysts see the growth outlook as strong, and expect price wars to stabilise in the coming quarters. HSBC believes that fears of competition-based prices are exaggerated. As for the rural demand, the monsoon coupled with an uptick in government spending and moderating inflation is likely to bring in positivity for the rural economy. Asian Paints has lost 0.4 percent in the past three months.Sunteck Realty | CMP: Rs 470YES Securities has a buy call with a target price of Rs 586In recent years, Sunteck Realty has showcased an impressive track record of acquiring projects and ramped up its execution capabilities. A strong balance sheet, strong upcoming cash flow and a consolidating market make management optimistic about doubling its under-execution pipeline to Rs 600 bn in 3 years, making the stock a favourite among analysts. Meanwhile, current valuations also make the risk-reward favourable for Sunteck Realty, with new project additions being the key growth drivers. Shares of Sunteck Realty are up 7 percent in the past three months.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Markets still see a chance of a March move at about 40%, while the probability for a May move stood at 32 basis points - implying a 100% probability of 25 basis points and some chance of a 50 basis-point easing.Reflecting the still sizeable cuts to come this year - about 145 basis points priced in - and renewed jitters over regional U.S. banks adding to safe-haven demand, longer-term Treasuries are headed for the best week since mid December.Ten-year treasury yields rose 2 basis points to 3.887%, but were still down a whopping 27 basis points for the week. The rate sensitive two-years were also up 2 bps at 4.2186%, but down 15 bps on the week.The slide in yields pressured the U.S. dollar, which fell 0.5% overnight against its peers and on Friday stuck to the low end of its recent range at 103.03.The euro was buoyant at $1.0877, having lifted 0.5% overnight after data showed underlying price pressures in the euro zone were still strong. The sterling perched at $1.2745, having rallied 0.5% overnight after the Bank of England said it would tread carefully about rate cuts.In energy markets, oil prices recouped some losses from the previous day following a decision by OPEC+ to keep its oil output policy unchanged, though they are still headed for weekly losses.

However, layoffs in the sector have recently caused optimism to cool down.","Three of the biggest tech companies reported their quarterly earnings on February 1. Meta announced its first-ever dividend, while Amazon posted strong earnings. However, Apple reported a sales slowdown in its key China market. These three tech companies are part of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" and have been driving a market resurgence. However, layoffs in the sector have recently caused optimism to cool down.Coming to the results, Apple announced its first revenue gain in over a year, though the company continues to grapple with a decline in global smartphone demand.The California-based company posted $119.58 billion in revenue and $2.18 in earnings per share (EPS), beating Wall Street expectations of $117.91 billion in full-year revenue and $2.10 in EPS. This 2 percent growth in sales is a positive sign for the tech giant, as it breaks the company's four-quarter streak of declining revenue. However, the company's shares dropped in after-hours trading.Despite the revenue growth, Apple's sales in China, its third-largest market, dropped from $23.9 billion to $20.8 billion. The company also saw a decline in global iPad sales, which dropped to $7 billion in the most recent quarter, from $9 billion in the same quarter last year.On a more positive note, Apple's iPhone sales increased to $69.7 billion in the three months ending in December 2023, up from $65.8 billion year-over-year. However, this news was dampened by the recent prediction by prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who forecasted that Apple's iPhone shipments would decrease by 15 percent year-over-year, due in part to a sizable drop in iPhone sales in China.Despite the challenges, Apple's services business maintained its growth, with the company posting $23.1 billion in revenue, up from $20.8 billion in services revenue the previous year. However, Microsoft overtook Apple as the world's most valuable company in January, hitting a $3 trillion valuation while Apple's market capitalisation slipped.Meta exceeded expectations with its fourth-quarter earnings report released on Thursday, revealing an impressive 25 percent increase in revenue from $32.2 billion to $40.3 billion. This marks the fastest rate of growth in any period since mid-2021 and is largely attributed to the rebounding online ad market, according to a CNBC report. Additionally, the company's cost-cutting measures led to an 8 percent decrease in expenses year over year, and an operating margin that more than doubled to 41 percent, indicating increased profitability.Compared to the previous year, Meta's net income increased more than threefold, from $4.65 billion to $14 billion, with earnings per share growing from $1.76 to $5.33.In a first for the company, Meta announced its intention to pay investors a dividend of 50 cents per share on March 26th. Meta also declared a $50 billion share buyback.Meanwhile, Amazon too, reported impressive fourth-quarter results on Thursday, surpassing analysts' expectations. The company's net income surged to $10.6 billion compared to $278 million in the same period last year.Furthermore, Amazon's first-quarter sales are expected to grow between 8 percent and 13 percent, reaching between $138 billion and $143.5 billion. This is higher than analysts' estimates of $142.1 billion, CNBC states. Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing division, saw sales climb 13 percent in the fourth quarter to $24.2 billion, in line with Wall Street's forecast. However, it was a deceleration from the year-ago period when sales grew 20 percent.On the other hand, Amazon's advertising unit saw impressive growth, with sales increasing by 27 percent year over year to $14.7 billion. The company has started showing ads on Prime Video content, which analysts predict will generate significant new revenue for the business.Wall Street Reaction Meta Platforms and Amazon.com saw a combined increase of $280 billion in their stock market value on Thursday after reporting their quarterly results. Apple's market value decreased by $70 billion following its results.Amazon's stock rose by 8 percent as the company exceeded expectations for December-quarter revenue growth due to strong online spending during the holiday shopping season.

Edited excerpts:How will you rate the Budget on 1-10 scale?The key themes of the Interim Budget 2024 are fiscal consolidation and continued capex led growth. The focus continues to be on infrastructure, renewable energy, housing, agriculture and defence. The direction is towards a manageable growth outlay within a prudent fiscal management framework.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the Interim Budget as 9/10 .Do you expect the budget deficit gap of 5.1 percent for FY25 to be achievable?The budget deficit target for FY24 was initially budgeted at 5.9 percent of GDP from 6.4 percent in FY23 but the revised estimate of 5.8 percent indicates that the government is expected to overachieve this number. This year’s budget revenue assumptions seem realistic and achievable and we see no reason to doubt the government’s ability to meet the 5.1 percent of GDP fiscal deficit aim for FY25.Are you increasing exposure to PSU stocks after the budget?As can be seen from our previous fact sheets, we have had an exposure across schemes to PSU banks based upon their improvement in fundamental performance in the past few years and relatively attractive valuations.We continue to remain positive on their prospects, and depending upon the valuations or opportunities, and based upon the mandate of a particular scheme may take decision of resizing our holdings in them.Do you think the infrastructure stocks rally will sustain, given the increase in capex outlay by 11 percent for FY25?We see the capex story as a five-seven years' opportunity and we are in the early leg of this cycle. Continued government capex growth, on a high base is a positive. Going ahead, as capacity utilisation in the private sector cross optimal utilisation levels and driven by initiatives like PLI (production linked incentive), we may see an increase in private sector capex programmes, which can complement the government capex schemes and contribute in overall capex continuing. This can potentially provide further triggers for infrastructure stocks.What is your take on the railway and electric vehicle stocks after the budget?Allocation for the auto PLI has increased from Rs 500 crore in FY24RE (revised estimates) to Rs 3,500 crore in FY25BE (budget estimate), and the battery PLI from Rs 10 crore in FY24RE to Rs 250 crore in FY25BE. This indicates the government is expecting disbursements to start in FY25. The actual disbursements of PLI incentives would still be subject to meeting investment and production milestones by the companies as well as final approvals.The budget has raised the allocation for PM electric bus scheme from just Rs 20 crore in FY24RE to Rs 1,300 crore in FY25BE. The Finance Minister, in the budget speech, also emphasised greater adoption of e-buses for public transport networks through payment security mechanism. So while there could be short-term hiccups, the long-term electrification story remains intact.Conversion of 40,000 railway bogies to Vande Bharat Standards is a positive for companies with railways exposure.Also read: A confident interim budget from a government in full commandDo you really expect more in the full budget in July, as FM says there will be detailed roadmap for Viksit Bharat?Yes, as this was a vote-of-account budget, newer proposals were not expected, although that is likely to change in the full budget due in July.Do you expect any risk to the market from geopolitical tensions. FM said in her Budget speech that geopolitical affairs are becoming more complex and challenging.India's neutral geopolitical position has played to the country's advantage when it comes to attracting global investment, as more and more countries direct trade towards friendly nations.From a geopolitical perspective, it would be a beneficiary of more FDI flows. India remains an attractive investment destination, in particular, due to rising geopolitical tensions. The US remains the main trading partner as well as one of the main sources of FDI.From a macro perspective, speaking in terms of emerging markets in general and assuming that our baseline scenario is correct and materialises, probably the sweet spot for emerging markets would be around the second quarter of next year. Any geopolitical risks may have short term impact and will not hamper the overall India story.What is your reading of the FOMC policy meeting and chairman Jerome Powell's speech? Do you expect a further delay in rate cuts?In the post policy press conference, governor Powel seems to have all but ruled out a cut at the next FOMC meeting in March. More than the timing of the rate cut, markets need to be cognizant that while the Fed is expected to begin dialling back policy restraint at some point this year, the focus perhaps needs to be on the pace of easing and the eventual terminal rate in this cycle.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Factoring in the gains of Indian stocks on the yen basis last month, the figures suggest inflows of about ¥140 billion into India equity funds, while Japanese stock funds had almost no net inflows.The investment into Indian equities extended the country’s lead over its peers as Japan’s favorite emerging stock market, partly thanks to tax-free investment accounts that started this year. Holdings of India’s stocks rose more than those of any other developing economy last year, according to Bloomberg analysis of government data that factor in net purchases and asset prices.“Indian stocks are attracting interest as a theme for economic growth, as the next China,” said Daiju Aoki, regional chief investment officer at UBS SuMi Trust Wealth Management Co. in Tokyo. “Client interest is more about India as a whole rather than individual companies.”In contrast, flows into Chinese shares dropped the most among 14 emerging markets that are covered by Japan’s data on international investment positions. The figures include positions of institutional and retail investors.The shift in money from Japan, the world’s biggest creditor, comes as China grapples with the collapse of a property bubble and deflation — the economic malaise that Japan suffered for decades.India’s Nifty 50 Index was almost flat in local currency terms last month but was up 4.2% in yen, due to the Japanese currency’s decline. The Shanghai Composite Index and the Hang Seng Index fell 3.5% and 5.7% respectively for yen-based investors.Economists forecast India’s year-on-year economic growth will average more than 6% at least until the second quarter of 2025, while China’s is expected to remain below 5% during this period.

Gensol Engineering Ltd. has rallied more than 3,200 percent, Zodiac Energy Ltd. 1,000 percent and Waaree Renewable Technologies Ltd. 1,800 percent in that same period.“People are following the hype cycle rather than fundamentals,” said Rajeev Thakkar, chief investment officer at PPFAS Asset Management Pvt. Ltd., said via phone. “We are only watching the space and have not invested” in the stocks, he said, citing poor return ratios for some companies in the sector.The skyrocketing share prices of these small stocks are now facing a reality check, as surging production capacity weighed on prices and earnings are struggling to keep up with the pace of gains. This is reminiscent of a US boom, which drove up valuations before a collapse sent the GS US Renewables basket of companies benefiting from renewable-energy transition down 43 percent from a high in February 2021.Solar module prices fell to record lows this month, forcing leading Chinese equipment maker TCL Zhonghuan Renewable Energy Technology Co. last week to issue a profit warning.“Plummeting prices across the solar supply chain in China and Southeast Asia will frustrate onshoring ambitions in Europe, India and the US,” Lara Hayim and Jenny Chase of BloombergNEF wrote in a note. Installations are rising, but some manufacturers will sell at a loss this year, they said.‘Crazy’ valuationsThe biggest stock winners in India’s renewable sector are now all facing the challenge from minuscule earnings, which has sent valuations through the roof.SG Mart, for example, reported net sales of 15.6 million rupees ($190,000) and net income of 2 million rupees in the latest full fiscal year, but commands a market value of $720 million, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The founders of SG Mart have sold some of their holdings in the company to retail and rich investors amid the rally. Similar patterns can be seen in Gensol and Waaree Renewable.Waaree Renewable and SG Mart now command price-to-book values 99 times previous 12-month earnings and 87 times, respectively — much higher than the Nifty 50 index’s three times.Moms and pops are the ones diving in. Over the past 12 months, retail investors — defined as those with investments of up to 200,000 rupees — raised their holdings in most of the top gainers including Waaree Renewable, Gensol, Taylormade Renewable and Zodiac Energy, according to latest filings.“I don’t think investors are doing the right thing by chasing narratives,” Amit Doshi, portfolio manager at Care Portfolio Managers Pvt., said. “Making exceptional returns becomes difficult if you pay over the odds” to own companies, he said. Institutional investors like Doshi have largely stayed away from some of the big winners in the sector, citing untenable valuations and low free floats.To be sure, as the government invests billions through state-owned enterprises, and provides incentives for various renewable equipment manufacturing and supports adoption of electric vehicles, the industry has plenty of growth potential. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also announced funding plans Thursday to support the use of renewable energy. But the risks for these small stocks may be too high to ignore.Aniket Shah, New York-based head of global ESG for Jefferies Group LLC, said that slow growth in new capacity addition and lack of support from western economies on financing and technology transfer are things that are keeping him “up at night.” Investors are taking big technology and customer demand risks and they’re “going to need to get compensated for that,” he said."

What's your post-budget blueprint?","February 02, 2024 07:53 AM IST","Over near term, Ashish Kyal expects rangebound movement between 21,840 – 21,420 for the Nifty 50. Break of this range can provide trading opportunity in that direction.","The Nifty 50 had a volatile trade on the budget day, but faced resistance at 21,850 before ending the session with moderate gains on February 1. The index also negated lower highs, lower lows formation this week and almost made higher highs, higher lows formation on the daily charts, though there was a bearish candlestick pattern formation. The index was down 28 points to 21,698.Even the volatility dropped sharply after the passing of two key events namely, the budget and the FOMC meet. The India VIX, which measures the expected volatility for next 3o days in the Nifty 50, fell nearly 10 percent to 14.46 from 16 mark, which may give support to the bulls in the coming days.Thus, in the coming sessions, if the Nifty 50 manages to surpass the 21,850 area and sustain above the same, then there could be a possibility of index filling the downside gap created on January 17. If it comes true, then the rally beyond 22,000 can't be ruled out, while 21,500 is the key to watch on the support front, experts said.The index held 10-day and 21-day EMA in the past couple of sessions, and with this, it traded above all key moving averages, which is a positive sign.""The Nifty on the Budget day did not result into any major directional move on either side. The index has an important resistance near 21,840 levels which it is failing to break after many attempts and short term support is now near 21,620 levels,"" Ashish Kyal, CMT, founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, said.Trading strategy for Nifty 50Over near term, Kyal expects rangebound movement between 21,840 and 21,420 for the Nifty 50. A break in this range can provide trading opportunity in that direction.According to Ashwin Ramani, derivative analyst at Samco Securities, the level of 21,800 on the upside and the level of 21,500 on the downside will be the two key levels for the Nifty.The implied volatility percentile (IVP) of the Nifty is 88 percent. The implied volatility (IV) of the Nifty is 14. The IVP of 88 percent indicates that 88 percent of the times in the last one year, the IV of Nifty traded below 14 and only 12 percent of the times in the last one year the IV of Nifty traded above 14.""We can interpret that the current IV of Nifty, which is 14, is at the higher range of the historical volatility. It has been seen in the past that volatility rises before the budget and cools off post the budget announcement. Since the IV of Nifty is at the higher range of historical volatility, chances are that volatility can cool off in the coming days,"" Ramani said.In this backdrop and in order to take advantage of the current market situation, one can deploy an Iron Butterfly strategy in Nifty.While explaining strategy, he advised buying one lot of 22,400 Call option around 11 and buying one lot of 21,000 Put option around 18 and hedging the same by selling 1 lot of 21,700 Call option around 165 and selling 1 lot of 21,700 Put option around 172, with weekly expiry of February 8.He feels the maximum profit in the strategy is capped at Rs 15,271 while the maximum loss is capped at Rs 19,612.The strategy has a probability of profit (POP) of 63 percent and the breakeven for this strategy is 21,392-22,008. Meaning, ""the strategy will result in profit as long as Nifty trades inside the breakeven range while the strategy will start losing money if the index breaks out sharply on either side of the range,"" he explained.He says the capital required to deploy the Iron Butterfly strategy in Nifty is 70,000. ""It is advisable to exit the strategy if Nifty moves out the 21,392-22,008 breakeven range.""Bank NiftyThe Bank Nifty had a good day despite volatility in the market and closed above 46,000 mark, thanks to the rally in PSU banks post budget. The index has formed Doji kind of candlestick pattern on the daily charts, and climbed 192 points to 46,189.Ashish Kyal said the Bank Nifty has major hurdle near 46,600 levels and support at 45,650 near the low created on budget day. Bank Nifty is underperforming Nifty as of now.He feels the breach above 46,600 is must for a positive trend in the index for move to 47,200 with support of 45,650 levels. Hourly close below 45,650 level will take prices to 45,200 levels.Trading strategy for the day can be creating long positions in Bank Nifty futures above 46,700 for a move to 47,200, he said.After the rally led by PSU banks on budget day, Om Mehra, technical analyst at SAMCO Securities feels, iIn the coming session, there is an expectation that private banking stocks could outperform.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

On the daily charts, the index is in a consolidation range between 21,350 and 21,850 levels, signaling a short-term sideways sentiment.Critical technical indicators, especially the relative strength index (RSI), continued to show positive momentum, maintaining levels above 60 on weekly and monthly intervals.

The MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has provided a bullish crossover in the positive territory, underscoring the trend's strength backed by substantial momentum.A noteworthy observation is the ratio chart of IOB against Nifty, which indicates a change of polarity.

With the ADX at 36, a well-established trend is indicated, and the +DI consistently remaining above 25 underscores the strength of the positive momentum.Looking ahead, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting Rs 1,048 level.

Public sector capex, he explains, has gone up steadily during the last three budgets but now the Finance Minister has spoken about passing on the baton to the private sector. “We at Marcellus are trying our best to identify private sector capex plays,” he explained.Also read: Delighted about fiscal consolidation; hope for more EV announcements post-polls: Saurabh MukherjeaThe next theme is women empowerment or “Nari Shakti”.  According to Mukherjea, there is a massive constituency that is aspirational, well educated, increasingly finding income and employment. “We are looking for more plays that cater to them. In a way, if I think about it, Nykaa, Mama Earth etc., are women-focused plays. I just wish they made a little bit more money, make it easier for us to invest. We're certainly looking forward to finding more such companies,” he said.Mukherjea quoted RBI data that shows woman have more money in their bank accounts in urban areas than men and women have more bank accounts than men. “It's pretty powerful and I'm sure the powers that be in Delhi have realised that women have more jobs, more bank accounts and more money in those bank accounts than men. And we, as the stock market, are trying to catch up with them,” he quipped.The third theme he said will continue to be energy transition. “We don't have to replicate the mistakes of China. The quicker we transition to EVs, the better. And if our EV ecosystem is efficient enough to become an exporter, then it also becomes a creator of jobs for the country,” he said. At Marcellus, Mukherjea said they are trying to capitalise on this theme as well.Also read: Why Saurabh Mukherjea avoids real estate investments: ‘Not sure where is money coming from’Expectations from the full budgetIn the July budget, Mukherjea expects that some tax changes may be announced. The second, he suggests, could be stepping up disinvestments. “There've been several misses on disinvestment for several years. Obviously before the elections there's no point trying to disinvest a big PSU, it is just not tenable,” he said. The third area that the full budget could include would be with regard to trade treaties. “I don't think it is likely that the government will sign trade treaties this side of the elections, but it's pretty likely that on the other side of the elections we will see some of these announcements,” he says.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Many agreements were sealed during the G20 summit last year and these would lead to India having better bilateral trade relations that can help improve our fiscal deficit.Also read: Budget Opinion: Expert takes and verdict on Modi's election budgetHow do you rate the budget on a scale of one to 10?It’s a one, if we look from the perspective of fresh announcements and developments since nothing significant has been announced, but it’s a 10 if we see for what it was, a vote-on-account for the current government to work for the next four months. The finance minister did a great job boasting of the ruling party’s achievements to secure a win in the upcoming elections, and that’s exactly what was expected today.Do you think the expectations have been increased for the full-year budget to be tabled in July?Definitely. It is almost certain that the ruling party will be re-elected. The interim budget, by barely speaking of focus sectors and new developments, has only increased the hopes of various industries as they hope for some allocations in July.Also read: Manufacturing companies face uncertainty as Budget mentions no extension of beneficial tax rateThe finance minister spoke greatly about the government’s past achievements and future plans, so the expectations are higher since the current government is expected to also be the winning party.Capex for FY25 seen at Rs 11.1 lakh crore against Rs 10 lakh crore in FY24, but FY24 capex has been revised to Rs 9.50 lakh crore. What is your take?This year’s allocation to infra is almost double the capex of FY22, so the capex has almost doubled in just two years. Given the requirements of a developing country like India, expenditure on infrastructure is essential for our economic growth. The railways were in focus during the speech but we are hoping to see more and definite commitments by the government towards improving infrastructure later in July.Do you expect big returns from the power and electrical vehicle (EV) segment in the coming years?In the budget, the FM put a lot of emphasis on green energy - from rooftop solarisation to MUFT energy to increasing focus on wind energy. We, as a fund house, are invested in many companies that are in proxy play with the electrical vehicle segment and these companies have given stellar performance on the back of good order books and push by the government through PLI schemes.Click Here To Read All Budget Related NewsIndia lags in EV penetration which is just 1-1.5 percent as compared to other countries like China and the US. Tesla has also been in talks about setting up a manufacturing plant in India, which portrays India as an up-and-coming top manufacturing destination. Considering India’s target of becoming carbon neutral by 2070, we can see good performance in these sectors.What do you expect from the next-generation reforms that the government is focussing on?The finance minister talked about public digital infrastructure, deep tech, and health infrastructure during her speech. The government is focussing on next-gen reforms with the encouragement of deep tech in defence with a new scheme and easily affordable credit for the tech industry. Women’s health also got some attention with the announcement to promote cervical cancer vaccines and maternal and child healthcare.The government has lowered its divestment target for FY24 to Rs 30,000 crore from Rs 50,000 crore and kept its Rs 50,000 crore for FY25. Do you think the targets will be achieved, given the rally in PSU stocks?We do not invest in PSUs, and therefore, we won't be able to assess the achievability of the lowered divestment target of Rs 30,000 crore for FY24 or speculate on the possibility of exceeding the Rs 50,000 crore target for FY25, considering the rally in PSU stocks.Are you betting big on the PSU Bank index that is the big outperformer in the dull market? What are the major reasons?We do not have significant investments in the PSUs, despite its notable outperformance in the lacklustre market.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

There was a fear that the STT tax would be revised upwards to slow down the futures & options market that was growing at breakneck speed.In fact, the market regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India had even reminded participants that 9 out of 10 traders lose money in F&O.But with the Interim Budget making no announcement on this, the STT on the sale of options will remain at Rs 6,250 per a turnover of Rs 1 crore and the same on sale of futures will remain Rs 1,250 on a turnover of Rs 1 crore.Earlier revisionSTT was introduced in 2004. It is levied on transactions involving various types of securities. All stock market transactions that involve equity or equity derivatives, such as futures and options (F&), are liable under STT, as are mutual fund transactions.The STT had been kept unchanged in the last Budget but the tax rates were revised later that year, through an amendment in the Finance Bill in March 2023.STT accounts for just 1.5 percent of the estimate of the direct tax collection of Rs 18.24 lakh crore.It might look like it is too small a percentage of the total but there are ancillary revenue streams such as from Goods and Services Tax (GST), stamp charges and exchange transaction fees. In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, Rajesh Baheti, Managing Director at Crosseas Capital Services, had said that any further hike in STT might not sit well with proprietary traders that make up 40-45 percent of F&O volumes.In an earlier interaction with Moneycontrol, Trivesh D, Chief Operating Officer of Tradejini, a broking firm, had said that when STT is hiked, it does not affect option buyers as much as it affects high-frequency traders and those selling options regularly. These groups are more sensitive to changes in market conditions and are likely to be impacted the most.Also read: Big Picture | Options trading mania cooling off; amateur traders exiting as profits shrinkThe real effect of the STT hike becomes visible if there is a bear market, added Trivesh.“I firmly believe that for India to establish itself as a price influencer for its produced and consumed commodities, it is imperative to maintain low transaction costs,” he had said."

Sitharaman on Thursday announced a Rs 11.11 lakh crore spending on infrastructure and vowed to continue reforms as she resisted resorting to populist measures in the Modi government’s last Budget before general elections.Instead, she chose to stay on the path of cutting deficit while bolstering measures for focus groups. Presenting a vote on account or an interim Budget for 2024-25, Sitharaman proposed no changes in income tax rates for individuals and corporates, as well as import duty, but offered amnesty for disputed income tax demands of the period prior to 2014-15 as a relief to small taxpayers.In her close to an hour-long Budget speech in the Lok Sabha, she listed her government’s achievements across sectors in the last 10 years and announced measures to boost tourism, housing and renewable energy. ”Normally in an election year, we generally see a populist budget. However, the finance minister has put the growth in clear perspective with prudence taking over populism in this Budget.It outlines development that will be all-round, all-inclusive, and all-pervasive towards making India a Viksit Bharat by 2047. There has been no change in corporate and income tax rates. ""In a nut shell interim Budget just ensures strong fiscal discipline and continuity of policies,” said Amisha Vora, Chairperson & Managing Director, Prabhudas Lilladher Group. Last year on the Budget day, the BSE benchmark ended at 59,708.08 points, up by 158.18 points, or 0.26 per cent.

This Budget lays emphasis on fiscal products and gives room for private capital investment into the growth of India. ”Continuing with the trends of the last 10 years, the FM once again lays on the foundation for a very strong path for India with due focus on areas of national importance,” Sundararaman Ramamurthy, MD & CEO, BSE, said.In 2020, the BSE bechmark fell 987.96 points or 2.42 per cent and in the preceding year, it clocked a gain of 212.74 points or 0.58 per cent.

There is a continued focus of the government on infrastructure development, the scope of which has been broadened to three areas — physical infrastructure, digital infrastructure and social infrastructure — which are seen to be the building blocks for growth. The intention is to make the development sustainable as well as inclusive, keeping in mind the vast diversity of the Indian population.The ongoing theme of the government on enhancing the reach and efficiency of transportation, logistics and travel has been gathering steam one budget after another, especially in the areas of railways, metro rail, ports and airports. Rural development also continues to be a focus area, as there is a thrust on agriculture and food processing, including oilseeds, dairy and aquaculture (set up of five integrated aquaparks).Click Here To Read All Budget HighlightsSocial measures aimed at inclusive development continue in the areas of women, healthcare and housing. In addition to the existing Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Grameen), an additional scheme for housing for the middle class will be launched.The intent to ask states to undertake the development of iconic tourist centres is a progressive initiative, as this will likely have a positive long-term impact on business, entrepreneurship and connectivity.There are no tax changes announced in the budget, despite mounting expectations lately in the media about some concessions. The focus, however, continues to be on reforms in taxation and enhancing the base of tax filers – both direct taxes and indirect taxes (GST). The current uptrend of GST collections indicates that there is a good buoyancy in GST collections, both in terms of amount as well as number of GST filers, leading to an improvement in supply chain logistics.Budgeted tax revenue growth seems conservative at 11.9 percent and actual revenues are likely to be higher. There are also ongoing efforts to reduce subsidies. Revenue expenditure as percent of GDP continues to decline (FY25 budgeted estimate at 10.4 percent vs FY24 budgeted estimate at 10.7 percent).There is some relief provided in the form of withdrawal of old tax demands, to probably reduce procedural hassles for taxpayers. One disappointment is that there is no direct stimulus to spur consumption; instead, the focus on infrastructure suggests that the Government has prioritized long-term growth.A key highlight in the Budget speech was the reiteration of the Government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit for the current year (FY24) has been marginally revised down to 5.8 percent (versus 5.9 percent earlier budgeted estimate), while the next financial year’s deficit is targeted at 5.1 percent (versus the consensus expectation of 5.3 percent), with a forward path of achieving 4.5 percent by FY26. This augurs well for the fixed-income markets, as the market borrowings (by the government) are likely to be under control.Further, although the inflation is a bit on the higher side, the inflation trajectory is established within the RBI’s tolerance zone, leaving some room for the RBI to soften policy rates later in the year, once the global rate cycle starts reversing.From a stock market perspective, there is no major/direct impact of the Budget; the capex push and fiscal consolidation augur well for the overall market sentiment. With this event now over, the stock market will shift its focus on Q3FY23 earnings and global cues. The earnings season so far has been in line with expectations, although some sectors such as Financials and Consumption have seen some strain.

Nomura expects this is the correct strategy for the EV market as the market will become more competitive at the lower price point.Motilal Oswal also expects the JLR volumes to be strong going forward due to easing chip shortages and traction for the new launches.Brokerages are also eyeing a strong EBITDA margin for Tata Motors in Q3 due to better pricing.

For the Interim Budget 2024, expectations were high that the finance minister would announce a slew of measures and capex. The total railway capex, including Extra Budgetary Resources, have gone up 1.9 percent YoY to Rs 2,65,200 crore. In the budget, the government announced that it is setting up three major railway corridors to reduce congestion and logistics costs for energy, mineral, and cement, connecting to main clusters, including enhanced port connectivity.That apart, the finance minister also announced that 40,000 normal trains will be upgraded to Vande Bharat standards. The NAMO trains and metro rail services will be  extended to more cities. This, along with the strong focus on tourism, means there is more opportunity for capacity expansion, redevelopment, and electrification of  railway lines.KEC International has strong presence in railways and higher capex for the development of corridors should benefit. We also feel that railway PSUs such as RVNL, IRCON, and RITES should continue to benefit in the light of these plans.The defence expenditure estimate for FY25 has broadly remained unchanged at around Rs 4.54 lakh crore. A ground-breaking provision in the budget allocates a substantial corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore, offering a 50-year interest-free loan for long-term financing, refinancing, and projects with negligible interest rates. This strategic financial move is poised to trigger a surge in research and development (R&D) across pivotal sectors, namely high-end manufacturing, defence, renewables, net zero, and decarbonisation. Companies at the forefront of R&D investments, such as MTAR and Data Patterns, stand to benefit significantly from this unprecedented initiative.Beyond immediate cost savings, this financial support addresses the critical need to manage the prolonged funding requirements inherent in extensive R&D projects. These projects often navigate protracted trails and approval cycles, making the extended loan term and interest-free nature of the financing instrumental in sustaining their progress. This visionary budgetary allocation not only stimulates innovation but also reinforces India's position on the global economic stage, signalling a commitment to foster advancements in technology, sustainability, and strategic sectors."

""We will expand the EV ecosystem by encouraging the adoption of electric mobility in the public transport sector,"" Sitharaman said in her budget speech.This announcement sent shares of EV manufacturers like JBM Auto as well as EV component makers, including Servotech Power and Samvardhana Motherson up by 2-5 percent.PSU Bank stocksThe government's decision to reduce its borrowing plan for FY25 to Rs 14.1 lakh crore as against Rs 15.1 lakh crore in FY24 triggered strong buying across PSU bank stocks. This is because a fall in the government's borrowing plan helps ease yields, which benefits PSU bank players as they invest heavy chunks of capital in treasury bonds.On that account, most PSU bank stocks, including Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, UCO Bank, South Indian Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Bank of Baroda and PNB moved 3-8 percent higher.What the market liked and did not in Interim BudgetDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

One was the fiscal deficit target (which has been set at 5.1 percent of GDP) and the slowing down in public capex to 11 percent YoY from the 30 percent growth seen for the last three years. Second was the focus on energy transition – EV charging stations, rooftop solar and so on. “My reckoning is that there is far more in EV which we will hear post the elections,” he said.The third theme was affordable housing. The Interim Budget has allocated Rs 80,671 crore for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and Sitharaman said that the government will launch a scheme that will help deserving among the middle class to buy or build their own homes, without getting into the details.From these announcements, Mukherjea said that the government seemed keen on re-emphasising the housing space.From an investment perspective, Mukherjea said that they have holdings in building materials space, affordable housing, and have also recently bought into energy transition. “(I hope) the fiscal consolidation will give more space for RBI to cuts rates and help our private sector bank investments with liquidity,” he added.Mukherjea expected more tangible steps such as more Production-linked Incentive Schemes (PLIS) and Faster Adoption & Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) allocations, which will allow India to step up and fill the void in the global market created by the economic challenges being faced China.(Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Higher-than-expected borrowings can push up rates for all bond issuers — sovereign and corporate — while interest rates can decline if the government tightens its belt and borrows less than anticipated.Borrowings are loans taken by the government to fund its spending on public services.

Moreover, prices are stuck in a range. Considering the divergent signals from price and momentum indicator, the Nifty is likely to witness range bound price action. Key support levels are 21550 – 21500 while immediate hurdle zone is placed at 21850 – 21900.Bank Nifty witnessed continuation of the positive momentum. During the day, it was the bank Nifty which held on the crucial support zone of 45660 – 45700 where the hourly moving averages were placed and resumed its upmove. We believe that the Bank Nifty is likely to move higher towards 46570 – 46800 from short term perspective. The Daily momentum indicator has triggered a positive crossover which is a buy signal and is likely to provide speed to the upmove.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The reports had suggested that the goverment planned to replace 8 lakh diesel buses with electric ones by 2030 including 2 lakh buses running for the state transport service. That is a massive increase from the 4,000 electric buses currently plying on the Indian roads.A CNBC report had said that, under FAME-III, the ministry was considering a 50 percent domestic value addition (DVA) requirement and doing away with the phased manufacturing programme (PMP). The latter was conceived after various two-wheelers were found to have claimed PMP incentives despite using imported parts. These two wheelers were later fined for the violation.Government sources had even said that two-wheeler makers may be exempted from the FAME scheme since they they were the largest beneficiaries of the scheme so far.To encourage EV adoption, auto industry insiders had also hoped for parity in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates between EVs sold with fixed batteries (taxed at 5 percent) and EV sold with swappable lithium-ion batteries (taxed at 18 percent).Analysts had also recommended that import duty on lithium-ion battery cells be removed since the cells are not being manufactured in India now."

Diversion of sugarcane's sucrose for ethanol production can lead to rise in sugar prices, which won't be an outcome the government desires in an election year.In the pre-Budget survey, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), a lobby body of sugar producers, had told Moneycontrol that it wanted the government to allow additional 10-12 lakh tonnes of sucrose diversion towards ethanol production. They said that, even after allowing additional sugar for production of ethanol, closing sugar balance would be sufficient for a couple of months into the next season.They also pointed out that the sugarcane crop was more efficient in terms of water/nutrient/land use or carbon sequestration, compared to maize, and therefore deserved to be supported more by the government.The lobby body had also wanted the government to raise the procurement cost of ethanol produced from sugarcane Juice/ Syrup, B-Heavy Molasses and C-Heavy Molasses.Besides, that the industry wanted the government to raise the minimum support price (MSP) of sugar to be increased to Rs 38 per kg from Rs 31 per kg.The government had fixed MSP of sugar at Rs 31 per kg in February 2019 and the price had remained unchanged since then. However, the fair and renumerative price (FRP)--which the sugar mills are mandated to pay sugarcane framers--has gone up from Rs 2,550 per tonne in 2017-18 to Rs 3,050 per tonne for the year 2022-23."

The quote best sums up the market reaction to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s interim budget.For a change, the market went into the Budget with low expectations and so there was little scope for disappointment. The big positive was the government’s commitment to the path of fiscal discipline by setting a fiscal deficit target of 5.1 percent. While this may not be an immediate positive, it has the potential to translate into a long term positive through a potential upgrade in sovereign ratings by global rating agencies.That also means the government will need to borrow less to bridge the gap between its revenue and expenditure. And that has implications for interest rates in the system. With the US Fed having indicated that it is in no hurry to cut rates, the RBI too may be forced to defer its decision to cut rates.But if government borrowings are lower, interest rates should start cooling off even before the central bank formally cuts rate.“The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during 2024-25 are estimated at Rs 14.13 and Rs 11.75 lakh crore respectively,” Sitharaman said in her speech.Bond yields fell and the Nifty Bank index crossed over into green following the announcement.

That is pretty much in line with market expectations of an increase between 11-15 percent.The government’s capex plan has bearing for the capital goods, engineering, defence, railways, steel and cement stocks. Here too, the market reaction was one of indifference.As far as cap goods, engineering, railways and engineering stocks are concerned, none of them seem to be having a problem as far as their order books are concerned. What the market is looking closely at is how well these companies will be able to executed the orders they already have and whether valuations can expand further from these levels.Also Read | Budget proposes 3 major railway corridors, upgrading 40,000 trains to Vande Bharat statusThe market also heaved a sigh of relief on the status quo on securities transaction tax (STT) and long term capital gains tax. Also, there were no freebies or populist schemes that the market was worried about, since this was largely expected to be a political Budget.And yet, the market has reason to feel hopeful. Tax receipts for this fiscal have been ahead of government estimates, and this trend is expected to sustain in the year ahead. That, and the fact that the outlook on inflation is benign (unless geopolitical factors push crude higher), means that there is reason to believe that the government may get a bit more aggressive in its full Budget to be announced in July.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Additionally, KEI Industries sunk 1.8 percent to Rs 3,135.1 apiece.India's largest engineering, procurement and construction company would have benefitted if the finance minister announces another big bang capex spend for FY25. The company has been increasingly winning overseas orders, particularly from Middle East, while domestic orders have seen a slowdown.

Industrial stocks, which have been beneficiaries of increased public capex spending, have rallied significantly over the year.The BSE Industrials index gave a return of 65 percent over the last year. Shares of L&T, BHEL, HAL and ABB have risen between 32 percent and 166 percent during the period. This rally has been driven by increased allocation in infrastructure spending allocated by the government during the Budget of FY24.According to a Nuvama report, the government allocated Rs 14.9 lakh crore in the FY24 Budget to the infrastructure space, which was 32 percent higher than the previous year’s allocations of Rs 11.3 lakh crore. The brokerage was expecting a 15-16 percent increase in the Interim Budget.Jefferies had estimated that the allocation would grow only by 7-8 percent in the Interim Budget because of the need for fiscal consolidation. Its analysts said industrial stocks exposed to public capex would correct after announcements. But, they added, that a slowdown in government capex would not impact the overall capex cycle since the budget expenditure contributed only 15 percent to the overall gross fixed capital formation (GFCF).Other analysts estimated that the first half of FY25 would be tepid for industrial companies due to an expected slowdown in project execution. Rajarshi Maitra, Senior Analyst at Incred Equities, said the project execution slowed down by 4-5 percent during the previous election years.The order book-to-sales (OB-to-sales) ratio is also expected to go down from 3x in March 2023 to 2.4x in March 2024, Maitra added. This slowdown might result in lower revenue in the first quarter of FY25.Companies with healthy order books are expected to pick up after elections."

They were direct or indirect beneficiaries of the government spending in the previous two budgets.","One of the most dominant themes of the markets since the previous budget has been the consistent outperformance of small-cap stocks. Till January 25, the BSE Small Cap index has risen by ~60 percent since the previous budget, compared to 19 percent gains in the BSE Sensex.It was not just about smallcaps outperforming key benchmark indices by 3 times.The MSCI India Small Cap Index (USD) managed to outperform the MSCI Emerging Markets Small Cap (includes a small-cap representation across 24 emerging market countries) and the MSCI World Small Cap Index (USD), which captures a small-cap representation across 23 developed markets, by a considerable margin.It was a broad-based rally, with at least 250 stocks more than doubling since the previous budget. Almost 40 percent of the BSE Small Cap index constituents managed to outperform the small-cap index that tracks the performance of 940 small-cap stocks.“One year back, the small-cap stocks were undervalued,” says Purvesh Shelatkar, Head of institutional Broking, Monarch Networth Capital.Budget announcements and the government's capex spend played a major role in shaping the market sentiment over the past year. Power sector reforms, uptick in railway budgets and infra spending got investors excited about the stocks from these sectors.Almost all of the solar stocks rallied on the back of government announcements and higher allocation to the green energy sector, said Shelatkar.The previous budget allocated Rs 7,327 crore for the solar power sector, including grid, off-grid, and PM-KUSUM projects. This was 48 percent higher than the Rs 4,979 crore in the revised estimates in the document.The previous budget also saw a capital outlay of Rs 2.40 lakh crore, the highest ever for railways. Compared to 2022-23, the capex saw an increase of 65.6 percent and that magnified the rally in the railway stocks. It is widely expected that capital allocation will increase in 2024-25 for the railways to keep up the momentum in the sector.Within the small-cap space, outperformance was seen in power generation and distribution, engineering, and electrical equipment stocks, which were direct or indirect beneficiaries of government spending in the previous two budgets.Small-cap power generation and distribution stocks outperformPower generation and distribution stocks were among the top-performing stocks within the BSE Small Cap index. Fifteen power generation/distribution stocks, which are index constituents, on an average, delivered 177 percent since the previous budget.Interestingly, except the Indian Energy Exchange, which declined since the previous budget, all the BSE Small Cap Index constituents from this sector have outperformed the BSE Small Cap index returns of ~60 percent.Electrical equipment stocks post multibagger returnsAnother interesting broad-based sectoral outperformance was seen in the electrical equipment stocks. Fifteen index constituents from the space delivered, on an average, 185.93 percent returns, with at least nine stocks more than doubling since the previous budget.  Engineering sector stocks shineFrom the engineering and industrial equipment space, 63 constituents of the BSE Small Cap Index have delivered, on average, returns of over 105 percent. Almost 42 stocks, out of this list of 63, outperformed the fast-growing BSE Small Cap index i.e., generating returns over 60 percent, while an impressive list of 33 stocks turned out to be multibaggers for the period. Here is the list of the top 15 smallcap gainers from the engineering space.Given the strong outperformance over the last year, there are doubts that the momentum can be sustained. “Investors should ignore market capitalisation and focus on a bottom-up stock-picking approach while spending time on selecting the right sector to invest in,"" said Shelatkar.""Having said that, the smallcaps, as a space, are not available cheap any longer; in fact, it is in an overvalued zone. I believe that allocation to defence and railways will remain intact. It may go up as more and more routes need to be electrified as well as the network needs to be widened to be built in remote areas. Hotels, transport, and logistics companies still have a long way to go. Capital goods and engineering space still have steam left. Solar, hydrogen energy and wind energy are important sectors and still have room for growth.”Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The political backdrop is also such that the pressure on doing such [schemes] appears to be also limited. But some small tweaks can always be done,” he said.One such tweak could be an increase in the PM-KISAN scheme amount from Rs 6,000 a year to Rs 9,000 annually.“In our estimate, revenue expenditure as a proportion of GDP should be falling this year compared to last year,” he added.Housing focusSoumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic advisor at State Bank of India, has a similar view but added that there could be some sort of announcement or roadmap for a larger overall picture in the next couple of years in terms of some of the programmes that the government is likely to envisage. The focus could be on one of the most-discussed programmes of the government – the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which aims to provide the poor with access to housing.Kaushik Das, chief economist for India and South Asia at Deutsche Bank, said that while it would be nice to see announcements on tax cuts, he is doubtful about such proposals because it is an interim budget.“Maybe in the first week of July when the new budget is presented, we could have some changes. A lot of things have been announced even before the budget. So I don't expect something which would look hugely populist and they've been good in managing the fiscal deficit before elections,” he said.Ghosh said that when it comes to capital expenditure, the government will again give a positive surprise. In her budget speech a year earlier, Sitharaman said the capital investment outlay is being increased for the third year in a row by 33 percent to Rs 10 lakh crore, which would be 3.3 percent of GDP.Also read: MC Budget Panel | Banks to continue to face pressure on NIMs, experts say“I won't be surprised if the growth continues to be in double digits. We are pencilling in a growth of around 13 percent to 14 percent, which means it could be close to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal,” Ghosh said.On expectations about divestment, Das said that while one may not expect a very big number, what often happens is that stake sales in government companies require time to get approved.“Some years, you could be lucky and you could get bunched-up divestments happening if the markets are doing well. So maybe in FY25, we could be lucky and get the money that we did not get in the previous few years. So that way, it could be a positive upside surprise. But I think they'll show around Rs 50,000 to 65,000 crore in this budget,” he said.The government has collected Rs 12,504.32 crore so far compared with a target of Rs 51,000 crore from disinvestment in FY24.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

Edited excerpts:What are your expectations from today’s Budget?In general, I am not expecting a lot of changes. One thing is that they need to provide the fiscal path which I think they will do as now with the Bond Index inclusion foreign investors will also be looking at us in terms of debt money flow. Beyond that, I think controlling the fiscal, if one has to continue spends because that is the need of an hour, I think there should be some moderation in terms of spends. But it is going to be critical that how you are going to balance the two, and how much spending growth you are going to announce. The second is that inflation is definitely hurting the people at the bottom end of the pyramid. What the government can do is maybe pump up the growth momentum or give some comfort or confidence on the consumption part, because I think that's important if you want holistic growth. I think some announcements on schemes like Awas Yojana should be made because while the overall real estate is doing well the affordable has slowed and the premium and luxury realty has caught up.Also read: As Sensex, Nifty eye budget momentum, here’s how markets moved during Modi’s past budgetsDo you expect the markets to be volatile?I think overall the relevance of the Budget from the market’s volatility has been reducing over a period because a lot of the announcements are outside the Budget. From that perspective, I don't think that the continuity of this government is more relevant today or the continuity of reforms in the long term. Hence, the Budget from that perspective should not be a big event to create volatility.Do you expect the interest in segments like defence and railways to continue?My view is that the government could continue to keep investing in segments like defence and railways because there is definitely a need and they believe that these are all rightful investments, so I don't think that they would like to curtail these investments, but the delta change here is going to slow down. If 30 percent was the growth in some of these areas, it may come down to let's say 10-12 percent as fiscal is also something which they have to balance. From that perspective, I think, the relevance of these investments into these segments is going to continue. But as investors I will be watchful in terms of what my current valuations are baking in, if it is baking in a very high growth and which then becomes a bit ambitious in terms of achievement then I'll have to calibrate my weights accordingly.What is your outlook for the market going ahead?The way it looks is what we have seen in 2023. Ideally, it looks a bit stretched to assume similar kinds of returns because the growth momentum is actually slowing and valuations are at highs. This is not a good combination to start with. Hence, as we progress into the next few quarters maybe and as we realise that growth recovery is not happening as expected then I think there's room for good consolidation in the market. We may not see sharp corrections because I think corrections will also get bought into because the long-term looks good. But the point is that in the market there is good room for consolidation. I feel that this could be more of a year where returns will look challenging.Also read: Union Budget@10: A decade of renewable energy surge, but transmission and manufacturing lagWhat would you advise investors for this year?I think the first important thing I am seeing is that there is definitely a digression which is happening on the quality front. There is a natural shift which is taking place from not-so-quality businesses also. Retail investors are becoming very bold and returns are very easy to come by. So, I think this is again not a great combination, and hence investors at this point should remain cautious and try to move out of non-quality and try and get into quality businesses even if it doesn't serve a very high return purpose for them in the short term.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

According to Agrawal, private sector banks are also facing leadership change challenges –- from transition time to strict regulations. “At the same time, the economy is flying, and there is massive competition,” he adds.In Part 3 of his conversation with Moneycontrol, Agrawal spoke about opportunities for IT stocks, challenges of leadership in banking, and competition with China. Edited excerpts:Also watch: Strategy 2024: Where To Invest? What To Avoid? Sustainability of The Bull Run | Raamdeo AgrawalWhat are the principles you follow for buying into dips?The first thing is that I am 100 percent invested at the top as well as at the bottom. That's my principle. I have never been in cash because it is beyond my capability to call the top and then sit through the entire fall and call the bottom. I think somebody can call the bottom, or somebody can call the top. Both cannot happen. And unless both happen, there's no point in calling. If I have Rs 100 crore, I will buy stocks worth Rs 100 crore. Within that, what stocks to buy and which sector to bet on? Those are the issues that keep us busy. But for allocation, I tell the client, if you are 50 percent in equity, be allocated 50 percent. Your risk appetite is for 25 percent, go to 25 percent. I have worked this way so far, and it has worked brilliantly for me. I've seen three cuts of more than 50 percent in my portfolio -- 1992, 2001, and 2008. But it is okay to see three cuts in around 40 years. But the beauty is that in one year, it comes back.I remember in 2000, you had said that one of the learnings from that cycle for you was that you thought quality would sustain value. But even Infosys…Infosys I sold close to 80 percent, near the top. But with that money, I bought junk, which went to zero and never came back. At least Infosys, after three years, came back. I would have been better off not doing that. That's a learning from the past.In bad times, you like to compromise on quality. During that time, the good-quality stocks move first. And behind that, the lower-quality stocks start moving, and you want to be part of the action all the time. You start diluting your portfolio, and finally, whenever the dust settles, you have all the junk in your portfolio. The issue is that the trend is external, the liquidity flow is external, and I can do nothing about it. Instead, I see how I can take care of myself by sticking to my investment philosophy. If something doesn't fit with my philosophy, I may feel bad to see that a stock is doing well and that I don't have it in my portfolio. But that's fine. And second, is that it is not about the performance of one stock; it is about 100 percent of your portfolio.Also watch: Thanks to SEBI, markets are safe: Motilal Oswal’s Raamdeo Agrawal lauds digital controlIf the Chinese economy is unable to recover, is there a possibility of dumping, which could destroy a lot of industries here? Will that take away from our profits? Wherever you are competing with China head-on, you always have this threat. Even when you are doing well, there's always a threat that China can dump and finish off (India's) profits today. But the good thing is that in services, they are not there. Sixty percent of the economy is services. So, in all the service-oriented industries, or within manufacturing and even consumer goods, there's no competition. Competition is only in the industrials, tradeable industrials such as steel or other metals, and some chemicals. That's where the real competition is.Till a few years ago, the specialty chemicals sector did well. But over the last one and a half years, the stocks have gone down 50 percent. Are these good buying opportunities?Special chemicals, as a sector, are very company-specific. The question is, do we have a global competitive advantage? One of the problems is Indian cost versus American value. That's the beauty of Indian IT. You manufacture at $5, and you sell at $25. There is enough margin out there because you are competing with American producers, where $20 per hour is the minimum wage. There, the minimum wage for a competent guy is more like $60 to $80, or maybe even $100. Against that, you are giving hardly $5 or $10. You have a huge competitive advantage. But when you come to manufactured products like chemicals or steel, you are looking at Indian costs versus Chinese prices. There's also China's scale, subsidies, and other things. Even if an American manufacturer would like to shift from China to India, he would want a price that would be competitive with China for him to make the shift. How do we give a competitive price? The margin will always be a challenge.When you're competing with China in terms of price, you might get the volume. Any buyer from Europe and America will prefer Indian products, but they want Chinese prices.Is the use of PLI schemes to address these segments just a makeshift or tactical move?Somewhere you have to begin; you have to get some basic volumes. The government is saying that they will fund the companies to manufacture in India, but do the stuff here, do the validation in India. But it is a challenge. The government plus Indian manufacturers — are they good enough to see the competition coming from China? Because (China) is very passionate and very organised, and they have scaled up. But you can't give up as a country. Getting a competitive advantage, a global competitive advantage, in manufacturing takes time.How do you see the IT space, especially with regard to the risk from AI?The challenge is for large companies. Mid-sized companies will be able to manoeuvre. The IT spend is not going away anywhere. If the world is growing at 5 percent, the IT spend is also growing at 5 percent. In fact, there's more pressure on the IT budget — they need to do 6 percent or 7 percent. Some of the IT leaders were asking, why should it be stuck at 5 percent when health insurance is at 12 percent? It should also rise because the need of the hour is digitisation. They are asking about a larger budget, and then with the Indian cost structure, the competitive advantage is so high that even with AI, which will make it happen for the companies, it's not going to happen. You have to go and implement those solutions. That will again be done by Indians. We'll be the best at executing AI.Now the issue is that after using AI, the programming, and all those long-cycle projects, can it come down in terms of timeline, say, instead of 90 days, can it be done in 30 days or 10 days? If so, there will be demand. The demand for software is unlimited. So, when you bring down the price, the demand for the software will explode. So, the explosion in volume and the reduction in the cycle time for the software will work out brilliantly for the Indian IT companies as we go along. That's my sense.Are you bullish on IT companies?Not in the short term, but I am also not bearish. Also, I think they are wonderful companies, and we must have some portion allocated to the stocks. These are very high ROE, high free cash flow, extremely well-governed, professionally managed, and globally competitive companies. So we must have them in the portfolio.What are your thoughts on public sector bank valuations now?Till 2004-05, 55 percent of wealth was created by PSUs. Then it started coming down and became zero last year. So it had to reverse. In the market, value discovery keeps happening. If there was anything left out six months or nine months back after the first flush of the bull run, at the index of about 17,000–18,000, it was all the PSUs. And that's how the market went about discovering them. They were, in any case, (companies that gave) 5-7 percent dividend yield (at) PE multiples of mid- or low single-digits. If you can get any company at a PE multiple of five and it is a large, monopolistic company, what stops you? Clearly, there was the deepest possible value, but they were very unpopular for whatever reason. And companies, irrespective of their performance, kept on going lower and lower in value. But now it is reversing. The character of the PSUs will remain the same. Whatever their problems were earlier, I don't think they are getting sorted out immediately. But what the market did was also unreasonable with their correction.How do you size up this opportunity between private banks and public sector banks?The stories for both are different. The opportunity for private banks to win market share from PSU banks continues, but they have their challenges of leadership change. It takes some time for transition. And our regulators have been very strict on the old management, which I find challenging for the transition. These are all huge companies. For the new management, without the supervision of the old management, (things can be) very tough. And at the same time, the economy is flying, and there is massive competition. PSU banks have also come back. The books are clean. Now everybody's balance sheet is as pristine as can be, and opportunity is there. So they have their own liability franchise, so they are giving tough competition to private sector banks.What looks good now in the segment… You have to go bank by bank. Somewhere you get good leadership, somewhere you get very low valuation, somewhere you get very good growth, etc. It’s a combination. The banking sector is going to grow, and you will get opportunities there. But you have to figure out where is the sunset of the leadership. That has become a new surprise, and that is taking the entire sector out. Because if the largest of the banks are passing through transition and they don't scale up in terms of valuation, then others can't scale up.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

In previous instances, like 2019, people didn't have the mandate. So, comparing what people did in the past with the present could be a bit unfair,” he says.","While most market analysts are of the view that the February 1 Budget will be a non-event and the main Budget will be announced post elections, Nandik Mallik, CIO, Avendus Capital Alternate Strategies, has a unique perspective - that the government would treat this as a regular Budget. Mallik also shared his views on expectations from taxation and capex in the upcoming Budget. Edited excerpts:Also read: Modi Budget@10 | Direct tax collection to triple to Rs 19 lakh crore in 10 years under Modi governmentWhat are your expectations from the Budget?My strong view is this will be more than an interim Budget. There is no rule which says that you can't disclose now what you want to disclose in June.. If the market is anticipating 30 percent now and 70 percent afterwards, I think at least 50-50 percent, if not 60-40 percent, in terms of what they will disclose in this Budget. This time around they have the mandate. In previous instances, like 2019, the then governments didn't have the mandate. So, comparing present governments with what governments did in the past could be a bit unfair. This time, I think, the Budget in terms of fiscal also will have less populism. So many people think that June will be the main Budget. I have a reverse view that this will be the main one and what will happen in June will be a non-event.Are we setting ourselves up for a big rally today?I don’t think the market is too focused on populism. I think it is focused more on taxation and whether they will change that. I personally feel it will not matter. I think even if they increase the short term (taxation) from 10-15 percent, there may be a very short-term reaction to it but in the long term it won't matter. I think the long-term push of the government is to ensure less taxation leakage. Even if they announce an increase in short term (taxation) and reduce income tax by 2-3 percent for the highest bracket, I think that kind of balances each other out sentiment-wise. There might be a short blip.Is there anything else that you think will be the focus?No, I think the main thing will be taxation, and it will happen, if not now then in June. I think 60 percent of the Budget will be front-loaded. They will not leave much for the second Budget. There's no rule which says that you can't say what you want to say on the floor of the house. At worst, what you said can be reversed by the next government.What will the market be disappointed about with regards to capex spending and what will it be surprised about?I don't think there will be any significant deviations from what the expectations are. With regards to capex spending, previously what used to happen was a lot of it would be hidden in the fine print. But they have the mandate, they don't actually have to do it.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions."

Going forward, he expects a shift from pure banking to capital markets.“Till about 2020, there was an acute shortage of equity for entrepreneurs. And if your equity was not there, it was a challenge for the debt as well. That's why there was a hollow between 2010 and 2020. Now you have excess liquidity because people are bringing in their hard-earned savings,” he adds.In Part 2 of his conversation with Moneycontrol, Agrawal spoke about themes he is positive about, what he expects from the budget, and what he is cautious about going ahead. Edited excerpts:What are the long-term themes that you are positive about?I have been in this market for 40 years and have never seen a change like what we are going through. During COVID-19, the physical KYC was given a pass, and digital onboarding started. Suddenly, every month, we started getting 10 times more customers — from around 0.4 million to four million. At that time, the total number of demat accounts was about 40 million. In three years, we have now reached 140 million. There is a massive network effect. Now markets have gone to Tier-3, Tier-4 (towns), and, in some cases, probably villages as well. My sense is that in the next five to seven years, this 140 million could grow to 300 million — around 30 million per year — and the existing investors are giving more money because they are doing well. Finally, the shift from pure banking to capital markets will happen. Instead of putting your money into bank deposits, you'll start putting some of it in the capital markets.This is going to become very vigorous as the participation depth increases and people test the power of equity in India. Till about 2020, there was an acute shortage of equity for entrepreneurs. And if your equity was not there, it was a challenge for the debt as well. That's why there was a hollow between 2010 and 2020. Now you have excess liquidity because people are bringing in their hard-earned savings.Also watch: Strategy 2024: Where to invest? What to avoid? Sustainability of the bull run | Raamdeo Agrawal ExclFIIs have lost 3 percent of the market share, and my sense is they'll keep losing market share. I don't think they'll buy because they have other markets that are much cheaper. But domestic money will stay here and take care of the market, and it will horizontally expand. So it's a very interesting time.My only fear is that the market should not become parabolic the way it did in 1992 — the first bull run. Those lessons, and the challenges and problems of the first bull market are still not over. The sector for the next 10 years is the capital market. Then you have the rest of the financial sector, which will also do very well. Like your insurance products will do well, health insurance, in particular, will do well.Are there any other sectors/themes?Then you have the capex boom — general capex as well as very specialised ones, railways, defense, infrastructure, and so on. All those capex companies will do well.Then there is a massive wealth effect because the stock markets have done well. So all the people who are holders of shares, they have seen appreciation beyond their imagination. They will open their purses, go buy houses and cars, and travel. So, all this trickle-down will happen. The government's tax collection will also do well, even beyond what the government is estimating. That will allow the government to raise social sector spending as well as the capex for infrastructure.Does the power space excite you?Yes. Recently, the government said they wanted to ensure 24x7 power for India. So, I think the power generation capacity has to be built up. We are also talking about building some more thermal power plants and renewables. In any case, they are roaring and have a huge cascading effect on all sorts of utility companies as well as the capex companies. In 2008, what happened was that power and cement had private sector capex. And this time, it was completely missing so far. Now, the demand-led power shortage is leading to yet another start of setting up power plants. This will be a multi-year trend, as it's a global shortage, not only in India. And power is one thing you cannot import. And as your economy is surging at 7 percent, I would think power demand will grow at 8 to 10 percent.So you are saying that we are probably in the third year of the bull run. How do you reorient your portfolio at this stage?The first thing is that I'm fully allocated. So I'm sticking to that. The only fear is that it (the market) moves parabolically, that is, go up eight times or 10 times and then drops by 50 percent. It is inevitable and has happened three times. There is no reason why it will not happen a fourth time. It is the nature of the market.Is there any one thing that you can call out that really worries you?The volume of options and the kind of complexity of it. The rest all is fine, in the sense that we are doing very well. It should just not become parabolic. Otherwise, we are fine. I mean, there will be corrections. There'll be one or two years of no return. That'll be good; that'll be healthy. But I don't think I see a disaster in this.What are you expecting in this budget?It's an interim budget. They'll wait for two more months. I think I would look for the expected GDP numbers for the next year. These numbers will all translate into the budget.What are the three things in the market that could surprise?One big event is elections, post elections how the FIIs behave. Will they actually come back because they are feeling left out? And if they come back with $40 -$50 billion because they've burned enough money in China, my sense is that can have a very huge impact on the performance of large-caps, which has been somewhat muted in the past. If they come back with a vengeance, I think you'll see a lot of action. It can change the character of the market; it can shift from mid- and small-caps to large-caps because ultimately they'll go where money is being made.Other events could be the performance of corporate profits, oil prices coming down sharply, or interest rates being cut very sharply.Also read: Budget 2024: Boost for AI likely, industry urges separate budgets and accelerated R&DWhat could disappoint?I'm always worried about corporate earnings because if corporate earnings are intact, whatever happens in the market is (transitory)... it will come back.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

Nifty 50 recouped almost all its previous day's gains in the rebound.Nifty technical setupAfter recent recovery from 21,137, the Nifty 50 faced significant resistance at 21,750-21,850 area. If the index manages to close decisively above 21,850 on the budget day and sustains there for few days, then the psychological 22,000 mark can't be ruled out in following days, while the 21,500 is the near-term support and 21,300 is expected to be crucial support for the index, experts said, adding though the significant volatility during the speech may be a possibility.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionOn January 31, the BSE Sensex climbed over 600 points to 71,752, and the Nifty 50 jumped over 200 points to 21,726, while the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices gained 1.6 percent and 2.25 percent respectively.""It would be crucial to see which side the index gives a breakout.

Put writing at a particular strike price, is usually considered as a sign of support getting stronger and strong possibility of prices moving higher.

This clarification comes after the RBI asked Paytm Payments Bank to stop new credit and deposit operations, top-ups, fund transfers, and other such banking operations by February 29, 2024.At present, Vijay Shekhar Sharma is Paytm's largest shareholder and Significant Beneficial Owner. In August 2023, Vijay Shekhar Sharma acquired a 10 percent stake from AntFin through his 100 percent-owned overseas entity Resilient Asset Management BV, thereby increasing his holding to 19.42 percent. AntFin went on to sell another 3 percent stake later in Paytm via block deals.As of December 2023, AntFin holds a 9.9 percent stake in Paytm. Sharma is still looking to increase his stake in the company further.

Analysts at Jefferies estimate the direct impact of the RBI's action on Paytm's wallets and payments business to be around 20-30 percent of its EBITDA. The firm also feels that a reputational impact on lending partnerships can affect Paytm's EBITDA further by 20-25 percent.This might be extremely problematic for the fintech major, which has been trying to increase its profitability. For the quarter ended December 2023, Paytm reported a 38 percent on-year (YoY) increase in revenue at Rs 2,850 crore, and its consolidated net loss narrowed to Rs 220 crore. The company's EBITDA before employee stock option (ESOP) grew to Rs 219 crore.There were expectations that Paytm would likely report breakeven on EBITDA in FY25.

Edited excerpts:Which are the areas to focus on in the interim budget that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present on February 1?In the forthcoming speech by the Finance Minister, there are key areas to pay attention to. Specifically, we should closely examine the revised estimate for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of FY2023-24, providing insights into the economic trajectory. Additionally, the expected fiscal deficit for the financial year will be a crucial indicator, shedding light on the government's fiscal policies and management.Click Here To Read All Budget Related NewsDo you expect any negative surprise from the government in the interim budget that can hit the market sentiment?With national elections set to take place in a few months, it's unlikely that the government will introduce significant measures that could adversely impact market sentiment. However, investors anticipating tax incentives or populist measures may not find them materialising in the budget, potentially leading to some disappointment.Overall, while major negative surprises are not expected, it's essential for investors to align their expectations with the government's likely focus on stability rather than radical policy shifts during this interim period.Do you believe IT services cycle will turn in the current year? Should one stay invested in the space?The prospects of the IT services industry remain robust. The current cycle is influenced more by short-term uncertainties and client caution, driven in part by increased interest rates and investments in AI (artificial intelligence). The industry is poised for improved activity and growth once the central bank initiates interest rate reductions.However, it's crucial to note that Gen AI may introduce disruptive changes to the industry. Historically, IT services companies have heavily relied on labour and maximising chargeability for resources. Going forward, companies that effectively navigate the intersection of technology and labour arbitrage will likely emerge as leaders in the sector.Staying invested in the IT services space seems prudent, provided companies can adapt to the evolving landscape and leverage advancements in technology and workforce strategies.Click Here For All Live Updates on Budget 2024What is your take on corporate earnings season and management commentaries?It has been a mixed bag in terms of Q3FY24 reporting. While the earnings report of banks was in line with market expectations, many of the banks have seen extreme volatility in their market caps. Across the board, banks faced challenges relating to higher deposits, lower NIMs and overall, a negative sentiment relating to future earnings. The largest bank in India, HDFC Bank, saw its shares fall approximately 14 percent post result announcement, while others banks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also saw wild swings in their share prices.On the other hand, the IT companies reported earnings which were mostly lower than market expectations. However, the future outlook for majority of the companies seems to be improving, resulting in their share prices witnessing significant movements. For instance, TCS and Wipro saw their shares go up by approximately 6 percent and 13 percent, respectively, after the earning reports before falling back to pre-earnings levels. Infosys shares are up more than 10 percent since result announcement.FMCG appears to be facing a tough time with inflation and higher interest rates leading to market contractions.The diverse industry-specific drivers are evident both in earnings reports and management commentaries. Investors should carefully analyse these factors to make informed decisions amidst the complex landscape.Which are the factors that helped you to believe in India story?The robustness of India’s economy has been consistently demonstrated, especially in the recent few years through the tumultuous period of COVID-19, oil price rise, Ukraine-Russia war, rampant inflation in many developed countries, etc. Still, India is poised to be the fastest growing economy.Further, the sheer headroom available for growth in India is an immensely attractive proposition for business which are investing heavily in the country. And with a stable government and consistency in regulations, the growth story for India should deliver significant gains for investors over the next decade for sure.Just looking at the current per capita income, and stability in the political landscape with minimal fiscal profligacy is a recipe for success in the medium to long term.Do you think the market is expecting four-six cuts in Fed rates in 2024?As the saying goes, it's not over until the fat lady sings. Similarly, the equity markets won't fully factor in four-six cuts in the Fed funds rate until they materialise. The Fed Chairman has consistently exercised caution, refraining from providing any concrete indication of rate cuts. He has emphasised that rate adjustments will only be considered once inflation is fully under control.However, for the Indian stock markets, the rate cuts might play a secondary role in the first half of 2024. The primary focus will likely be on political developments leading up to the national elections expected in May.Do you see lot of opportunities in Index plus/Alpha funds?Index plus strategies have beaten Nifty year-on-year by over 12 percent. Unfortunately, investors are unable to take exposure into these funds due to lack of awareness or a high entry barrier of Rs 1 crore, which is the minimum investment size.Most of the stock-picking funds dive into midcaps and smallcaps, exposing themselves to wild market cap movements while still managing to underperform indices compared to Index Plus funds that smartly focus on the stability of largecaps, while outperforming them month-on-month using FnO (Futures and Options) strategies.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Fortunately, in January 2024, the said counter managed to clear its Rs 240 resistance very comfortably and is currently placed near Rs 270 zone.The breakout on the monthly chart looks genuine since it is accompanied by huge volume, with respective stochastics reversing from the 40 zone, which is looking lucrative at current levels.Thus, investors and traders can enter longs in the zone of Rs 255–270 with an upside target of Rs 320 and a stop-loss of Rs 235 on a daily closing basis.KPR Mill: Buy | LTP: Rs 790 | Stop-Loss: Rs 749 | Target: Rs 860 | Return: 9 percentAfter making the top near Rs 928 on November 22, 2023, the said counter gave a decent correction until Rs 732. In the previous trading session, it bounced back from the support zone of Rs 730, coincidentally, which is between 100 and 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average), and in the process, it also took out its bearish trendline (refer to the chart), thus making it attractive at current levels.On the indicator front, daily stochastics has given a bull divergence (refer to the chart), which further confirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 780–795 with an upside target of Rs 860 and stop-loss orders would be placed on a daily closing basis around Rs 749.Maruti Suzuki India: Buy | LTP: Rs 10,187 | Stop-Loss: Rs 9,650 | Target: Rs 11,000 | Return: 8 percentAfter breaking down the psychological level of Rs 10,000 in the month of August 2023, the counter has retested Rs 10,000 again and reversed from that level, which confirms that the August 2023 breakout above Rs 10,000 was genuine. Also, volume was huge at the time of the reversal, which further confirms our bullish stance on the counter.Coincidentally, 200 DEMA, which comes around Rs 9,850, has been successfully tested (refer to the chart). On the indicator front, daily stochastics has shown a bull divergence (refer to the chart). Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 9,900–10,200 with an upside target of Rs 11,000 and stop-loss orders would be placed on a daily closing basis around Rs 9,650.Expert: Omkar Patil, technical & derivatives analyst - institutional equity at Ashika GroupTata Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 390 | Stop-Loss: Rs 370 | Target: Rs 435 | Return: 11 percentThe stock is presently trading at an all-time high, reflecting its strong momentum.

The Indian power sector has emerged as one of the top-performing sectors, with the renewables power sector experiencing the most significant growth. According to Power Minister RK Singh, India has increased its solar power capacity by approximately 35 times over the past eight years, and renewable energy capacity now constitutes around 43 percent of the total installed capacity.

In the fiscal year 2024, the government's budget allocation for the renewable sector has surged to Rs 10,222 crore from a low...

Agrawal believes that will be a multi-year trend.Follow our live Budget coverage here with expert opinions and latest news""We are also talking about building some more thermal power plants and renewables. In any case, they are roaring and have a huge cascading effect on all sorts of utility companies as well as the capex companies,"" he said.He foresees a wave of setting up of power plants with private-capex participation since there will be a demand-led power shortage. ""This will be a multi-year trend, as it's a global shortage, not only in India,"" he said, adding that power is the one thing you cannot import.With the economy growing at 7 percent, he estimated power demand to increase at 8 to 10 percent. The one number Agrawal will be closely watching this Budget will be the gross-domestic product (GDP) growth forecast.""I would look for the expected GDP numbers for the next year,"" he told Moneycontrol, adding that we should remember that this is an interim budget that ""we will have to wait for two more months to see the full picture"".Agrawal believes in the power of leadership and said that the current political leadership offers stability and has ushered in a sustainable growth momentum.Leadership mattersHe said that leadership can redefine a lot of things.Agrawal gave the example of HDFC to illustrate this. ""HDFC Bank in 1995, when they started, they had nothing. Today they are 12 percent of the total banking system. So obviously something must have gone right, the leadership must have done the right things given that opportunity,"" he said.Agrawal said that similarly Indian economy has an opportunity and the question is how the country's political leadership will harness this opportunity. He placed confidence in the current leadership to see this through.He said, ""I think the biggest excitement in India is that we have very stable leadership after 30 years of coalition government. Now this leadership has also matured in their two terms.""""So the first term was a bit challenging because a lot of changes were there. In the second term, particularly in the second half of the second term, they are getting their act together and the growth momentum is picking up. I think this momentum will be taken into the third term, and it will become far more vigorous as we go forward,"" he added.Agrawal pointed out that there is a lot of certainty round the current dispensation returning to power, and the only uncertainty is around the kind of majority they will win.""Now the issue is, in terms of number of seats, is the government going to come with an all-time high number. The chances of disruption are low. Like 0.1 percent. There is a chance because it is a democracy at the end of the day. If there is a disruption, we'll have some setback for some time, then we'll see what happens from there,"" he said and added that any disruption may cause only a pain of a year or two, not more.While the markets have been hitting new highs and there are concerns around overheated valuations, Agrawal said that there will always be pockets of opportunity.Also read: As Sensex, Nifty eye budget momentum, here’s how markets moved during Modi’s past budgets""Most of the companies will come back to their long-term averages.

However, despite the Centre’s attempts over the last four years, private sector capex has lagged in spite of healthy balance sheets, comfortable liquidity and robust profits.In a report, Nuvama Institutional Equities noted that during the first half of the current fiscal year, general government capex grew 35 percent-plus, but private capex languished below 10 percent on-year. “Besides, real rates are at decadal highs and the global capex cycle too is languishing. Thus, we are not constructive on private capex revival,” said the brokerage.Follow all the latest updates on the Interim Budget 2024 hereGovernment capex expectationsThe Union government’s capex has tripled over the past five years. Among the various sectors, it has been focusing on public infrastructure to drive capex growth.However, for Budget 2024, the growth in capex could moderate to 7-8 percent, as fiscal consolidation takes a toll, said Jefferies. Other estimates range from 7 to 15 percent.State governments have also participated in the current capex cycle. Kashyap Javeri, fund manager, Emkay Investment Managers, said, “The state government capex rose to 3.2 percent of GDP for FY24 and is likely to rise to 3.4 percent of GDP next year. To put things in perspective, the overall government capex (state plus central) which used to languish at about 2.8 percent of GDP until FY20, would more than double to around 6 percent of GDP in FY25.”Private capex lagging; spending selectivePalka Arora Chopra, director, Master Capital Services, said, “Over the last decade, private capital spending has shown sluggish growth, with the macroeconomic environment becoming increasingly uncertain due to factors such as supply chain issues, the COVID-19 pandemic and escalating inflation rates.”Some analysts disagree with the general notion of private capex lagging. Javeri said that capacity utilisation of the top five to ten players across industries like cement, steel and power is hovering around 80 percent or more.On a TTM or trailing twelve months basis, the total capex of manufacturing-related companies within the BSE500 Index stood at Rs 5.3-5.5 lakh crore, a growth of 14.5 percent over the same period last year, he added.Nevertheless, the pervasive sentiment of lacklustre private spending remains. According to experts, while publicly listed companies have ramped up their capital expenditure in the last two years, the unlisted sector—a grouping that is nearly three times larger than the listed sector—has witnessed a notable slowdown in capital spending, mirroring its weaker financial position. This dissonance is a key factor contributing to the overall downturn in corporate investments across the country.Private capex has also been selective so far, and not full-fledged, especially since private consumption has exhibited a K-shaped pattern. “Urban India and higher economic strata have heavy-lifted consumption, while the same momentum is not apparent in rural areas and lower economic strata,” said Hitesh Jain, strategist, Yes Securities.What can the government do to reinvigorate private capex? Successfully reviving private capital expenditure in India post-Budget 2024 hinges on several factors, said Sheersham Gupta, director of brokerage Rupeezy. Once election uncertainties have passed, he anticipates a positive trend in private investment. The budget's effectiveness in stimulating private investment depends on creating a favourable business environment, implementing pro-investment policies, and addressing inflation and supply-side issues.Also Read | Budget 2024: Will the government rationalise capital gains taxes?A significant emphasis on infrastructure spending is expected, which will foster a conducive environment for private sector participation through public-private partnerships. “The budget should prioritise ensuring easy credit availability, with the establishment of credit guarantee schemes to mitigate risks for banks. Regulatory reforms aimed at simplifying processes and fostering a business-friendly atmosphere should be on the agenda,” Gupta added.“The budget could include reforms in urban planning and transportation to make it easier for private sector companies to invest in these areas. Additionally, tax incentives and subsidies will encourage private sector investment in key sectors such as manufacturing, renewable energy, and technology,” said Nikunj Saraf, vice president, Choice Wealth.However, since the budget will focus on fiscal consolidation, it will not allocate the same level of resources for capital expenditure. Therefore, the government will try to prod private capex through production-linked incentives and other schemes, while pushing for state capex through interest-free loans.“Emphasis on state capex will be there, given that state capex has higher efficiency and growth multiplier impact than the centre’s capex,” said Jain.Stocks to bet onJaveri said that the capital goods and infrastructure sector will continue to reap the benefits of strong government and private capex. “This could include segments in EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) as well as products like gears, compressors, transformers and other segments as well,” he added.Some stocks on Gupta’s radar are Coal India, SRF, Aether Industries and Larsen & Toubro (L&T).Also Read | Budget 2024: Auto sector eyes EV incentives to push entry-level carsOn the other hand, Jefferies said this lower capex might disappoint the market, and stocks exposed to the government capex programme may see some correction.

""However, we continue to expect 5 cuts in 2024 and 3 more in 2025 because we expect core inflation to fall at least a couple of tenths below the FOMC's median projection this year.""Investors also seemed to be wagering that more the Fed delayed now, the more aggressive it would have to cut in the future given slowing inflation would sharply lift real rates.As a result, Fed fund futures for December have priced in a further 13 basis points of easing this year taking the total expected to 143 basis points.Likewise, Treasuries rallied strongly as 10-year yields dived 12 basis points to 3.91% in the wake of the Fed decision.

However, a reversal in its policy in March is looking increasingly unlikely, per experts.Tesla TanksA Delaware judge tossed out Elon Musk's record-breaking $56 billion Tesla pay package, calling the compensation granted by the EV maker's board ""an unfathomable sum"" that was unfair to shareholders.

The company informed exchanges that depending on the nature of the resolution, it estimates the worst-case impact at Rs 300-500 crore on its annual EBITDA.""However, the company expects to continue on its trajectory to improve its profitability,"" Paytm said.The Reserve Bank of India on January 31 imposed major business restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank. The central bank said a validation report of the external auditors revealed “persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns in the (Paytm Payments) Bank” thus forcing it to take such drastic action.Following the strict action, Paytm informed exchanges that it is ""taking immediate steps to comply with RBI directions, including working with the regulator to address their concerns as quickly as possible"".In its order against Paytm Payments Bank, RBI stated that no further deposits, credit transactions, or top-ups will be allowed in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, NCMC cards, etc. after February 29, 2024, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds that may be credited anytime.""The nodal accounts of One97 Communications and Paytm Payments Services are to be terminated at the earliest, in any case not later than February 29, 2024.

""OCL, as a payments company, works with various banks (not just Paytm Payments Bank), on various payments products. OCL started to work with other banks since starting of the embargo,"" said Paytm.Going forward, Paytm will be working only with other banks, and not with Paytm Payments Bank. The Paytm Payment Gateway business (online merchants) will continue to offer payment solutions to its existing merchants. OCL’s offline merchant payment network offerings like Paytm QR, Paytm Soundbox, Paytm Card Machine, will continue as usual, where it can onboard new offline merchants as well, the company informed.Concerning the direction on termination of nodal account of OCL and Paytm Payments Services Limited (PPSL) by February 29, 2024, OCL and PPSL will move the nodal to other banks during this period, Paytm said in a release. ""OCL’s other financial services such as loan distribution, insurance distribution and equity broking, are not in any way related to PBBL and are expected to be unaffected by this direction,"" it said.Separately, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma reconfirmed to Paytm that he has not taken any margin loans, or otherwise pledged any shares that are directly or indirectly owned by him.The fintech major also clarified that as per banking regulations, Paytm Payments Bank Limited is run independently by its management and board. ""While OCL is allowed to have two board seats on the board of Paytm Payments Bank Limited, as a part of its shareholder agreement, OCL exerts no influence on the operations of Paytm Payments Bank Limited, other than as a minority board member, and minority shareholder,"" it said.Paytm share price impactShare price of One 97 Communications (Paytm) may crash to the lower circuit on February 1 due to the RBI crackdown on Paytm Payments Bank, effectively putting an end to the firm's banking activities. Institutional investors may dump the stock over concerns that the contagion may spread to Paytm’s other key businesses. This will give a body blow to its business, say analysts and fund managers.Also Read | Paytm stock to see sharp cut as institutions may dump stock; reputational risk greater than earnings impactJayant Kharote, Equity Analyst at Jefferies India, said that Paytm’s wallet business, which is 5 percent of GMV, may need to be wound down. Also, Fastag GMV, where Paytm is the third largest player with 17 percent market share, will be majorly affected. All these customers will now likely migrate to other players in the market. ""Key impact can be on lending business (more than 20 percent of revenues) if lending partners limit business due to operational/governance risks,” he said.Fund managers and analysts are expecting a 5-15 percent earnings per share (EPS) impact. This will deepen the worry as the company has been trying hard to become profitable. There were expectations that the company would likely report breakeven on EBITDA in FY25.Some leading fund managers told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity there may be no point holding Paytm stock as the RBI move casts a long shadow on the way ahead.On January 31, Paytm shares settled marginally lower at Rs 761.00 on the National Stock Exchange. The improving business performance led to a rally in Paytm share price as buyers returned even as some pre-IPO shareholders exited the stock. The stock is up 45 percent in the last one year.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

In the previous trading session, it bounced back from 21 DEMA (day exponential moving average) and took out its bearish trendline (refer to the chart), thus making it attractive at current levels.On the indicator front, daily stochastics has given a positive crossover just around the oversold zone, which further confirms our bullish stance in the counter.Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 330–336 with an upside target of Rs 365 and stop-loss would be placed on a daily closing basis around Rs 317.UCO BankSince the last 27 trading sessions, the said counter has been steadily consolidating near 21 DEMA and 50 DEMA. In the previous trading session, it took out its previous swing high of Rs 45 and is currently placed near the Rs 47 mark.One can buy in the zone of Rs 45–47 for an upside target of Rs 55 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 42 on a daily close basis.Tata MotorsAt the current juncture, the said counter looks extremely overbought on a monthly scale. Also, the previous 3–4 months have exceptionally gone well.

The FOMC, which takes decision over fund rates in the US, unanimously voted to keep the rates steady for the fourth straight time. Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, also refused to say when a rate cut was expected. However, he added that it was unlikely in March meeting.Veteran fund manager and co-founder of Pinetree Macro, Ritesh Jain, told Moneycontrol that if the FOMC fails to find an opportunity to cut rates in the next couple of meetings, then it will find it hard to start the cycle. He also expects the US  10-year yield to rise back above 4 percent again.Edited excerpt:Was the FOMC decision on expected lines? What is your reading of the statement?The statement is on expected lines. The tightening bias is gone in this statement but they have tempered the market expectation of easing.

A possible reduction in GST rates and an extension of schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana could incentivise growth for the sector.""We expect a robust government initiative to bolster local manufacturing of electronic products. Industry players are advocating for a reduction in GST on essential appliances from 12 percent to 5 percent,” Axis Securities said in a pre-budget report.GST, Slashing Import DutyReducing the current import duty on important components such as semiconductors and compressors (used in washing machines, air conditioners, and refrigerators) could make production cheaper and drive down prices for consumers. ""This could lead to a 15-20 percent increase in sales, impacting the sector by Rs. 10,000-15,000 crore,” said Balasubramanian A, Vice President, TeamLease Services.""For example, reducing import duties for washing machine components to 10 percent from 20 percent could bring down production costs by 5 percent"".Industry experts suggest that the government ought to support consumption. In line with the strong GST trend, it is anticipated that the government could reduce the GST on LED TVs larger than 32 inches to 18 percent in Budget 2024. Further, PLI schemes must be expanded to include smart TVs, refrigerators, and washing machines.""As a seller, I would certainly want a reduction in GST, Nilesh Gupta, managing director of Vijay Sales, told Moneycontrol. It must be noted that while the decision to cut rates can only be taken by the GST Council, the Finance Minister can make such a proposal in the Budget.PLI schemes, renewable energy to aid growth""A continued emphasis on existing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which witnessed a 66 percent growth to Rs 79,000 crore in the FY23 budget, is anticipated to further enhance the housing and housing products segment,” said analysts at Axis Securities.Follow LIVE Updates of the Interim BudgetUnder the new Pradhan Mantri Suryodaya Yojana, the government aims to install rooftop solar power systems in 10 million households in India. While it had launched the Rooftop Solar Programme in 2014 with a target solar installation of 40GW by FY22, it could achieve only 11GW by FY22 due to several constraints including high dependence on imports and inadequate awareness among households.""With increased domestic manufacturing and fresh impetus from the state, we believe the scenario appears promising for solar panel manufacturing companies and electrical companies over the next 3 years,” JM Financial said in a report.Focus on ‘Make in India’""The government must prioritise research and development and streamline the supply chain.

However, analysts are of the view that most headwinds are now seemingly behind and consumer durables demand is said to revive and remain constructive in the sector over the medium-long term.HDFC Securities believes that there is a long runway for growth amid resilient housing demand, and rising consumer aspiration-backed premiumization trends.

However, policy intent is likely to be made clear through the selective allocation of resources and thrust towards rural development, employment generation and capacity building through infrastructure development.The critical intent of this Budget will be to signal a consolidation towards achieving the promised 4.5 percent GFD (gross fiscal deficit)/GDP (gross domestic product) by FY26. Thus, the government will have to do a tightrope walk in allocating resources for capital expenditure while the committed expenditures on the revenue side remain large.Note that nearly a fourth of the total expenditures is cornered by interest payments (19 percent in FY21), which also accounts for nearly 3.6 percent of the GDP. And let us not forget about the pressures that get created on the subsidy bill, especially with the volatility in crude prices, and to meet the requirements of excess demand for work under the MNREGS. FY24 has seen additional allocations for MNREGS under the first supplementary grant over the Rs 60,000 crore allocated under the Budget. And more may be needed through the next round of supplementary grants.Nominal GDP growth of 10.5% may be assumed in FY25 BudgetThe government, however, is unlikely to be able to immediately withdraw from capital expenditure in a significant way as private consumption demand continues to remain on the weaker side while private capital expenditure lags despite good balance sheets of corporates and banks. No doubt the macro setting is good to allow for the Budget to prevent any sharp increase in capex as in the previous years.Growth in FY24 is estimated at 7.3 percent (a stellar performance when compared to the growth dynamics in the rest of the world and coming after a 7.2 percent GDP growth in the previous fiscal). The other big achievement is the RBI engineering a drop in the core retail inflation. Even though there may be some pockets of softness in the economy, such as the consumption expenditure, a weak rural sector, and a lagging private capex, there may not be any immediate requirements of a fiscal push to correct for these.Follow live coverage on Interim Budget hereOn the other hand, credible guidance for fiscal consolidation is likely in order, especially considering the government promising a 4.5 percent GFD/GDP by FY26. First, credibility towards consolidation is necessary as India gets included in a global bond index and investors would be critically looking at the macro strengths and the weaknesses of the economy before making their investment decisions. Second, the global atmosphere is still fraught with significant risks (geopolitical, climate, financial) and only time will tell if the fiscal space needs to be used once more as was during the Covid period.At a strategic level, the public debt/GDP ratio is high at 84 percent and needs to be brought down and so is the interest payment bill which is essentially a wasteful expenditure. Thus, space needs to be created once again on the fiscal side, to fight any further eventualities, and to remain guarded against commodity price shocks due to supply concerns on account of geopolitical issues.Click Here To Read All Budget NewsRecent experience shows that the government has slowed its capital expenditure and along with better tax collection can effectively mask higher revenue outgoes during FY24. Our calculations show that the government can attain a GFD/GDP target of 5.8 percent for FY24 against the Budget target of 5.9 percent, and guide for a 5.3-5.4 percent GFD/GDP for FY25. With this correction and armed with a robust small savings collection, the government will likely be able to contain its borrowing programme to a comfortable level.Our mathematics indicates net borrowings through G-secs at Rs 11.7 lakh crore, almost unchanged from FY24. Gross borrowings through G-secs are estimated at Rs 15 lakh crore with Rs 3.3 lakh crore redemption (FY24 at Rs 15.4 lakh crore). For states, we assume a GSFD/GSDP of 2.8 percent of which 60 percent is expected to be met by net SDL (state development loans) of Rs 5.5 lakh crore. Gross SDL issuances are placed at Rs 8.7 lakh crore. Cumulative government borrowings are thus anticipated at Rs 23.7 lakh crore in FY25 (Rs 24.9 lakh crore in FY24).With bond inclusion scheduled for June 2024, we do not see the issuance size creating any negative impact on the market while we keep an eye on RBI’s OMO (open market operations) sales that may be needed to counter likely FX purchases of the estimated $20-22 billion inclusion-related flows. We see the 10-year yield at 6.75-7.10 percent in FY25 with the journey to the sub-7 percent zone conditional on the timing of the rate cut by the RBI.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

NTPC (CMP: Rs 318)According to the Central Electricity Authority, India's peak power demand will cross the 260 GW mark in 2025-26 and hit 277 GW by 2026-27.

National Fertiliser (CMP: Rs 126.5)The Union Budget is likely to look at an allocation lower than Rs 1.75 lakh crore for fertiliser subsidy in 2024-25 owing to a drop in international prices, government push towards schemes for use of bio and organic fertilisers and increased use of nano urea, a government official told Moneycontrol.In the current fiscal year (2023-24), the fertiliser subsidy is likely to touch Rs 1.88 lakh crore.Lower allocation could be a dampener for fertiliser stocks, though the general sentiment is that government will be proactive in supporting farmer by providing food and fertiliser subsidies.Union Budget 2024: What to expect for railway sector13 and 14. RVNL (CMP: Rs 309.25), IRCON (CMP: Rs 237.9)CareEdge Ratings anticipates a budgetary allocation of around Rs 3 lakh crore for the railway sector in Union Budget 2024-25, reflecting a 25 percent increase from the previous year.This will advance Vande Bharat trains, station redevelopment, and new tracks, contributing to a bull run in railway stocks. Both RVNL and IRCON have gained over 300 percent in the past one year but further rally is expected on incremental order wins, as per analysts. RVNL has a strong order book of over Rs 70,000 crore and IRCON has an order book of Rs 30,000 crore.15. UltraTech Cement (CMP: Rs 10,145)Housing and infrastructure projects constitute over 80 percent of India's cement demand.

Some feel it will burden shareholders, while others feel it benefits both the company and the shareholder when compared to the outgo on account of tax on dividends. It remains to be seen how the Finance Minister tinkers with these taxes in the upcoming Union Budget","Buyback taxation has always remained a contentious issue and several tax experts are of the view that shifting tax incidence from the listed company to the hands of shareholders would be fair and impartial. This would also bring buyback tax at par with dividend tax, they said.Tune in to Moneycontrol for live budget coverage.Currently, under Section 115QA of the Income Tax Act, the company is liable to pay tax at a flat rate of 23.3 percent on distributed income. Distributed income is essentially the difference between the amount the company pays to purchase the shares and the amount it received when the shares were first issued. Budget and Markets: Will the FM spook the F&O party by hiking securities transaction tax?Meanwhile, shareholders whose shares are accepted in a buyback are not liable to pay any tax, a move aimed at avoiding double taxation.On the other hand, when it comes to dividends, shareholders pay the tax and the company does not. Earlier, companies used to pay Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) but the Finance Act 2020 abolished it.So, what is the contention?Vijay Gilda, Partner, Tax and Regulatory Services, BDO India, explained that in the case of dividends, all shareholders are remunerated while in a buyback, there is no surety that all the shareholders who tender shares will receive proceeds. ""In that sense, on account of buyback tax being paid by the company, there is a value erosion for those shareholders who don't participate or don't get their shares accepted in a buyback,"" said Gilda.To this, Amit Gupta of Saraf and Partners added, ""The company pays the buyback tax from its reserves, which is a common kitty for all shareholders. Essentially, shareholders who do not participate in a buyback, end up bearing the tax burden for the shareholders who exit through the buyback route.""Expect some housing incentives in Budget, prefer private over PSU banks: Macquarie’s Suresh GanapathyIn 2019, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had also noted in a consultation paper that tax treatment is not equitable in case of buybacks, more so, in the case of open market buybacks.Under the open market route, there is a possibility of the entire sell order of any shareholder of the listed entity, getting matched with the purchase order placed by the company. ""This is irrespective of the fact if the said selling shareholder intended to offer his/her shares to the company pursuing its buyback on the exchange,"" said Sebi.On the other hand, if a shareholder is willing to sell shares but his/her order does not match with the company's buy order, then it becomes a normal market transaction and the seller will end up paying capital gains tax. This is one of the reasons why Sebi wants to phase out open market buybacks. RBI deals body blow to Paytm with crippling restrictions on its payments bankPromoters' misuse?To be sure, when buyback tax was extended to listed companies in July 2019 (earlier it was only for unlisted companies), there was a dip in the number and quantum of buybacks. However, this trend quickly reversed.Gupta explained that for the promoters there is an inclination for buybacks over normal dividend distribution by virtue of considerable tax arbitrage, approximately 12 percent, as per the extant tax regime.As per SEBI guidelines, only 15 percent of the buyback has to be reserved for retail investors. So, promoters and high-networth individuals have a better chance of getting their shares accepted and thus, get the tax benefit.Pranav Sayta of EY breaks down the math behind tax arbitrage:Suppose, a company has Rs 123 cash available to be distributed to shareholders. Option A, the company goes for a dividend. Assuming the highest tax slab of 35.88 percent, cash that finally reaches shareholders is Rs 80.Option B, buyback. Company distributes Rs 100 via buyback. Shareholders get the entire Rs 100 and company pays Rs 23.3 as buyback tax. So, effective tax is 18.9 percent (Rs 23.3 of Rs 123, which is company's total outgo) Budget 2024 | Do's and Dont's for traders to protect from big losses on Budget dayWhat if tax goes to the shareholders' hands?Prior to the introduction of buyback tax on the company, shareholders were paying capital gains tax if their shares were accepted in a buyback. Even if that practice is brought back, the shareholders would not be disadvantaged in a big manner, said Gupta.""Long terms capital gain are taxed at special rates, viz. 10 percent and not as per the higher tax slab based rates for dividend income,"" he said.Further, Gilda added that it brings parity between incidence of tax on dividend and buybacks, and any burden of tax on gains does not fall on all the shareholders.It remains to be seen how the Finance Minister tinkers with these taxes, and one can only hope that there are no negative surprises."

However, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the index is down 5.07 percent. Some signs of short covering were seen on the day before the presentation of the budget.","A day before the presentation of the interim budget, Nifty gained more than 213 points, and BSE Sensex strengthened by 612 points. Banks and financial services stocks saw some short covering, which lifted the key benchmark indices. With a 35-point contribution, HDFC Bank added the most to the Nifty gains. Put together, private banks, viz., HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Axis Bank, contributed 63 points, or 30 percent, to Nifty gains. With the interim budget set to be announced, traders and investors will be planning their best strategies to deal with the markets on an eventful day.Tune in to Moneycontrol for live budget coverage.How to position your trades on budget day?According to Sriram Velayudhan, Senior Vice President, Alternative Research, at IIFL Securities, “Since it is an interim budget, not much hedging activity is seen in the market. It's reflected in the implied volatility as well. Implied volatility is currently not pricing in any uncertainty. The case would have been different had it been a full-fledged budget.The market will surely look for cues on capital spending, likely reforms, etc. on budget day (February 1). However, the FOMC meeting details and the commentary will set the agenda for investors and traders. As of now, I see short positions being built into financials. If any positive development happens in this space, we could see decent short covering in financials. On a net basis, I do not see any big moves on this budget day. The range I am looking at is 21,000 to 21,800 in Nifty for the February series. For traders, it is always prudent to hedge long positions ahead of the event.”The Nifty Private Bank index is up 2.09 percent in the past week. However, on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, the index is down by 5.07 percent. Some signs of short-covering were already seen a day before the interim budget.*Blue bars indicate calls open interest change. Purple bars indicate puts open interest change.The market is expected to be volatile on February 1, not only because of the interim budget but also because of the earnings that will be announced that day. At least 88 companies are expected to announce their quarterly results on budget day, as per the BSE website. Adani Ports, Adani Enterprises, Arvind Smartspaces, TD Power Systems, Jupiter Wagons, Texmaco Rail, Indian Hotels, Pricol, and Titan are some of the companies that will declare results, adding to the overall volatility of the markets.Sneha Poddar, AVP - Retail Research, Broking and Distribution, MOFSL, said, ""Since the budget is (coinciding) with the US Fed outcome, we expect the market to see some volatility. Due to the upcoming general elections, we may see some populist schemes being included in the Interim Budget 2024-25, while they may also look at providing some relief on the personal income tax front.”Strategy to beat the volatility on budget dayWith higher volatility come bigger opportunities for strategy traders. Rajesh Palviya, SVP - Technical and Derivatives Research, Axis Securities, suggests, “Strategy traders can opt for budget day/weekly expiry (known as) (REPHRASED. IS IT OK?) Iron Butterfly. The strategy involves selling one lot of Nifty 21,550 Call at 151 and selling one lot of Nifty 21,550 Put at 155 while simultaneously buying one lot of 21,900 Call at 32 and buying one lot of 21,200 Put at 46. Both risk and reward in this strategy are limited, and the gains in the strategy at expiry will accrue between two levels, that is, 21,800 on the upside and 21,300 on the downside. A maximum profit of Rs 11,400 can happen if Nifty closes/expires at 21,550. On the other hand, if Nifty on expiry closes above 21,778 (upper BEP) or below 21,322 (lower BEP), then the strategy will start making a loss. The maximum loss will be limited to Rs 6,100 for any close above 21,900 or below 21,200.”*Blue bars indicate calls open interest change. Purple bars indicate puts open interest changeSheersham Gupta, Director and Senior Technical Analyst at Rupeezy advises traders not to create aggressive positions. He suggests, “Market volatility tends to surge in the lead-up to the budget, and it is almost certain to crash post-budget."" So one can look to create non-directional option writing strategies like short strangles. As the implied volatility falls, so will the option premiums. Contracts with a June or December expiry date will have higher premiums; so the fall in premiums will be greater in these series. So, a position created in far-month series contracts will give better profits.The strike price selected for the short strangles should be far from At-The-Money (ATM) as they have more cushion to accommodate a steep rise or fall in the markets. So on the upside 24,000 and on the downside 20,000 can be chosen as the strike prices for the strategy. It should be noted that these strategies will require constant monitoring and adjustments.”Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This will give a body blow to its business, say analysts and fund managers.The central bank said a validation report of the external auditors revealed “persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns in the (Paytm Payments) Bank” thus forcing it to take such drastic action.Customer leakage; users to shift to other banksThe RBI action follows the regulator’s earlier directive barring onboarding of new customers to Paytm Payments Bank platform. RBI had issues with the bank for non-compliance on doing full know your customer (KYC) of customers, not doing full KYC of accounts older than one year, and keeping more money than allowed by the regulator in a payment bank account.Since no customer will be able to deposit money in their account and only be able to withdraw, they will be forced to shift to other banks. In the process of transitioning customers to other banks, Paytm may lose customers. This will hurt the topline and the bottomline of the consolidated business, however, not significantly.Jayant Kharote, Equity Analyst at Jefferies India, said that Paytm’s wallet business, which is 5 percent of GMV, may need to be wound down. Also, Fastag GMV, where Paytm is the third largest player with 17 percent market share, will be majorly affected. All these customers will now likely migrate to other players in the market.Reputation loss to hit key lending businessWhat is more worrisome for Paytm is the reputational risk, which may make its partners wary of doing business with the fintech giant. “Key impact can be on lending business (more than 20 percent of revenues) if lending partners limit business due to operational/governance risks,” said Kharote.Though clarity on the issue is yet to emerge, the impact on lending business, if any, will likely be minimal, fund managers believe.However, for investors’ sentiment, this is bad news especially after the company had started cutting down on low ticket loans (less than Rs 50,000), which are usually availed by small merchants.EPS cut likelyAll-in-all, fund managers and analysts are expecting a 5-15 percent earnings per share (EPS) impact. This will deepen the worry as the company has been going extra lengths to become profitable. There were expectations that the company would likely report breakeven on EBITDA in FY25.In the nine months ended December 2024, Paytm reported a loss of Rs 14 per share, merely half of losses sustained in the same period, previous fiscal.The improving business performance led to a rally in Paytm share price as buyers returned even as some pre-IPO shareholders exited the stock. The stock is up 19 percent in the last one month and 43 percent in the last one year.Now, some leading fund managers told Moneycontrol on condition of anonymity that they will ‘wait and watch’. Some others said that there may be no point holding the stock as the RBI move casts a long shadow on the way ahead. Besides, it was highly unlikely for any institution or strategic player to buy big blocks to support the stock considering the threat to business and lack of visibility.The company management was huddled in a meeting and analysts and managers were waiting to hear from the company’s response with specifics on the possible extent of business loss, and strategy going ahead."

As alcohol is a state-owned subject, no major announcements in excise duties are expected. However, some relaxation on the commodity side can be expected, say experts.Some announcements on the easing of extra neutral alcohol (ENA) costs are expected, said Ajay Thakur, lead analyst for consumer staples at Anand Rathi. ENA, a raw material, makes up almost 40 percent of the total costs in alco-beverage companies. ENA is nothing but the purest form of ethanol. ENA costs have been high for over a year now due to an uptick in the cost of grains such as barley, maize, and sugarcane.Prices of barley and wheat are still inflationary, and the government might undertake some initiatives to bring down agri-commodity prices in the Interim Budget, said Karan Taurani, Senior Vice President at Elara Securities. ""Announcements in terms of farmer incentives might help in lowering agricultural commodity prices,"" he said.Stay tuned with Moneycontrol's LIVE blog on Budget 2024Taurani also said that announcements on delaying the 20 percent ethanol blending target for FY25 can also help the alco-beverage industry. Currently, 10 percent of ethanol is blended with petrol. The government increased this to blending 20 percent ethanol with petrol and wants it to be followed from 2025. ENA costs might inch up further if more ethanol goes for blending and so alco-beverage companies want the FY25 deadline to be postponed.Stocks likely to move as a result of these announcements are United Spirits, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan.The overall alcohol industry will report revenue numbers similar to FY24 in FY25 due to input price inflation and no further price hikes, said Taurani.Premium category alcohol is expected to grow faster compared to the regular category in FY25, say experts. ""Prestige and Above (PA) category will see a double-digit revenue growth in FY25 and medium-to-high single digit volume growth in the same period,"" said Thakur. However, revenues from the regular category will continue to decline.""We expect premiumisation to aid growth as consumer preferences are shifting to better quality liquor. We expect the trend of uptrading from regular to PA as a structural and sustainable trend and aid overall growth for the sector,"" said B&K Securities in a report on the sector.CigarettesNo incremental announcements on cigarettes are expected in the Interim Budget, experts Moneycontrol spoke to said.""The government will most likely not increase taxes on cigarettes because it lowers their revenue,"" said Preeyam Toila, Equity Research Analyst at Axis Securities. He also said that the National Calamity Contingent Duty (NCCD), a type of tax on cigarettes was revised last year so any new tax changes this year are unlikely. NCCD on specific cigarettes was raised by 16 percent in the last budget.Increasing taxes on cigarettes is also aimed at trying to lower consumption. However, experts say it does not reduce cigarette consumption, and sometimes leads to some people shifting to cheaper alternatives like bidis and chewing tobacco. Plus, the government loses revenues from organised players.Between FY13-17, excise duty on cigarettes grew at a CAGR of 15.7 percent, while the taxes remained stable during FY18-20. ITC wrote in its annual report that during FY13-17, the government's tax revenues increased by only 4.7 percent. Tax revenue collections grew 10.2 percent during the period of stable cigarette taxes.Stocks which could likely move from any announcements in the sector are ITC, VST Industries and Godfrey Phillips.In cigarettes, volumes and revenues are expected to grow slower in FY25 because of a high base, said Toila. After the pandemic, cigarette volumes and revenue increased due to high out-of-home consumption, creating a high base. People returning to offices contributed to the noticeable increase in cigarette sales during the same period. Also, the trend of organised cigarette players clawing back market share from illicit players will continue in FY25, said experts.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, it is not clear how marginal farmers will benefit from it. Hence some announcements specifically benefiting the marginal are also expected.Tune in to Moneycontrol for live budget coverage.Some analysts are of the view that the money transferred under the government’s flagship direct benefit transfer scheme — Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi — will increase by 50 percent to Rs 9000 per year.The agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2023-24 saw a total allocation of Rs 1.25 lakh crore or a 2.78 percent share. This share was 3.36 percent in the 2022-23 Union Budget and 3.78 percent in the year before that. This shows a declining trend in percentage allocation to the agriculture sector.When it comes to promoting natural farming some budget allocation on research and development is desired by the industry.Says Satyajit Hange, Co-Founding Farmer, Two Brother Organic Farms, “Organic farmers anticipate that the budget will prioritise sustainable agriculture, offer incentives for organic certification, allocate funds for organic research, and support market access for organic products, while addressing environmental and biodiversity concerns.”With an aim to produce chemical and fertiliser-free food grains and other crops, the promotion of natural farming started in the Union budget 2022-23. It is widely believed that organic farming and natural farming help to reduce environmental pollution and improve soil health.According to the Economics Survey 2023-24, during 2021-22 around 59.1 lakh hector areas were cultivated under organic farming. A substantial push from the government side is required in terms of awareness and incentives if the gross area cultivated under organic farming is to be increased, experts believe.Neetika Suryawanshi, CFO, Pakka Ltd (a regenerative agri-abased solutions providing company), comments “Government support, encompassing infrastructure development, tax incentives, and funding for research & development, is crucial. Substantial investments in R&D are imperative to enhance technical skills, meet stringent quality standards, and broaden capabilities across diverse sectors.”The industry expects the government to allocate some funds on R&D and spread awareness of natural farming.According to the recent report by Jefferies on ITC, agri revenues declined 2 percent year-on-year (YoY) due to restrictions on agri exports. this was the case with other firms as well dealing in agri-commodities. Agriculture sector stocks on average delivered 33.49 percent returns since February 1, 2022.At least three stocks from the agriculture sector have managed to more than double.

Given that 2024 is an election year, the Vote on Account or Interim Budget would merely be an interim approval to spend money, without any major tax or policy changes expected.However, the significance of this budget should not be understated as it provides an opportunity for the government to underscore economic accomplishments in the lead-up to the 2024 general elections.

This momentum is predicted to stay on in 2024, said analysts, with expectations of increased allocation and continued investment in safety enhancements, asset replacement, and ambitious projects such as the bullet train.As per rating agency CareEdge Ratings forecast, the Railways is likely to bag a budgetary allocation of around Rs 3 lakh crore in the Union Budget 2024-25, reflecting a 25 percent increase from the previous year.Stocks to watch: Rail Vikas Nigam (RVNL), Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), Ircon International, NBCC (India), RailTel Corporation of India and Texmaco Rail & Engineering.Budget 2024-25: Railway stocks on a bull ride as analysts predict higher allocation of capital#2 Govt's infra thrust is expected to continueAnalysts expect the interim budget to prioritise rural and urban connectivity, railways, ports, aviation and highways for their significant impact on growth and employment. ""With a potential increase in capital allocation, these sectors are anticipated to serve as India's growth engine in the upcoming years, enhancing the overall quality of life,"" said analysts at Tej Mandi.In the Union Budget 2023-24, the finance minister allocated around Rs 10 lakh crore for infrastructure capital expenditure, a 33 percent increase from the previous year. For 2024-25 fiscal, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways requested a budgetary allocation of Rs 3.25 lakh crore, marking a 25 percent YoY increase.Stocks to watch: KNR Constructions, PNC Infratech, RITES, KEC International, and PSP Projects. In the cement sector, Ambuja Cement, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat Ltd, JK Cement, and JK Lakshmi are likely to be in focus.Budget 2024: Anticipating growth in India's infrastructure landscape#3 India's 'self-reliance' theme to gain focus; Defence to benefitThe government's focus on making India self-reliant and a global export hub in the long term will continue this Interim Budget. Analysts believe investments in the defence side will continue, with increases in capex spending to be seen more in FY25.In the FY23-24 budget, the government allocated around 68 percent to the defence industry to promote self-reliance and reduce import dependency. Around 25 percent of the defence R&D budget was earmarked for private players and startups.Stocks to watch: Hindustan Aeronautics, Data Patterns, Bharat Electronics, and Bharat Dynamics.#4 Power focus - Renewable energy transition to play bigThe power sector is likely to gain additional attention momentum in the Interim Budget as the government places expansion of renewable energy as the top priority. Analysts expect a higher capex outlay is likely to be announced for renewable energy, incentives for green initiatives, and production-linked incentives (PLIs) for solar module manufacturing.In the FY24 budget, the power segment received a 58 percent increase in allocation to Rs 20,671 crore compared to the previous fiscal. Analysts at Jefferies in an earlier note believe that power capex should grow 9x at a CAGR of 20 percent during FY23-26, up from 2.2 percent during FY10-20.Stocks to watch: NHPC, NTPC, SJVN, Power Grid, Tata Power, and Adani Power#5 Budget before elections will aim to bolster income; consumption flavour to play outAs the Interim Budget is expected to be a populist one, the government will attempt to boost disposable income in the hands of citizens, which thereby will boost spending. One way of doing this would be by increasing farm income through a minimum support price (MSP) hike, said market experts.Additionally, the likely focus on rural development and social schemes, farm credit, PM Awas Yojana (affordable housing), food security, and higher allocation to MGNREGA can also increase rural income.Stocks to watch: HUL, ITC, Avenue Supermarts, Tata Consumer Products, Marico and Britannia, among others.#6 Dinvestments to be tempered; capex programme to favour PSUsThe public sector unit (PSU) pack's future will be determined by the Interim Budget, given the government’s capex allocation for each pocket, said analysts. With divestment proceeds likely to be tempered this budget to avoid any disturbance to fiscal math, analysts believe PSUs will dominate the Street flavour as their efficiencies have improved.According to analysts at rating agency ICRA, the government is likely to keep disinvestment proceeds below Rs 50,000 crore in this interim budget. In the current fiscal, the government mopped up around Rs 10,000 crore from PSU disinvestments, substantially below the targeted Rs 51,000 crore.Stocks to watch: Concor, IDBI Bank, BPCL, and Shipping Corporation of India.#7 Rural pitch to continue - focus on 'bottom of the pyramid' Analysts believe policies related to social safety, net to bottom of pyramid, including comprehensive insurance coverage and support for women will be laid out this interim budget.""We expect policies oriented towards the upliftment of ‘bottom of the pyramid’, which are aimed at reducing out-of-pocket expenditure on necessities and emergencies,"" said analysts at Nirmal Bang.The brokerage firm also expects measures towards women’s empowerment through employment generation schemes and economic safety nets.Stocks to watch: Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, Coromandel International, GNCF, Escorts Kubota, Bayer CropScience, and UPL#8 Big emphasis on manufacturing, green & clean technologyThe budget could increase the domestic manufacturing base, which would involve tweaking existing production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes or bringing new sectors under its ambit.""Clean and green technologies and the surrounding ecosystem are likely to remain in focus. Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicle (FAME) subsidies are likely to continue with some rationalisation,"" said analysts at Nirmal Bang.Stocks to watch: Exide Industries, Bajaj Auto, Fiem Industries, Tata Motors, and TVS Motor#9 Support for SMEs and digital inclusivity roadmap for financial sectorAnalysts expect the Interim Budget to support Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and stay on a fiscal consolidation path. ""We're expecting the budget to acknowledge and encourage fintech's role in helping small businesses with the goal to create a friendly environment for businesses in India's changing economy,"" said Rajesh Sharma, Managing Director at Capri Global Capital.Apart from that they also expect a boost in digital inclusivity, with banks and NBFCs leading the charge in using technology for positive change.""In our optimistic outlook, we believe that this budget not only foresees positive strides for the financial sector but also serves as a testament to the nation's readiness to embrace change as a catalyst for sustained economic growth,"" Sharma added.Stocks to watch: Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Paytm, and PB Fintech#10 Focus on real estate and housingAnalysts at Phillip Capital anticipate the government to announce SOPs for the middle class in this interim budget, be it the promotion of a new income tax regime or housing. In this case, real estate and housing will be direct beneficiaries.The real estate upcycle can have a multiplier effect on the economy and the government's allocation of additional funds for affordable housing could bode the sector well.""In the coming budget, the governing agencies should look into giving the real estate the industry status which is long due alongside mulling over single window clearance, tax breaks, and GST rationalisation. This would not just be beneficial for the realty industry but the positive impacts will cascade into other related industries,"" said LC Mittal, Director, Motia Group.Stocks to watch: Godrej Properties, Oberoi Realty, DLF, DB Realty, and Brigade EnterprisesDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This also includes prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, and NCMC cards, among others","The Reserve Bank of India's directive effectively ending Paytm Payments Bank operations could be a key risk to the earnings and valuation of the parent firm One97 Communications, said foreign broking firm Jefferies. This is because higher margin products like wallets and FASTag, which were dependent on the payments bank entity, will now have to be wound down.""For all practical purposes, RBI action ends the operations of Paytm Payments Bank,"" said Bernstein in a note to investors. However, Bernstein expects no immediate impact to One97 Communications' UPI Payment business that accounts for 70 percent of GMV (gross merchandise value).The central bank on January 31 said that Paytm Payments Bank will not be allowed to accept fresh deposits, undertake credit transactions, or top-ups in any customer accounts. This also includes prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, and NCMC cards, among others.Also Read: RBI deals body blow to Paytm with crippling restrictions on its payments bank""This is a definite negative development and adds to the already heavy regulatory overhang on the business,"" said Bernstein.According to Jefferies, a potential key impact of RBI's move can be on lending business, over 20 percent of revenue, if lending partners limit business due to operational and governance risks. Bernstein differs here as it sees no impact to lending business.Wallets, which forms 5 percent of GMV, may need to be wound down and Fastag GMV where Paytm is the third largest player with 5.8 crore customers will also be majorly affected, noted Jefferies. GMV stands for gross merchandise value.""While the management has not indicated the contribution from these segments, we estimate that these segments would be sub-10 percent of segments' revenue and 5 percent overall revenues,"" Jefferies noted.Also Read: RBI action on Paytm Payments Bank: Key details you must be aware ofFurther clarity awaitedRBI has also said that the nodal accounts of One97 Communications and Paytm Payments Services are to be terminated at the earliest, in any case not later than February 29, 2024.""Potential impact will depend whether the restriction is on either (1) Nodal account of One97 with Paytm Payments Bank or (2) all Nodal accounts of One97. The former will have marginal impact on business, whereas the latter can have material impact,"" Jefferies said.Investors and analysts now keenly await Paytm managing director Vijay Shekhar Sharma's statement on RBI's restrictions. To be sure, when RBI had banned Paytm Payments Bank from onboarding new customers back in 2022, Sharma had said that the entity operates at an 'arm's length' from One97 Communications.Stock movementThe stock gained close to 60 percent last calendar year till November, but then saw a sharp fall when RBI cautioned against rising unsecured consumer loans in the system. Soon after, Paytm also announced that it will be scaling down its small-ticket loans, a flagship feature used by several merchants on the platform.It currently trades at ~3.9 times its book value, and the company has not turned profitable yet.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It is on track for a 1.58% gain this month.Investors are also focused on Friday's US jobs report for January, which is expected to show that employers added 180,000 jobs during the month.The ADP National Employment Report showed on Wednesday that private payrolls increased by 107,000 jobs last month, less than economists' expectations of 145,000 jobs.The dollar fell 0.71% to 146.61 yen. The Japanese currency has weakened due to the wide gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates.The greenback is on track for a 4.1% monthly gain against the yen, the largest since February last year, as weak wage data and cooling inflation leave room for the Bank of Japan to take its time raising rates.Bank of Japan policymakers discussed in January the likelihood of a near-term exit from negative interest rates and scenarios for phasing out the bank's massive stimulus program, a summary of opinions at the meeting showed on Wednesday.The summary highlights a growing view within the board that conditions were falling in place to soon pull short-term interest rates out of negative territory, which would be Japan's first interest rate hike since 2007.The euro gained 0.28% to $1.08740.German inflation eased slightly more than expected in January to 3.1%, preliminary data from the federal statistics office showed on Wednesday, helped by a drop in energy prices.Sterling rose 0.31% to $1.27420 before the Bank of England's policy announcement on Thursday, where rates are also set to be unchanged.In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin fell 1.52% to $42,889."

All these stocks have surged between 20-40 percent over the last one year.Cement demand surged post-COVID recovery, driven by government spending and housing revival, leading to higher sales and prices in FY2024. Margins are set to rise as input costs have fallen for both the December quarter and the full year, analysts said.For the year ahead, cement firms are expecting a combination of strong demand and benign input costs to drive profitability. Analysts are pencilling in a 300-350 bps expansion in operating margins to 16.5-18.5 percent as prices of two key raw materials — pet coke and coal — have cooled down significantly.Also Read: 15 budget-sensitive stocks to watch todayAt the same time, there are concerns about potential oversupply, given the industry's capacity addition of 119 mtpa in the last five years, reaching 595 mtpa. Another 150-160 mtpa is expected in the next five years, of which 35-40 mt will be in this fiscal itself.Continued government emphasis on infrastructure and housing incentives in the Interim Budget could have a multiplier effect, particularly on cement. Analysts stress that the impact relies heavily on demand from affordable housing, which exhibited a soft trend in the past two to three quarters.""Amidst robust infrastructure development, we anticipate strong cement demand, spurred by budget increases in housing, roads, railways, and rural projects, and further boosted by initiatives like PMA,” said Arun Shukla, President and Director, JK Lakshmi Cement.Cement makers are hoping that the government will take steps to address rising input costs through lower GST rates and easing import duties on key materials like coal and petcoke.Budget expectationsStakeholders eagerly await the FY25 target for government capital spending, a key driver of economic growth. PM Modi, at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit, outlined a vision for robust infrastructure growth, signaling potential policies and incentives in the Interim Budget 2024. Analysts suggest these measures could spur substantial development in the infrastructure sector.Recently, Moneycontrol reported a Ministry request for a Rs 3.25 lakh crore budgetary allocation for FY 2024-25, a 25 percent YoY increase, aiming to reduce market borrowings for the National Highways Authority of India. In the FY24 budget, the finance minister allocated Rs 10 lakh crore for infrastructure capital expenditure, a 33 percent increase. The industry expects heightened government focus on safety and timely infrastructure upgrades.Also Read: Consumer durable industry wants GST reduction, Infra push, PLI extension this interim budgetAnalysts anticipate a potential boost in budget allocations for housing and infrastructure projects, constituting over 80 percent of India's cement demand. Schemes targeting rural economic revival are expected to drive demand for rural housing. Key points to watch include changes in freight rates and announcements regarding new freight corridors.""We look forward to witnessing measures aligning with India's growth trajectory, particularly in infrastructure development and affordable housing. An emphasis on maintaining competitive prices for raw materials and energy sources will significantly boost the Indian cement sector. We also remain hopeful of receiving sustained support through fiscal incentives and streamlined freight mechanisms, essential for thrusting the cement industry forward. Additionally, a user-friendly and incentivised renewable energy policy will play a critical role in fostering sustainable growth"", said Jayakumar Krishnaswamy, Managing Director, Nuvoco Vistas Corp.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty is broadly trading within the range of 21100 – 21800 since the past nine trading sessions. The Nifty has been trading in a volatile manner within this broad range. The momentum setup is providing a divergent signal as both daily and hourly momentum indicators have a negative crossover but prices are moving higher. Under such a situation when the price and momentum indicator are not in sync it generally leads to a range bound move. Considering the event of interim budget volatility is likely to continue. Key support levels are 21550 – 21500 while immediate hurdle zone is placed at 21850 – 21900.Bank Nifty witnessed a sharp surge during the day and marched towards 46000. On the upside it is approaching key hurdles placed in the range 46370 – 46640 where the key daily moving averages are placed.

On the downside, 45200 shall act as a crucial support zone.Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst, LKP SecuritiesThe Nifty has formed a Piercing Line pattern on the daily chart, following a dark cloud cover in the preceding trading session. This consecutive complete reversal pattern indicates a highly volatile market sentiment. The trend may continue to be volatile on Thursday, especially as the interim budget will be delivered.

The agrochemical major is slated to release its October-December earnings on February 2.UPL is expected to report a net loss of Rs 527.80 crore in the third quarter of FY24 as against a net profit of Rs 1,326 crore in the year ago period, according to the average of estimates by four brokerages. The Q3 net loss will widen from Rs 189 crore in Q2.Revenue is also likely to slump nearly 29 percent on year to Rs 9,743 crore in Q3FY24, down from Rs 13,679 crore in the same period a year ago.Demand remains soft, pricing turns stiffThe company is struggling with a weak demand across most of its key markets like North America, Brazil, Europe and India, which is expected to put severe pressure on its Q3 revenue collections.Meanwhile, continued destocking of channel inventories across world markets and pricing pressure emanating from the huge influx of products from China will adversely affect UPL's performance in Q3.“The third quarter was difficult for the crop-protection chemicals industry, with exports likely hurt more than domestic sales amid continued destocking by customers. That said, even the domestic Rabi season was challenging amid low water levels, elevated channel inventories and intense competition,” brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities stated in a report.Kotak also expects UPL to be the worst hit by customer destocking and pricing pressures as it has the largest global presence within the industry.Nuvama Institutional Equities also expects UPL to see pressure on topline and margins for yet another quarter as liquidation of inventories continues.""Though we expect volume growth to moderate, a sharp price decline on a year-on-year basis to impact revenue growth. With pressure on margins, we expect EBITDA to decline and with negative operating leverage, we expect UPL to post losses,"" Nuvama added.Profitability to take a hitWith pressure on revenues and a drop in prices as the company offers higher rebates and discounts on collections, UPL's operating margin is expected to contract significantly in Q3.In addition, Equirus Capital also anticipates higher forex losses and higher interest expenses to further weigh on UPL's profitability. Most brokerages pegged a contraction of around 1,000-1,2000 basis points for UPL's EBITDA margin in Q3.Meanwhile, the government also lowered complex fertiliser subsidy rates for the second half of FY24 by more than 40 percent, which would lead to pressure on EBITDA per tonne, believes Elara Capital.Debt and debt reduction guidance to be in focusThe company's staggering debt levels as it remains caught in a demand downcycle remains the biggest cause of worry for investors and analysts. On top of that, the lack of clarity over the company's debt reduction targets has already pushed the stock into a pool of downgrades over the last few quarters.UPL's net debt stood at Rs 262 billion (Rs 26,200 crore) as of June. Even though the management announced a cost reduction drive of $100 million (Rs 8,304.2 crore) within two years, earlier this fiscal, they have not given a clear guidance on the debt reduction target for FY24.In such a scenario, stakeholders and analysts will remain focused on the company's commentary to find any clues on UPL's debt reduction guidance for Q4 as well as FY24.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. In a surprising turn of events, Saudi Arabia has directed its state-controlled oil giant, Aramco, to halt its plans to increase crude production capacity from 12 million barrels per day to 13 million barrels per day. This directive, issued by the Saudi Ministry of Energy, aims to maintain the current Maximum Sustainable Capacity (MSC).Following government instructions, Aramco, a publicly-listed company, had previously announced its intention to elevate production capacity to 13 million barrels per day by 2027.Analysts interpret this move as a cautionary signal regarding future demand. The International Energy Agency's (IEA) December annual report projected a global oil demand increase of 2.3 million barrels per day in 2023, reaching 101.7 million barrels per day. Oil prices experienced an upswing on Tuesday after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its global growth forecast.Saudi Arabia's decision is unexpected, particularly given assertions by various agencies that fossil fuel growth is in its concluding phase. Amidst the prevailing decarbonisation trend and global agreements to reduce carbon footprints, the move by Saudi Arabia seems counterintuitive.This decision is also surprising against the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Middle East impacting oil supplies, and the developments in the Americas where the United States is once again issuing threats of sanctions against oil-rich Venezuela.As the dominant force in the OPEC oil cartel, Saudi Arabia stands out as one of the few nations globally capable of increasing output, possessing a spare capacity of three million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia's decision suggests a strategic delay since other nations are maximising their oil production. It may be anticipating a reduction in production from other nations or engaging in a pricing strategy, expecting oil prices to rise as they constrain output.Irrespective of the motive, Saudi Arabia's actions are inflationary, likely to keep energy prices elevated. Unless alternative energy sources significantly impact fossil fuel consumption, Saudi Arabia appears poised to capitalise on every unit of oil it produces.Investing insights from our research teamMarico: Core categories remain subduedCraftsman Automation: Wider use of aluminium in vehicles augurs well; reasonable valuationLarsen & Toubro: Growth momentum could moderateMahindra Finance: Healthy Q3FY24 performance, with asset quality in focusPetronet LNG: Worst is over for this gas stock, earnings growth returnsCholamandalam Investment: Q3 margin stable on better asset mixWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: Wealth God, Honey make right (s) choice in Indiabulls Housing, unseasonal Rain, SME I-bankers in SEBI's crosshairs, MFs' tried and tested formulaUnion Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman’s excellent fiscal recordMature Indian investors know that Budget 2024 is but one of many stock market triggersBudget Snapshot: Government to step up focus on agriculture sector, execution keyWhy the Evergrande crisis is not a big dealMahindra Finance gets growth right, but costs bitePolitical strategy must steer rooftop solar power to the massesClimate bugs in developmental economicsLEX | The days of $100 oil prices are over (republished from the FT)Budget 2024 must focus on these six areas of transport infrastructureBudget 2024 has to provide an AI roadmap for Viksit BharatMusk loses $55 billion, but there’s a lot more at stake for TeslaForeign auto makers exiting China are making a smart moveThe world is transitioning to American oil from Saudi crudeTechnical Picks: Kalyan Jewellers, DLF, IPCA Lab, Bank of Baroda and Lead(These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Pro"
272,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/how-the-finance-commission-can-be-strengthened-12161881.html,How the Finance Commission can be strengthened,"January 31, 2024 02:41 PM IST","Much of the work and legacies of previous Finance Commissions is getting lost because it isn’t a permanent body. Administrative difficulties also abound. A provisional solution is to turn the Finance Commission Division (FCD), as the custodian of FC records and responsible for its award implementation, to be turned into full-fledged department, serving as the permanent secretariat for the Finance Commissions","Article 280 of the Indian Constitution stipulates that a Finance Commission (FC) has to be constituted every five years to set the parameters for distribution of taxes between the Union and the states along with the distribution principles amongst the states themselves. While Prof Arvind Panagariya already stands notified as 16th FC Chairman, other members and office bearers’ appointment may also take place soon. By October 2025, the Commission would have submitted its report and shut shop in all probability. That brings a fundamental poser – should there be a permanent FC? If not, is there an alternative option?Finance Commissions – Over The YearsMost economists and public policy practitioners favour the status quo. Part of the reason is that Article 280 has worked reasonably well. Beginning with the First FC in 1951, all FCs were commissioned in time. The FCs were dynamic, independent and progressive in resource distributive methodology. The Union Government’s flexible approach in terms of reference (ToR) also helped. Over the period, established economists and public finance professionals chaired successive FCs. KC Pant (10th FC) was the last politico to head an FC. This lent more credibility and respect to the FC recommendations.However, in the last two decades, the states bargained for increased share in the distributable taxes and resources. The 11th Finance Commission had recommended 29.5 percent for states in the proceeds of Union taxes. The 12th FC raised this to 30.5 percent; 13th FC to 32 percent; and the 14th FC raised this to a whopping 42 percent. The 15th FC had retained the same, if the share of the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh were to be factored in.The result has been a definite shift towards States without accounting for their responsibility and weakening of North Block. One example would suffice. On the fifth floor of a building in New Delhi’s CGO complex, there lies a sleepy office called the Finance Commission Division (FCD). The division, functioning under the administrative control of the Department of Expenditure in the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for timely release of funds based on the FC awards. Until the 13th FC award, this office was a major hub of activities and State Resident Commissioners were frequent visitors to this place. However, since then, the number of central schemes and centrally-sponsored schemes came down drastically. Concurrently, the number of staff and the visibility of the office also reduced.Three Arguments For A Permanent FCAdditionally, multiple practical considerations related to the FC, right from its notification to the award implementation – warrant a debate on the permanency of FC. First, an early challenge for any FC is to search for a centrally located place closer to the North Block and other ministries. Rented accommodations are no match to the aura of North Block. Residential accommodation and other logistical arrangements are equally challenging. The 12th FC had recommended that adequate arrangements for office and residence of the chairman and members of the FC must be made before the notification of the commission, so that the FC’s time is not wasted in routine administrative matters.Second, institutional memory and perpetuation of thought process matters! That way, subsequent FC might be losing out on the institutional wisdom, knowledge and experience of predecessor FCs. The records and files are sent to the FCD where they become part and parcel of the archival collection and serve no public purpose thereafter. These records are excellent primary sources and could lead to original PhDs and research papers on fiscal federalism and financing of disaster management.Third, there are post implementation problems as well. For instance, the 15th FC had recommended a non-lapsable modernisation fund for defence and internal security (MFDIS) and had even made the allotments to the Ministry of Defence and Home Affairs. Unfortunately, not enough progress could take place. Many grants are tied; such as holding of elections in the local bodies and fulfilment of other conditions. These are only representative problems; there are many others that could have been better managed by a permanent FC.Unfortunately, the entire debate on a permanent FC is under-developed. Perhaps, a middle way compromise would be to strengthen the Finance Commission Division in the Department of Expenditure itself. As the custodian of FC records and responsible for its award implementation, the FCD is best suited to carry forward the institutional legacy of outgoing FC in the interregnum. The 12th FC had indeed recommended that this division should be constituted into a full-fledged department, serving as the permanent secretariat for the Finance Commissions. While that is not possible, an expanded FCD with a larger mandate is the best way to perpetuate the spirit of FCs.Bhartendu Kumar Singh is in the Indian Defence Accounts Service and had served as Director, FCD, between 2018-21.

The sources declined to be identified as discussions with the regulator were confidential.SEBI and AMFI did not respond to requests for comment.Strong economic growth has propelled the benchmark BSE Sensex 20% higher over the past 52 weeks, but the BSE small-cap index has shot up 65% and the mid-cap index has surged 59% as investors latch on to stocks that they see as having greater upside potential.There have been record inflows into small and mid-cap funds, said the second source.Mutual funds that invest in small-cap stocks saw inflows of 432.8 billion rupees ($5.2 billion) in 2023, more than double the previous year, according to Value Research.Inflows into mid-cap funds climbed by a fifth to 248.8 billion rupees.Mutual funds tend to keep between 1% and 5% of their assets as cash as a prudent measure to meet outflows, according to public documents. There is, however, no minimum regulatory requirement.Funds need to invest at least 65% of their assets in small-cap stocks to be categorised as a small-cap fund and the remaining 35% can either be in cash or invested in large-cap stocks. The rule is similar for mid-cap funds.""Very early-stage discussions have happened on whether increasing cash in portfolio and having a buffer of large-cap stocks can help in stress events as a defensive measure,"" said one of the sources.In India, small-cap stocks are defined as those with market caps of less than 50 billion rupees while mid-cap stocks are those with market values of between 50 billion to 200 billion rupees."

Net profit for Q3 also rose nearly 11 percent on-year to Rs 1,378.9 crore, slightly below the estimated Rs 1,383 crore.Dependence on cancer drug worries analystsCLSA believes the strong dependence on Revlimid, which will go off-patent in January 2026, will keep Dr Reddy's overall revenue growth tepid over the medium term.The company's base US business saw price erosion, while the India market registered a decline in volumes due to lower chronic mix, CLSA added. CLSA believes the company's lower chronic mix will keep its revenue growth in the India business tepid over the medium-term.On that account, the firm downgraded the stock to 'underperform' from the previous 'buy' call but raised its price target to Rs 6,060 to factor in the strong Q3 earnings.Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities also remains cautious on Dr Reddy's, given the high concentration risk of Revlimid and base business molecules, slowdown in US launches and filings along with uncertainty around pipeline monetisation and subpar India performance which is yet to deliver on its innovative pipeline. Hence, the firm retained its 'reduce' call on the stock but raised its price target by 7.5 percent to Rs 5,020.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionDomestic sales fail to impressBrokerage house Motilal Oswal Financial Services highlighted the on-year moderation in Dr Reddy's India sales, which has been continuing for three quarters now. While the firm raised its earnings estimates for DRL by 4-7 percent for FY24-26 to price in market share expansion in key products, new drugs, and better operating leverage, it still expects a modest 3 percent earnings CAGR over the period.""Further, the product-specific concentration of earnings remains elevated for Dr Reddy's,"" the brokerage stated while retaining its 'neutral' call on the stock. MOFSL assigned a price target of Rs 5,540 for Dr Reddy's.Brokerage firm Citi highlighted the sharp margin expansion for Dr Reddy's in its Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI) segment due to an increase in licensing income which lifted the company's EBITDA margin to 28 percent in Q3, higher than the expected 24 percent. However, the firm also cautioned that this expansion in the PSAI segment implies that margins in the company's core business might be trending lower.Accordingly, keeping a cautious stance, Citi also retained its 'sell' call on the stock, with a price target of Rs 5,290.On January 30, shares of Dr Reddy's settled flat at Rs 5,840.95 on the NSE.Also Read | Dr Reddy's Q3 results: Net profit up 11% to Rs 1,379 crore, marginally misses estimates Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Therefore, we expect some persisting hints of tough language at this week's FOMC,"" said Benoit Anne, managing director in the investment solutions group at MFS Investment Management.""But there is nothing to worry about. The macro backdrop is as good as we have seen in a very long time, characterised by diminished recession risks and favourable disinflation dynamics.""Data on Tuesday showed U.S. job openings unexpectedly increased in December and data for the prior month was revised higher, pointing to a still-resilient labour market that is likely to give the Fed room to keep rates higher for longer.That propped up the two-year Treasury yield, which typically reflects near-term interest rate expectations. It was last at 4.3345%, having risen more than eight basis points for the month.The U.S. dollar similarly held broadly steady, with the euro down 0.18% at $1.0823. Sterling fell 0.17% to $1.26795.Among commodities, oil prices dipped after climbing in the previous session as tensions linger in the Middle East. [O/R]Brent futures slipped 38 cents to $82.49 a barrel. U.S. crude lost 32 cents to $77.50 per barrel.Gold last bought $2,033.94 an ounce, retreating from a two-week top hit in the previous session."

""These measures could make the new regime more attractive compared to the old, influencing taxpayer choices,"" said Jonagadla.With a rich experience of more than 12 years which includes quantitative research, Jonagadla says he is avoiding the private banking sector, anticipating heightened volatility over the next 2-3 months.Is the market yet to be overstretched in terms of valuations and what could be the triggers in the short to medium term?The market's current valuation, with Nifty's Trailing 12 Month PE at around 23.1, slightly above the 24-month average of 21.6, suggests valuations are somewhat stretched but not alarmingly so. In the short to medium term, the primary catalysts are anticipated to be the unfolding quarterly results season, which has just commenced.Additionally, the upcoming Budget and evolving geopolitical scenarios, particularly in the Red Sea and Middle East regions, are likely to significantly influence market trends. Overall, while valuations are slightly above average, they remain within our comfortable range, with key events on the horizon poised to shape market directions.Which are the themes on your radar for investment, and why?Our investment focus is centered around ""The Bharat Story,"" a narrative driven by demographic dynamism, strategic policy reforms, technological innovation, and infrastructural development. India's youthful population is not just a demographic feature but a catalyst for economic growth, driving consumption and innovation.Also read: Ahead of Budget, IMF raises India's FY25, FY26 GDP growth forecasts to 6.5%Key investment themes in the short to medium term include:Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs): We prefer it for stability and consistent dividends. They offer a unique blend of security and growth potential, reflecting India's developmental priorities.Infrastructure Development: Investments in infrastructure are essential to India's growth narrative, enhancing trade connectivity and urbanization.Defence: In addition to the previously mentioned themes, the defence sector in India for the next 5-6 years presents a significant investment opportunity.With the government's commitment to self-reliance and increasing defense spending, this sector is emerging as a key area of growth. India's focus on bolstering its defense capabilities, including areas like aerospace, cybersecurity, and defense manufacturing, aligns with global geopolitical shifts and the need for enhanced security measures.Do you expect the interim budget to be a bit of game changer for the equity markets in near term? What do you expect the budget?As the interim budget approaches, with elections on the horizon, significant policy shifts are unlikely. The expectation is that the Finance Minister will focus on enhancing the new tax regime's appeal, potentially through provisions for additional tax savings and an increase in the standard deduction. These measures could make the new regime more attractive compared to the old, influencing taxpayer choices.Also read: Budget 2024: Do budgets impact market trends?While these changes are modest, they might have a subtle, positive impact on the equity markets by potentially increasing disposable income and consumer spending. However, given the nature of an interim budget, major game-changing announcements are not anticipated. The emphasis is likely to be on fiscal prudence.Will it (2024) be the year of banking space? In addition, do you see any growth concerns for the NBFCs, especially after recent RBI moves?In 2024, the banking space might not be the primary focus in the short term due to expected volatility. Recent RBI regulations, particularly impacting NBFCs, have introduced a significant shift. The ban on NBFCs using AIFs for loan evergreening aims to curb risk-concealing practices and enforce greater transparency. This rule is crucial in maintaining genuine asset quality, revealing the actual financial health of these institutions.Moreover, RBI's move to align HFC regulations with NBFCs, especially regarding liquid asset maintenance and deposit rules, indicates a trend towards tighter regulatory control. These changes, while beneficial for long-term sector stability, could lead to short-term challenges like tightened liquidity for some NBFCs, potential widening of credit spreads, and higher borrowing costs.Given these dynamics, a cautious approach towards the banking and NBFC sectors seems prudent in the near term, as we navigate through the evolving regulatory landscape and assess the broader market implications.Are you taking exposure in the technology space that saw sharp run up after a long time?In the technology space, we're selectively avoiding large-cap IT names, instead focusing on Midcap and Smallcap IT stocks. Our preference leans towards these smaller companies, as we believe they hold greater potential for outperformance compared to their large-cap counterparts.Which are the sectors that you want to avoid or stay away now?Currently, we are steering clear of the Private Banking sector, anticipating heightened volatility over the next 2-3 month.What is your high alpha-generating strategy?Our strategy is centered around sophisticated quantitative methods, meticulously designed to adapt to prevailing market trends. The cornerstone of our approach is an unwavering commitment to robust risk management. We diligently maintain the risk exposure of our investment baskets within predefined, comfortable limits. This focus on risk control plays a pivotal role in our strategies.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Here's why,"January 31, 2024 09:48 AM IST","The L&T stock has zoomed 71 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty 50 which has risen 21 percent during this period.","Shares of construction major L&T fell 5 percent on January 31 after the company's Q3 earnings missed Street estimates. Its net profit jumped 15 percent on-year to Rs 2,947 crore on better execution of infrastructure projects and continued growth in the IT and tech services portfolio. Its revenue also jumped 19 percent YoY to Rs 55,128 crore.While the December quarter numbers came in below street expectations, analysts remain bullish on the stock.Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect L&T to continue to benefit from the strong addressable market in both India and international locations. Going forward, the company's growth is expected to be driven by growth in order inflows; a gradual recovery in core EPC EBITDA margin; and control over working capital and net working capital (NWC).""We expect the infrastructure and hydrocarbon segments to remain the key growth drivers for LT,"" it noted.L&T's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 14 percent YoY to Rs 5,760 crore during the quarter. The company won orders worth Rs 75,990 crore at the group level during Q3 FY24, logging a 25.2 percent YoY growth. International orders at Rs 50,562 crore comprised 67 percent of the total order inflow.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionOutlookThe company's prospect pipeline for Q4 FY24 stands at Rs 6.3 lakh crore, up 29 percent YoY. The pipeline has been boosted by strong order inflows in the hydrocarbon segment. Stable oil prices auger well for prospects in the hydrocarbon segment and improve overall prospects in the Middle East, according to Motilal Oswal.L&T is cautiously bidding for thermal power projects, the brokerage noted. ""The hi-tech energy segment is still small, with a prospect pipeline of Rs 16,000 crore, but it will grow at a fast pace,"" the brokerage said.L&T has been focusing on reducing working capital through improved collections and better customer advances. The brokerage expects L&T's working capital to remain comfortable at around 17-18 percent of sales, as the overall project mix is changing in favor of projects that have NWC such as international and mega and ultra-mega projects.With expected improvements in margins in FY25, there is scope for further Return on Equity (RoE) expansion, it said.Stock call: Why you should buy L&T sharesMorgan Stanley has issued an overweight call on L&T with a target price of Rs 4,171 per share. The brokerage highlighted L&T's continued strong execution, despite potential ordering activity slowdown due to elections. However, the company's core margin guidance has been adjusted downward due to timing differences. On the positive side, L&T's working capital is expected to remain steady, it said.Motilal Oswal has a 'buy' rating on the stock with an increased target price of Rs 4,200 based on the SOTP methodology, valuing the core business at P/E of 28x Mar’26 EPS and a 25 percent holding company discount for subsidiaries.""Our higher multiple takes into account the continuously improving prospect pipeline and improvements in NWC and RoE despite margins being lower than guidance,"" it said.InCred has also issued an 'add' call on L&T, with a target price set at Rs 4,016 per share. L&T's management has revised its FY24 order inflow growth guidance upward to 20 percent from 15 percent earlier, reflecting confidence in future prospects, the brokerage noted.Additionally, the company has adjusted its FY24 revenue guidance to 15 percent from the previous range of 12-15 percent, driven by a robust order pipeline.Key risks and concernsA slowdown in order inflows, delays in the completion of mega and ultra-mega projects, a sharp rise in commodity prices, higher crude prices, an increase in receivables and working capital, and increased competition are a few downside risks for L&T, according to Motilal Oswal.Also Read | L&T Q3 results: Net profit rises 15% to Rs 2,947 crore, misses estimatesOn January 30, L&T shares closed 1.8 percent lower at Rs 3,639.85 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

Edited excerpts:Do you expect any major announcements in the interim budget with general elections a few months away?One is not expecting any major reforms or key changes in this interim budget. Historically, whenever we have gone for an interim budget, it is largely a low-key event, yet it is done in the schedule and practice of presenting a union budget. Therefore, though we do have a lot of anticipation, it is going to be a low-key affair.One would not go into reading much into it or having high expectations because even the government would want to play it safe. This budget is going to be just a regular activity where one will not expect too many big- bang announcements or action.Click Here To Read All Budget Related NewsWhich are the sectors to watch out for in the budget?The sectors to watch for, which will actually have a bearing in the long run, are renewable energy, domestic tourism and travel industry. Over the last two-three years, we have seen increasing importance of manufacturing, defence services and even infrastructure.We are in a situation where some of the sectors that are in the news now like defence, manufacturing and railways will continue to be the focus areas. However, we will see a lot more activity right now going forward into renewables, solar and incentives for sustainable practices.Also read: Budget 2024: Do budgets impact market trends?Is it time to be cautious on staples sector?On the staple side one cannot say you’ve to be cautious right now. The market is well poised as far as the staple sector is concerned. While everybody expects the economy to do better quarter by quarter, year after year, rather than being cautious, more or less, people are going to be measured about the outcome and the exposure of the sector.Most experts are bullish on the power and power ancillary space, which has recorded healthy gains so far. Is it looking overbought?Clearly power ancillaries, power distribution and power equipment have all done phenomenally well in the last year or so. If one looks at it from the perspective of a slightly long-term view, they have done good in the last one year. When you look at a long term trend of India’s need for power and the need for the entire distribution and the equipment ecospace, we still have a long runway to go.It is also a point to note that so much of the gains have come frontloaded, though this is not the end of the story or that from here it is going to be downhill, there is still more room but it won't be as aggressive or as swift as what we’ve seen in the past year or so. But structurally the sector is looking very good and it has many many more good years but one has to taper down the expectation and look for a more normal or a healthy growth.Also read: Ahead of Budget, IMF raises India's FY25, FY26 GDP growth forecasts to 6.5%Do you expect the Federal Reserve to give a firm direction on the interest rate cut cycle in the policy meeting that starts today?One is looking at the Fed’s action very seriously. The meetings and the schedules that have started right now at some point should give us an indication of how 2024 is going to be. While the market is hoping that the Fed’s actions will eventually be more positive towards the markets, one really cannot say till the announcements are made.The most prudent way to anticipate the Fed’s reaction is to wait till the announcements are made. Given the very different kinds of circumstances that we are presently in, it’s better to wait rather than speculate.What is your take on the consumer discretionary and the auto space?Both consumer discretionary and auto space at some level fall into the core/fundamental aspect of the economy doing well. I believe that irrespective of how they have been in the last few quarters, they make a very interesting play and within them, there are a few companies that are outliers in that space.It’s something that you have to dig deep and pay attention to right amount of research and good quality stock picking or even fund selection to make the most out of that space.Are the current earnings and management commentaries in line with your expectations?At a macro level, the earnings outcomes and the management commentaries are more or less looking good. Most of them are in line with the consensus of the market. Some of them have done better. The interesting part is that most of them are anticipating better days ahead.By and large, the earnings are in line with the expectations and the management commentaries are looking favourable. In some cases, they are very bullish. Overall, the takeaway is that the earning numbers and the commentaries are that we are in a reasonably good situation looking forward.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

This abrupt shift from a bullish sentiment to a bearish reversal signifies potential weakening of the prevailing uptrend. The Nifty concluded Tuesday's trading session near the 20 DMA at 21,520 levels, down 1 percent. While the 50 DMA is positioned at 21,200 levels as the next important support.The India VIX, the fear gauge, has experienced a significant surge and surpassed the 16 level. The last time India VIX closed above this threshold was in March 2023. This rise in the fear gauge suggests intensified market volatility.In summary, a break below the 20,500 level could lead to a downward movement in the Nifty, while surpassing the 22,124 level might signal the onset of the next rally targeting 22,750 and 23,000.Bank Nifty concluded at 45,368, marking a modest decline of 0.16 percent. Notably, Bank Nifty encountered robust resistance at 45,650-45,700 levels, leading to corrections in the preceding two sessions.The 200-day moving average (DMA) at 44,500 acts as a critical support with a breach below this level that could intensify selling in the index.In a broader context, following a correction of nearly 7 percent from its all-time high of 48,636.45, the Bank Nifty faces a crucial juncture. A further decline below the important level of 43,700, representing a nearly 10 percent correction, could signal the potential extended correction. On the other hand, if this level is defended, the path seems open for a gradual and steady ascent towards its previous peak levels.Here are three buy calls for short termDr Lal PathLabs: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,476 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,380 | Target: Rs 2,610 | Return: 5.4 percentThe stock is currently trading above its 20 simple moving average (SMA), reinforcing a robust support level in price action. Exiting the accumulation zone, the stock exhibits positive signal and is trading above the middle Bollinger band with a positive MACD (moving average convergence divergence) indicator crossover. These indicators suggest a bullish momentum highlighting the stock's strength.Although minor resistance exists around Rs 2,500 levels, once crossed, strong traction is expected on the higher side.Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 2,476.2 for a target price of Rs 2,610. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 2,380.Bharat Dynamics: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,702 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,625 | Target: Rs 1,840 | Return: 8 percentIn the daily chart, the stock is actively shaping a compelling bottom double pattern showcasing a potential reversal. Its resilience is evident through consistent trading above the 20-day moving average.The RSI (relative strength index) of 57 emphasize a favourable bullish momentum, reinforcing the stock's strength. Notably, a noteworthy breakthrough occurred as the stock closed above the crucial 1,700 resistance levels indicating heightened buying interest especially among short-term traders.Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP of Rs 1,702.3 for a target price of Rs 1,840. The stop-loss can be kept at Rs 1,625.DLF: Buy | LTP: Rs 786.90 | Stop-Loss: Rs 755 | Target: Rs 840 | Return: 7 percentThe stock is demonstrating a bullish trend, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows. It sustains a positive momentum by trading above both the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA).Significantly, it maintains a robust support level at 23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement and remains above a sturdy support zone of Rs 770 levels. The noteworthy increase in delivery volume by 23 percent over the past month adds to the positive indicator as well.Hence, based on the above technical structure, one can initiate a long position at CMP Rs 786.9 for the target price of Rs 840.

But, they could also indicate that they are ""not in as much of a hurry as the market expects to cut rates.""The Fed could also suggest that they don't want rates to be too restrictive as they aim to generate a soft economic landing, Chandler noted.Many analysts expect the Fed's first rate cut will be aimed at preventing too wide a gap between inflation and the fed funds rate, as this would tighten financial conditions more than the Fed intends.Treasury yields fell and the dollar weakened after Powell in December indicated that the Fed was pivoting to an easing cycle.The dollar index was last up 0.04% at 103.52. The currency is largely seen as consolidating before Wednesday's Fed decision and highly anticipated US jobs data for January due on Friday.The euro gained after data showed the euro zone avoided a technical recession in the fourth quarter. It was last up 0.08% at $1.08400.Gross domestic product (GDP) in the 20 countries sharing the euro was flat in the fourth quarter against the previous three months, mainly because of strong growth in Portugal and Spain and a modest increase in Italy, while the German economy shrank in the final three months of 2023.The dollar has rebounded against the single currency this year on expectations the U.S. economy will fare better than the euro zone.""For the ECB, today's figure eases the pressure somewhat, but it is clear that the so-called soft landing being pursued by (ECB President Christine) Lagarde has been somewhat softer than many would have liked,"" said Joshua Mahony, Chief Market Analyst at Scope Markets.Investors are fully pricing in a rate cut by the European Central Bank in April.Sterling slid 0.38% to $1.26610 ahead of the Bank of England's monetary policy meeting this week.The US currency rose 0.11% to 147.63 against the yen.Japan's jobless rate fell to 2.4% in December from the previous month, government data showed on Tuesday, just under economists' median forecast of 2.5% in a Reuters poll."

The ministry had assumed in its calculations in the Union Budget presented on February 1, 2023 that the nominal GDP would grow 10.5 percent this year to Rs 301.75 lakh crore.Economists' expectations of next year's nominal growth are in a fairly wide range of 9.5 percent to 11.5 percent.""Fiscal consolidation in India has mostly been revenue-driven due to expenditure rigidities. Therefore, the economic growth has a strong bearing on tax collection and, in turn, on fiscal consolidation,"" India Ratings and Research noted.However, brokerages seem a little more optimistic and their estimates lie anywhere between 10 percent and 11.5 percent.Two years of very high nominal growth – thanks to high inflation and a favourable base – in 2021-22 and 2022-23 helped the Centre rapidly bring down its fiscal deficit to an expected 5.9 percent of GDP this year from 9.2 percent in 2020-21. But with the base effect normalising, nominal growth has come off sharply from 16.1 percent in 2022-23 and 18.4 percent in 2021-22."

The pharmaceutical major is slated to detail its Q3 earnings on January 31.Sun Pharma’s fiscal third-quarter net profit is expected to grow 9 percent on-year to Rs 2,373 crore, according to the average of estimates by eight brokerages. Revenue is likely to grow at 11 percent on-year in Q3FY24 to Rs 12,278 crore. This would be driven by strong sales of specialty products, contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid, and robust growth in the domestic market.Among the brokerage estimates collated by Moneycontrol, Kotak Institutional Equities rolled out the most bearish growth projections, while Systematix Institutional Equities was the most optimistic.Favourable base, field force addition to aid domestic salesMost brokerages anticipate high single-digit or low double-digit on-year growth for Sun Pharma's domestic business in Q3. JM Financial pegged domestic sales growth at around 9 percent in Q3, outperforming the overall sales growth in the Indian pharmaceuticals market, aided by improved demand for antidiabetic drugs and a favourable base.It also identified field force expansion, sales growth in the chronics segment and price hikes as the key growth drivers for Sun Pharma's domestic business.Robust specialty sales, resilient Revlimid to contribute to US revenuesOver the years, Sun Pharma has reduced its dependence on generics in the US market, shifting its focus towards specialty products. Jefferies factored in the highest growth for Sun Pharma as the company is likely to benefit from seasonality of specialty products, traction in the recently launched Vyvanse (used to treat hyperactivity disorder), and a surge in sales of respiratory drugs Albuterol and Ipratropium. Sales of specialty drugs are also expected to benefit from the marginal growth in the psoriasis drug Ilumya and market share growth in the ophthalmic drug Cequa.Apart from that, strong sales from Sun Pharma's US subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical Industries and a resilient contribution of around $20 million from the blockbuster generic cancer drug Revlimid are also seen aiding US revenues for Sun Pharma in Q3.Margins may shrink on higher R&D expensesWhile the drugmaker's top and bottom lines are likely to grow in Q3, its operating margin may shrink by around 100 basis points over the previous year to 25.8 percent, according to Kotak Institutional Equities.The decline in operating margins is on account of higher research and development spending as the company focuses on expanding its specialty portfolio.Investors will also remain focused on the company's specialty pipeline and further guidance on its R&D expenses.Also Read | Sun Pharma market cap breezes past Rs 3 lakh crore, stock hits 52-week highDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

372,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/overhiring-or-ai-impact-indian-it-firms-divided-on-why-employee-headcount-is-declining-12149671.html,Overhiring or AI impact: Indian IT firms divided on why employee headcount is declining,"January 30, 2024 10:56 AM IST",The industry is divided over whether disruptive technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) are making certain jobs redundant.,"India's leading information technology companies are divided on the impact of disruptive technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), on job redundancy. The industry is witnessing a divergence of opinions within its key players regarding the extent to which emerging technologies might replace certain roles.However, industry leaders argue that their employee headcounts are expected to increase once demand rebounds. In the interim, major companies such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and others plan to enhance efficiency by leveraging their current talent pool rather than reducing it.The Indian IT sector, one of the country's largest private sector employers, has traditionally engaged in extensive hiring from colleges. However, recruitment in this industry, which boasts a workforce of over 54 lakhs, has been restrained due to sluggish demand. This downturn is a consequence of macroeconomic uncertainty and anticipations of a recession in key markets.As a result, a continued decline in headcount has been witnessed, on an average, in the past couple of quarters.Reports suggest that financial year 2023-24 could be the first in 25 years that the $250-billion industry will end up with fewer employees than it started with.“The reality is that many of us hired aggressively over the last few years… there has been a slow demand environment over (financial year) 2023-24 and I think it’s just the after-effects of that,” Wipro’s Executive Chairman Rishad Premji said on January 18 while speaking to Moneycontrol.In Q3, India’s top four IT companies reported a reduction of over 20,000 employees. Even in Q2, India's top three IT companies had reported a decline of over 21,000 in the workforce.Infosys chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) Salil Parekh said his company is making sure that it becomes more efficient by not hiring people at this stage in a big way.“The work that we’re seeing is more focused on cost and automation, and so as the digital, cloud, or Gen AI programmes begin, we will start to see more expansion,” Parekh said, while speaking to Moneycontrol in Davos.The Bengaluru-based IT services major saw its headcount shrink by 6,101 in the October-December quarter, making it the fourth consecutive quarter it ended with fewer employees.K Krithivasan, CEO and MD of India’s largest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), said the company decided not to backfill attrition and deploy employees internally when it first saw weakness in demand. “So that's the reason you find that our… fresh recruitment is slower than the attrition,” Krithivasan said in Davos.TCS' headcount plunged by 5,680 on a net basis in Q3, which was its second consecutive quarterly decline.But the Tata-group company is still hiring and any increase in headcount will reflect a demand uptick, Krithivasan said. “Only when we get a much better handle on the demand outlook will I be able to tell you when you would see a positive (headcount); we need to have better demand visibility.”Nonetheless, all the executives expressed optimism about the long-term prospects of the industry.“The demand for engineering talent, for programming talent, for design talent, is not going to diminish. So, in the medium to long run, I am very optimistic about the business,” Mohit Joshi, CEO and MD of Tech Mahindra, told Moneycontrol in his first media interaction since taking over the role in December.Gen AI: Boom or gloom?While agreeing that headcount will get back on track sooner or later, the executives were split in their assessment of whether Gen AI has already started replacing or making certain job roles redundant. Wipro and HCLTech said this nascent technology is not the reason headcount is reducing. TCS, on the other hand, said the net reduction was a fallout of some amount of “automation” and “production gain.”Wipro’s Premji said he would “not argue” that the reduction in headcount is because of the elements of “disruptive productivity coming into play on scale” to change the hiring quotient.HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar had a more nuanced view, saying there are three aspects to determine whether jobs are being made redundant or not by Gen AI. Firstly, he said business process outsourcing will definitely see job cuts. Second, software development will see efficiency improvement by 10-30 percent, albeit at a gradual pace. And finally, managed services and application infrastructure support is already highly automated, being driven by machine learning and hyper automation solutions, Vijayakumar pointed out.“So effectively, I don't see this (Gen AI) to be reducing headcount. There's going to be a lot more work around Gen AI and all of that, I think that will more than offset in the next set of discretionary spends,” Vijayakumar added.All in all, the IT industry bosses have a positive long-term outlook, though they anticipate short-term challenges stemming from the industry-wide slowdown, translating into a decline in headcount.Also read: Top honchos of TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCLTech, Cognizant turn optimistic amid uncertainties"

Brokerages had projected cigarette volumes to expand up to 5 percent.Net revenue for the segment was up around 2.3 percent year-on-year.Jefferies said the consolidation in the near-term volumes played out exactly like the company highlighted.The premium segment did well but mass offerings underperformed, domestic brokerage Emkay Global said. “For Q4FY24, we are now building ~2 percent volume growth and see ~3 percent growth over FY25 and FY26. Positive volume growth outlook can be attributed to better execution, market share gains, and sustained innovation,” it said.Brokerages do not expect tax shocks in the upcoming budget. The company has also been passing the tax hikes onto the consumer, which will lead to margin expansion, aiding high single-digit EBIT growth over FY 25-26.FMCG surprisesHSBC said that ITC’s FMCG and others segment stood out with its 7.6 percent revenue growth and 100 basis points EBITDA margin expansion over last year.The business delivered resilient performance amid slowdown in consumer demand, with staples, dairy, beverages, and homecare segments driving growth, HSBC analysts said.The competitive intensity remained high in categories such as biscuits, snacks, noodles and popular soaps from local/regional players.“Going ahead, while we see other FMCG growth in high single digits, profit is likely to be in mid-single digit, given cumulative PLI benefit in the base,” Emkay Global said.As the demand improves, more local and regional players come into play in the FMCG segment and eat into the market share of  bigger players.Also Read | ITC Q3 results: Net profit rises 11% to Rs 5,572 crore; interim dividend announcedAgri, paperboard segments underperformMorgan Stanley said that the poor performance of the agri business weighed on the company’s topline. “Agri business should report a decline on a high base amid restrictions. Weakness in the paper business is likely to sustain in FY25,” Emkay said.ITC Hotels surpasses estimatesITC Hotels reported better revenue than estimates, said Morgan Stanley. Hotels continued to report strong performance, reporting their best-ever quarter, with 18 percent sales and 57 percent EBIT YoY growth.Its plan to demerge the hotels business had been cleared by the stock exchanges, the company said.OutlookFactoring in the Q3 performance, Emkay Global cut its topline expectations by 3-4 percent over FY24-26E, which led to a 3-5 percent earnings cut.

NII during the quarter increased 29 percent YoY to Rs 7,655 crore, while number of new loans booked grew by 26 percent on-year to 9.86 million during the same period.Stock call: Should you buy, hold or sell Bajaj Finance?HSBC has issued a 'buy' call on Bajaj Finance with the target price set at Rs 8,900 per share despite the company's third-quarter earnings falling short of estimates due to reduced fees and increased credit costs.The brokerage has, however, lowered its earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 3-5 percent for FY24-26 to account for slower loan growth and decreased fees. Despite these challenges, Bajaj Finance Managing Director Rajeev Jain affirmed his commitment to actively shaping the strategy for Bajaj Finance.Nomura has also put a 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 8,800 per share, stating that the NBFC's Q3 results were in line with expectations, although there was a slight deterioration in asset quality.""Despite this, there was strong growth in assets under management (AUM) across segments, except for rural business-to-consumer (B2C) operations. Pre-provision operating profit (PpOP) growth remained robust,"" it noted.However, there was an increase in Bajaj Finance's credit costs despite a decline in the provision coverage ratio (PCR), and stress levels remained high in unsecured segments, noted Nomura. ""Overall, despite these minor setbacks, the company's performance remains well within the guided range,"" it said.Jefferies is also bullish on Bajaj Finance as it put a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 9,400 per share. Strong growth in assets under management (AUM) and improved net interest margins (NIMs) contributed to a rise in the net interest income (NII).However, there was disappointment in asset quality due to slippage in personal loans, the international brokerage noted.

This was the highest monthly outflow since January 2023.In January, the Sensex was down 0.4 percent, while Nifty gained 0.05 percent. Other Asian countries also experienced losses: Hang Seng fell by 5.8 percent, Shanghai declined 4.3 percent, Kospi lost 9 percent, and Jakarta 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, the Topix index rose 2 percent, while Nikkei advanced by 2.6 percent.Apart from India, Sri Lanka saw outflows of $6 million, this month. However, other Asian countries saw inflows. Japan led with the highest equity inflows of $12.28 billion, followed by South Korea and Taiwan with $2.23 and $1.72 billion, respectively.Thailand got around $803.4 million, Indonesia received around $407 million in inflows, Malaysia $92 million, Philippines $85.2 million, and Vietnam $45 million. China’s foreign fund flow data is not updated. According to a recent Kotak report, China saw inflows of $10.8 billion in December 2023.According to Rajesh Palviya, Analyst, Axis Securities, the Indian outflow has been because of subdued corporate earnings visa-vis valuations, which has made investors cautious.Analysts noted that FII selling in India was particularly triggered by HDFC Bank's results. Additionally, the rise in US treasury yields prompted FIIs to book profits in the Indian markets. Analysts further said that across the globe, markets have been volatile due to the situation in the Middle East, and its impact on global growth and inflation.Globally, attention is on the next meeting of the US FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) on January 30-31, 2024. With the expectation that there will be no rate cut, the focus is on the commentary as the macroeconomic data shows improvement, said Neeraj Gaurh, Fund Manager, Axis Securities, PMS .Analysts are optimistic about the Indian economy, and foresee financial stability and sustainable growth. The outlook includes expectations of manageable inflation and a stable cost of borrowing. Despite limited fiscal space, the government is urged to maintain a delicate balance between fiscal deficit and growth through government capex. While new market highs bring excitement, analysts caution against potential geopolitical risks. They emphasise that earnings growth, rather than valuation re-rating, will be the key driver for the markets.According to Deepak Jasani, Analysts, HDFC Securities, Indian equities may continue to see volatile times in the first half of 2024 due to the elections and a global change in central banks’ views on interest rates. Sell-offs can result in bargain buying by existing and new players as the view on India remains positive, while profits can be booked when stock prices rise, he added.SEBI's additional disclosuresRecent news reports suggested that FIIs in India are selling to adhere to SEBI's enhanced disclosure norms aimed at preventing manipulation of minimum public shareholding (MPS) rules, and avoiding indirect control of Indian companies by overseas entities through shell firms. However, some news reports also suggested that the granular details of beneficial ownership required from FIIs may be lower than initially asked for in SEBI's consultation paper.In 2023, SEBI mandated additional disclosures for FIIs holding over 50 percent of their Indian equity AUM (assets under management) in a single corporate group, or with over Rs 25,000 crore in AUM in Indian markets, with the goal of protecting investors against potential circumvention of MPS rules.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Edited excerpts:What are the factors that helped you decide to upgrade your US rating to overweight?We expect the US to outperform its peers in the developed market given strong earnings momentum and peak Fed policy, which is positive for tech-related plays. Propelled by tailwinds from rising interest in artificial intelligence, we believe tech-related industries will remain on an upward trajectory should incoming inflation data remain benign. This, in turn, will underpin the outperformance of US equities over Europe and Japan, given its larger exposure to the tech-related segment.Is gold in a sweet spot? Should one start to focus on companies that are beneficiaries of the gold rally?Tailwinds from geopolitical risks and persistent central bank buying provide further upside for gold.We analysed past risk-off incidents to see their effects on gold prices and found that such episodes resulted in gold rallies that lasted an average of 15 days and resulted in an average price increase of 8 percent.The latest Middle East conflict corresponds neatly with this analysis; the rally lasted 15 days, and prices rose 9.5 percent trough to peak. Should there be signs of escalation and regional spread, we will likely see gold rally again in short bursts.Additional tailwinds for gold can be found in central bank buying, which turned from net negative in April and May 2023 to net positive in June, July, and August 2023. After setting a first-half record in 1H23, central bank buying maintained its momentum and in July and August, taking 9M23 cumulative purchases to 800 tonnes.Investors can gain exposure to gold via the following expressions: i) physical gold; ii) gold futures; iii) ETFs and managed funds on physical gold and gold mining equities; or iv) direct holdings in gold mining equities, which are essentially a leveraged expression of gold.Also read: Do's and Dont's for traders to protect from big losses on Budget dayWill the the US Federal Reserve cut the rate by 125 basis points (bps) in 2024, higher than 75 bps it hinted at? Will the cuts start in the second quarter of 2024?The Fed will likely keep rates on hold (at current elevated levels) in the forthcoming months until recessionary signals emerge or when inflation starts to trend down. Financial conditions have been remarkably benign over the past few months amidst a perceived Fed pivot and lower rates. All the components of the index – credit spreads, short-term funding stresses, implied volatilities – all contributed to better sentiment.Fundamentally, there are good reasons backing a more optimistic outlook. These include clear signs that the Fed is on a pause, inflation is generally falling and economic activity appears resilient.Accordingly, the soft landing/Goldilocks dynamic that has been in play since Q3-CY23 may yet extend. Short of clear signs of slowdown or financial market stress, we think 100 bps in the second half is more likely.Nonetheless, we are watchful of potential risks that could shift the narrative. Rates are remarkably attuned to data at this stage in the cycle. Risks to growth and inflation appear balanced, and weekly jobs data and CPI data may yet skew rates.Do you expect a soft landing in the US?Given the absence of structural imbalances among households and companies, a US economic “soft landing” remains our base case scenario. While slower economic growth and inflation rate point to a peak in US rates in 2024, the burden of elevated rates weighs on demand in the US and EU  but a recession is unlikely in either area given their economic resilience.A gradual softening of the US labour market materialises in moderation of consumption demand; similarly, in the Euro Area, growth flattens in the core economies.In Asia, China continues to address issues related to its property and tech sectors while keeping growth above 4 percent.With respect to Asean countries, we see a 50bps pick-up in annual real GDP growth, driven by a bottoming of the electronics export cycle and continued recovery in travel and tourism.This scenario is contingent on an orderly financial sector. Liquidity stays ample despite quantitative tightening, US treasuries remain well bid by the private sector, USD weakens, and commodity markets stabilise.Also read: LIC’s proposed stake buyout in HDFC Bank ‘well-timed’, has limited downsideAre you super bullish on technology and consumer discretionary sectors?For the US, we are overweight on tech and neutral consumer discretionary. The tech sector will benefit from tailwinds such as rising interest in AI.Do you see global investors increasing exposure significantly to India?Despite challenges such as elevated oil prices, uneven private sector investments and a hawkish Fed driving overall volatility in financial markets, India’s economy stayed resilient, powered by its rapid growth (GDP growth is expected to average 6-6.5 percent YoY in FY24), massive working-age labour force and rising manufacturing prowess.Supportive policies add further tailwinds; positive liquidity conditions amid bets of Fed rate cuts in 2024 and an accommodative central bank policy continue to drive growth. Widely seen as a prime alternative in the ‘China+1’ strategy, India has also built a reputation as a prime offshoring location.Amid high valuations, investors continue to plow cash into India’s stock market; overseas funds poured more than $21 billion into India shares in 2023, helping the S&P BSE Sensex Index cap an eighth consecutive year of gains.India still has a long way to go in its infrastructure to show the world it can handle all the interest that is coming its way – a sustained pick up in capex and widespread job creation are needed for India to live up to its compelling growth story.On the India front, which are the themes that are on your radar for a portfolio or investment?These are India’s sectoral jewels to look out for:IT servicesIndia, with its multiple homegrown IT services powerhouses, will benefit as the global digital economy expands. A financial analysis we conducted of the Top 5 IT services companies in India (Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and HCL Technologies) found that the collective revenue of these companies grew nearly three times between 2010 and 2021. Net profits have followed a similar trend. The sector offers a million-strong workforce and has a robust capital structure.Banking sectorIndia’s banking sector has grown substantially over the past decade. The country’s strong economic growth helped to grow middle-class wealth and income, which in turn led to rising consumption and demand for credit.Total banking assets grew from $2.2 trillion in 2020 to $2.7 trillion in 2022. Against this backdrop of steady growth, we expect an increase in demand for both corporate and retail loans, especially in the areas of services, consumer durables, agriculture, and real estate.Consumer staples sectorAs the most populous nation in the world, demographic factors will continue to be an important growth driver for the consumer staples sector in India. FMCG is the fourth largest sector in India’s economy, and many global FMCG giants have set up locally incorporated subsidiaries in India to tap on the local market. The sector was worth $110 billion in 2020 and is set to double in size by 2025.PharmaceuticalsAccording to projections by OECD, India’s pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow 232 percent from 2017 to 2030, driven by tailwinds including rising incomes, improving healthcare infrastructure, and crucial government policies.India currently accounts for 20 percent of global pharmaceutical exports and 30 percent of the US’s generic drug imports. It is worth noting that India has the largest number of pharmaceutical units (over 200) located outside the US and approved by the US FDA.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

While global demand has remained weak, Acharya expects it to improve in the fourth quarter of FY24.Talking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Acharya shares his outlook on demand and prices and explains why the company has trimmed its FY24 capex to Rs 18,000 crore from Rs 20,000 crore planned earlier. Edited excerpts of the conversation:Net profit in Q3 FY24 has grown five-fold year-on-year, but it has dipped on a sequential basis. Tell us about these numbers.  We had a very strong production performance in Q3. At 6.87 million tonnes, this was the highest production at JSW Steel, including at our Ohio operations. It grew by about 8 percent quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) and 12 percent on a year-on-year (YoY) basis. Our sales at six million tonnes on a consolidated basis were slightly lower — 5 percent lower quarter-on-quarter — but still 7 percent higher on YoY basis. The primary reason for the drop in sales was lower exports because the global markets were weaker. So the export volumes were lower. That saw a drop of about 20 percent. And imports into India impacted retail sentiment and resulted in some general destocking. The retail sales were lower. However, our sales to institutional OEM (original equipment manufacturers) and industrial customers were at their highest in this quarter. Automotive sales, renewable sales, and our tin packaging sales were at their highest ever. So we saw a growth of almost 8 percent quarter-on-quarter in our OEM industrial and institutional sales overall. Our core focus is that, and that continues to remain strong. Automotive, as I said, was the highest in this quarter. We see that going forward into the next quarter, it will be a seasonally strong quarter. Internationally, steel prices have started moving up on the back of elevated raw material prices. And we will see some part of that reflected in the Indian market in the coming months.Steelmakers like JSW Steel and Tata Steel are riding on the strong growth in the domestic market. What’s your outlook on demand in India going forward, and will it get impacted given that this is an election year?In Q3, imports rose by 16 percent, while exports fell by a similar 16 percent. We had a net import of 1.2 million tonnes, which ate into the domestic incremental demand quarter-on-quarter. But having said that, I think we now see better traction in the January-March quarter with respect to volumes, both from an international perspective as well as from a domestic perspective. There may be a blip during the election quarter, which may come in the next few months. But directionally, we do not see any change in the capex spend or the focus on manufacturing that the government has undertaken. We expect the momentum of India’s economic growth, as well as the steel consumption growth, to remain strong in the medium term as we go into this decade.After your Q2 results, you had warned about steel being diverted to India because the demand was strong here. Given this backdrop and the fact that the Ministry of Steel has said that they are not looking at increasing the import duty on steel, are steelmakers concerned?Despite a weak global environment, India is doing quite well. And it's today the bright spot among major economies in the world; our steel consumption reflects that. And we have seen very strong growth for nine months of this year. Our consumption is at about 100 million tonnes with a growth of close to 15 percent. Some part of our demand was lost to imports. Typically, trade gets diverted into India because of a weak global market, and we need to be wary about that. The Indian steel industry is investing in capex to meet the demand of the country in the years to come. The government will probably need to look at the imports and take some measures to restrict unfair trade. As long as the trade is fair and the pricing is fair, it's fine. But if it's unfair trade at predatory prices, we should be wary and take steps to control it.Is this one of the reasons why you have reduced your capital expenditure plan for the financial year from Rs 20,000 crore to 18,000 crore?There is no change in our focus on capex. Steel demand in India last year was 120 million tonnes. This year, we expect the steel demand to be in the range of 134-135 million tonnes, which means 14–15 million tonnes incremental growth. If we look at even an 8-10 percent consumption growth year-on-year, every year we'll be incrementally adding this 12-15 million tonnes of demand in India. So, the capacity in India should be able to meet the domestic demand, and we are quite focused on that. And our capacity expansion is on track at Vijayanagar and Bhushan Power & Steel Limited (BPSL). We will be completing our expansions of 6.5 million tonnes this year and another 1.5 million tonnes next year to reach about 37 million tonnes by FY25. The capex would get passed on to the next financial year; it is just a timing issue.Is there greater pressure to control costs for businesses like yours given the weak global demand? How are you managing costs, and is there a plan to secure raw materials to keep a check on costs? In this last quarter, we saw a cost increase because of higher coking coal and iron ore prices. But we were able to balance that out with a better blend in terms of coking coal in our mix.We have been awarded three new mines at the auction in Karnataka, which will also go on stream in FY25. We are also ramping up our Orissa mines. On the iron ore side, we'll look at options that make strategic sense in terms of being closer to our locations and continue to bid for them. On the coking coal side, while we are improving our blends and looking at using leaner mixes in our coking coal coke ovens, we continue to scout for assets internationally and domestically to improve our overall coking coal securitisation. And these two remain our focus areas as we go into the next few years.You were also looking at a stake in Canada's Teck Resources but it was acquired by Glencore. What went wrong, and what is the learning?No, nothing really went wrong. We were a strong contender for Teck. However, I think Glencore has taken a call to look at 77 percent of the asset, and Teck and Glencore have agreed to proceed on that basis. However, we remain engaged in our focus on acquiring coking coal mining assets in international and domestic markets, as I said. We are looking at Australia, Canada, and Mozambique for newer assets as well, and we are in talks with some. Our focus is on domestic coking coal. As I said last time, we have two mining assets, which we are trying to commission as soon as possible. We will continue to look at more domestic coking coal assets to improve our blend and our raw material security in coking coal.We are discussing a few assets, but nothing concrete as of now. We will come back to you when we have something clearer.There's a buzz in the market that you are not really looking at sourcing coking coal from Russia on concerns that that may probably make exports to Europe a little bit of a challenge. What is your stance on it?We have a basket that is quite diverse in terms of our coking coal or metallurgical coal procurement from across the world. We have Australia, Canada, and various other locations from which we procure coking coal, including some from Mozambique. We procured some from Russia as well for certain specific goals, which we have been doing for many years. That continues. We do not see any challenges with the mix that we are having in the blend. What we are doing continues, but we are not trying to enhance further coking coal sourcing from Russia as of now. Russian imports account for a small percentage.JSW Group has announced that it is acquiring MG Motors. There may be some synergies with JSW Steel. Is there any plan to leverage that? Our foray into the automotive space with a focus on electric vehicles (EVs) is being done by group companies, and that's a different business. JSW Steel will not be directly involved in that. As we progress into the joint venture and look at completing it closer to time, we will look at what synergies are there between MG Motors and JSW Steel. It could be specifically with respect to supplies of steel for their production of vehicles.We are almost at the end of the financial year. Should we expect any M&A-related announcements from JSW Steel, in particular for the rest of the financial year? No, we don't see that happening. Nothing is on the cards."

While economic trade-offs stay challenging amid reducing fiscal impulse to growth, the policy prerogatives and spirit will not be derailed.Although the risk of competitive populism has abated at the central level, we do expect few relief measures for the rural/farm/welfare sector.Interim budget a non-event, yet an important policy signalling toolThe upcoming budget, being interim in nature, would likely to be a non-event as far as big-bag announcements, new tax or spending pitches are concerned. However, it will still set the stage for policy choices ahead and will be watched out for pace of fiscal consolidation and policy priorities on capex and non-capex spend.We expect the policy direction and prerogatives to remain largely similar to recent budgets, as the trade-offs remain between nurturing the growth recovery and diminishing fiscal space with challenging debt dynamics. Besides, improving intersection of politics and economics implies that political capital is no longer as compromised around the election cycles as perceived.Click Here To Read All Budget Related NewsSteady consolidation ahead: FY25 GFD/GDP poised to tighten to 5.4 percent versus 5.9 percent in FY24Amid various push and pull, FY24 GFD/GDP could just about balance at 5.9 percent as budgeted. The positives buffers such as (1) robust tax collection, (2) super-normal RBI dividend, (3) mild capex cuts (4) expenditure jig etc, would offset (1) higher payouts than budgeted on food, fertiliser subsidy, (2) miss on ambitious divestment targets, (3) lower nominal GDP growth. GFD is gross fiscal deficit.For FY25, we model steady consolidation of 0.5-0.6 percent and see GFD/GDP at 5.4 percent. The scope of too populist looks to be bleak amid moderating tax revenue growth and high committed revenue expenditure (revex) and heavy market borrowings and of course the nature of interim budget.The asset sale print will likely remain below Rs 50,000 crore, while the RBI dividend would be viewed closely. We assume a 10.5 percent nominal GDP growth. A more aggressive nominal GDP assumption in budget could make government balances look optically better.FY25E Capex/GDP to rise further to 3.3 percent; Revex focus on rural, welfare spendingThe Centre’s Capex/GDP ratio will likely rise to 3.3 percent - almost 1.6-ppint  higher than pre-pandemic ratio, even as capex growth may normalize to sub 15 percent. The capex focus will be continue to be specifically on roads, railways, housing, and rural/urban infrastructure. Even as Centre may further extend capex incentives to states, the capacity for states to spend may be nearing its limits.Capex/Revex mix will further improve. Revex/GDP will also ease to 11.2 percent vs 12.0 percent in FY24 and focus will likely be on welfare, rural, and MSMEs. The major subsidy burden may hug Rs 4 lakh crore, with extension of the free food scheme to be offset by mild declines in fertilisers and oil subsidy outlays.Tax buoyancy to lose vigor but tax base stays strong; non-tax revenue stream to easeWe expect gross tax/GDP ratio to stay steady at 11.4 percent after a robust tax buoyancy in FY24 across segments. India's fiscal profile has become structurally healthy, amid better tax compliance, and resilience in domestic growth. We do not expect any major announcements for tax mobilisation and rationalisation, however some tinkering around the new concessional tax regime may not be fully ruled out.Separately, non-tax revenue would still be healthy led by RBI dividend amid consistent FX sales, but may fall short of last year’s bumper surplus. Regarding conventional divestment, the windfall gains may face pressure from stake sales of government's large holdings, which are mainly concentrated in commodity companies and utilities sector.Net market borrowings elevated at Rs 11.5 lakh crore; Gross borrowing may range Rs 15.2 lakh croreWe expect FY25 net borrowing to be around Rs 11.5 lakh crore (Rs 11.8 lakh crore in FY24) - 65 percent of total fiscal funding versus 67.4 percent in FY24E. Heavy reliance on NSSF (more than 25 percent of GFD) will continue, as deposit rates have barely moved meaningfully in last one year.Gross borrowing would be Rs 15.2 lakh crore, assuming (1) no switch or rollover takes place for G-sec papers redeeming in FY25, (2) no direct re-investment proceeds by the RBI in FY25 of its maturing G-sec bonds.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

And China continued to struggle with its policy, resulting as an outlier economy amid the post-Covid global economic recovery.Despite all the odds, global markets stood their ground amid the scepticism. The Nasdaq 100 delivered a spectacular 54 percent return for CY23, the S&P 500 was up 24 percent and even Europe was up 19 percent despite least expectations from its stagnating economies.Also read: Do's and Dont's for traders to protect from big losses on Budget dayOutside the US, the growing economies of Asia, excluding China, bounced back sharply, with 20-percent-plus returns in most markets. China was the sole disappointment with the Hang Seng ending deep in the red, for a third consecutive year (overall, the fourth consecutive year in the negative territory).Our own Nifty, too, ended with a respectable 20 percent return, while the broader domestic market held out a bigger promise, with the midcap and small cap indices gaining 45-55 percent.Where does that leave us now? What should we expect from 2024? Is 2024 going to be a repeat of 2007-2008, or are we headed into a structurally stronger and longer phase of growth?Well, there’s no point trying to guess the near-term swings or mood of the markets, as history has time and again proven most people wrong when they try to predict too near into the future. What may be appropriate is to assess the ground situation and figure out an appropriate way forward.A slowing global world but accelerating earnings: A constructive view on global equitiesThere’s no doubt that the global economy is slowing down, with the burden of the ‘higher for longer’ interest rates dragging down demand and growth across the western world. The US Fed just delivered a partly dovish policy in December, acknowledging that the restrictive monetary policy had restrained economic growth while bringing down inflation. However, the Fed still appears to maintain a balanced and data-dependent approach and will most likely cut rates by 75 bps in total during CY24, starting May. The rate cut cycle in the US is expected to extend over the next couple of years.Also read: LIC’s proposed stake buyout in HDFC Bank ‘well-timed’, has limited downsideThe European Central Bank is also expected to pivot starting May, followed by a less dovish Bank of England sometime in the second half of CY24.So, while the turnround of the rate cycle suggests a decelerating global economy, there’s a silver lining in the earnings cycle, which is seen bottoming out, especially in the US. A gradual recovery in earnings through 2024, coupled with a benign US dollar, makes way for a constructive outlook on global equities, especially developed markets. Emerging Markets are likely to benefit from a friendlier macroeconomic environment towards the second half year of 2024.Domestic Equity markets: Cautious in the near term, but structural drivers make Indian markets stand outWe expect India’s macro to stay robust - highest GDP growth among G20 nations, continued fiscal consolidation and curtailment in government debt/GDP, and a stable INR being some important indicators.Overall, we continue to remain constructive on the Indian equity markets, driven by a continuation of momentum of the earnings cycle and strong domestic liquidity, coupled with the comeback of FPI flows. Markets could be volatile in H1CY24, as debates persist around the US hard versus soft landing, timing of the first rate cut by the Fed, India’s general elections outcome, and as fundamentals catch up with slightly elevated valuations.With markets creating new highs amid a favourable economic and earnings outlook, staying out of the market completely may not be advisable; however, prudent optimism with better risk management may be required, e.g., buying into the market on potential ‘dips’ along with some rotation from the expensive segments (mid/small caps/momentum) into the large caps/large midcaps.Prefer large caps over mid capsMost of the segments (consumption and investments) are trading at ‘fair/rich’ valuations, while financials continue to trade at ‘attractive/reasonable’ valuations. Additionally, mega-caps have underperformed large caps, mid caps and small caps. We prefer large caps/large mid caps versus small/micro caps which are vulnerable to big drawdowns in case of change in sentiment and/or liquidity.BFSI theme: The Banking and Financial Sector is on a firm footing, and also provides valuation comfort. In CY23, while the earnings growth in Financial stocks was quite strong, the sector underperformed the Nifty. In CY24, earnings are expected to moderate from the high base, and while concerns persist around rate cycle and macro uncertainties, the structural story for Indian banks is becoming even stronger, with well-capitalised balance sheets that have been adequately provisioned. Valuations are attractive, both in absolute and relative terms.Rural recovery, finally: Data indicators associated with the rural economy saw some green shoots in late CY23 with robust 2-wheeler sales. Besides, CY23 saw a ~50 percent YoY jump in housing, and the outlook on housing/construction remains positive, which augurs well for unskilled/low-skilled jobs and the rural economy. Higher MSP and supportive rural schemes in an election year can further aid the revival of the rural economy.Manufacturing capex: This continues to be a longer-term structural investment theme, as the economic transformation is under way. In FY24, we have seen an uptick in capex across sectors such as cement, pharma, chemicals, telecom, food & beverages and metals & mining. The Government has already set the ball rolling by undertaking long-term capex across key areas such as transmission, clean energy, railways, Make in India and defence indigenisation until FY30, which provide a strong addressable market for capital goods.Indian Fixed income looks attractive for the next couple of yearsFixed income markets have started pricing in rate cuts by the US Fed, but the rate cut cycle in India is expected to be shallower, given the robust domestic growth and higher-than-target inflation. Rate cuts in India will likely follow those in the US.On the whole, Indian fixed income looks attractive across maturities, given the flat yield curve. The government’s adherence to the fiscal deficit target is expected to lower the pace of growth in G-sec supply. Further, the inclusion of Indian bonds in the JPMorgan EM Bond Index is likely to attract passive flows of $20-25 billion in a phased manner, starting June, along with some discretionary inflows.Duration strategies could benefit from MTM gains when markets start to price in rate cuts, which are expected in H2CY24.On the other hand, liquidity in the banking system is expected to remain tight in H1CY24, which will keep money market rates high, as the RBI will aim to contain inflation by maintaining tight liquidity conditions. This provides the opportunity to investors to earn attractive yields in short term instruments, such as ultra short duration funds, commercial papers, etc.The credit environment is expected to stay favourable, given expectations of robust economic growth. Private capex is expected to pick up in FY25 as capex recovery is expected to gain momentum amid rising capacity utilisation levels and increasing exports/import substitution opportunities. Corporate bond issuance is on the rise and could lead to some widening of spreads.Overall, this year is expected to be beneficial for fixed income investors, as we get ready for the rate cycle to reverse.GoldGold stood out in CY23, with a 13.1 percent return in USD and 15.4 percent return in INR terms, thanks to INR depreciation. In fact, over the past 3 years, Gold in USD terms has delivered sub-optimal returns (less than 3 percent), while Gold in INR terms has delivered an annualized return of 8 percent, aided by the strong INR depreciation of 4.4 percent p.a. against the USD.3-Year annualized performance of GoldGold experienced bouts of volatility in CY23, due to shifting expectations of US monetary policy and its impact on the US economy (hard landing or soft landing), some bank failures as well as geopolitical events.The strong central bank purchases of Gold, which have become a bit structural, have supported Gold prices at higher levels. This, along with geopolitical events, may keep Gold in the reckoning; however, to some extent, gold (speculative) markets have lately been pricing in a sharper slowdown and a possible rapid reversal of US monetary policy, which is not a likely scenario. And there are no signs of a return of safe-haven seekers; this may continue with above-average interest rates and a resilient US Dollar, and may necessitate a near-term Cautious view on Gold.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Hence, if the index manages to hold the momentum, 21,850-22,000 is the area to watch out for on the higher side, which can give the confirmation to the start of a higher-high-higher-low formation, whereas on the other side, 21,600-21,500 is expected to be the near-term support area for the index, experts said.On January 29, the BSE Sensex rallied 1,241 points or 1.8 percent to 71,942, while the Nifty 50 surged 385 points or 1.8 percent to 21,738 and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts.

Reliance Industries surpassed its previous record highs of Rs 2,792 level and achieved fresh record highs of Rs 2,905 level which keeps the tone positive for the stock.Parabolic Sar dots has started to form below the price which is also suggesting that short term bias is bullish.

At close, the Nifty was up 1.8 percent or 385 points at 21,738.Short-term trend in the Nifty turned positive as it broke out from a downward sloping trendline, adjoining the highs of January 16 and January 23. The Nifty also closed above its 11-day and 20-day EMA (exponential moving average) suggesting a bullish trend reversal.In the options segment, we have seen aggressive Put writing at the 21,500-21,600 levels. This level coincides with the 5, 11 and 20-day EMA which are placed at 21,540, 21,565 and 21,534, respectively. Therefore, we believe that on the downside, 21,500-21,600 levels would act as a strong support.Traders are advised to accumulate longs in the Nifty with a stop-loss at 21,500 on a closing basis.There is an unfilled gap in the range of 21,850-21,970 which can act as an immediate resistance for the Nifty. Moreover, in the options segment, we have seen aggressive Call writing at the 22,000 level.

The pharmaceutical company is slated to release its third quarter (Q3) earnings on January 30.The drugmaker is expected to report a net profit of around Rs 1,383 crore, up 12 percent from Rs 1,237.90 crore recorded in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, according to an average of estimates of nine brokerages.Revenue is expected to record a marginal 4 percent on-year rise to Rs 7,030.90 crore, dragged by weak sales from the domestic market and price erosion in other key products in the US. However, the contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid is expected to remain stable, offsetting the loss of revenue from other segments.The pharma major had posted a topline of Rs 6,789.80 crore in the year-ago period.Among the brokerage estimates collated by Moneycontrol, JM Financial rolled out the most bearish growth projections for Dr Reddy's Q3 performance, while YES Securities was the most optimistic.Revlimid contribution remains steady, others not so muchThe generic version of the cancer drug Revlimid will continue to remain the star contributor to the drugmaker's US revenue for yet another quarter, with analysts estimating its contribution to come to around $100 million for Q3. However, lower sales of Ciprodex (used to treat ear infections) due to an unfavourable seasonality effect and Suboxone (used to treat opioid addiction) due to high price erosion are likely to weigh on the overall revenue growth in the US business.Also Read | Cipla shares rally 8% to hit 52-week high on strong Q3 earningsStill, JM Financial believes that a ramp-up of the company's recently acquired Mayne portfolio should support incremental growth in the drugmaker's base business in the US to reach $279 million in Q3.Tepid domestic growth may spoil moodThe company's India business is likely to report mid-single-digit on-year growth in Q3, adversely impacted by a sporadic acute season during the quarter. Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities predicts a mere 7 percent on-year growth in Dr Reddy's India business due to a weak acute season and lost sales from divested brands.Dr Reddy's had divested nine dermatology brands to Eris Lifesciences in the last quarter of FY23.Margins to remain stableWith a sustained contribution from the high-margin Revlimid, analysts expect Dr Reddy's operating margin in Q3 to remain stable year-on-year (YoY). On that account, Kotak Institutional Equities pegged 2 percent on-year growth in the company's consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) at Rs 2,100 crore, with the EBITDA margin expanding 20 basis points (bps) sequentially to 29.1 percent.Going ahead, brokerages also believe that the drugmaker's commentary on its US base business and margin trend will remain the key monitorable, especially at a time when the contribution from Revlimid is expected to gradually taper off through the coming fiscal.Also Read | Cipla tumbles 3% after Samina Hamied steps down as VCDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, large scale adoption of the nascent technology of Gen AI is yet to be seen, said chief executive officers of the top IT companies while speaking to Moneycontrol at the recently concluded World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The broad consensus that green shoots are perceivable on the horizon by the who’s-who of the IT world assumes significance as these companies have struggled in the past couple of quarters with tepid demand leading to muted quarterly performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty in their key markets and the fear of recession had led clients to put a cap on IT and discretionary spending.“I definitely see signs of green shoot,” said Rishad Premji, Executive Chairman, Wipro, further saying, “I want to be sort of sensitive that it's green shoots… (and) as I look out over the last few weeks, certainly things seem to be opening up a little bit more.”For October-December, the IT services company reported a fall in net profit, which is the fourth consecutive quarter of fall in profits.India’s largest IT company, Tata Consultancy Services’ Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director (MD) K Krithivasan said he sees optimism and clients wanting to do more. Asked about a timeline on when discretionary spending would return, Krithivasan said although it's too early to tell but “sometimes when you're not having a bad news is good news.”He further said the company would more or less have a clear view of client’s annual technology budgets by the middle of the January-March quarter. “Budget is no longer that sacrosanct… as the customers see more opportunity, they are willing to recalibrate the budget, invest more or dial down,” Krithivasan said, while speaking to Moneycontrol on January 17.Clients usually prepare their annual tech budgets during the start of the year, which is indicative of the change in spending when compared to the previous year.Initial calculations suggest that budgets have remained the same as last year, Krithivasan said.HCLTech’s CEO and MD C Vijayakumar also joined in unison, saying he sees a sense of optimism on a number of areas. He said Davos 2024 seems to be filled with technology conversations, more than any other year that he has attended so far.“Everybody is navigating a phase of uncertainty and change at the same time,” said Cognizant’s Chief Executive Officer Ravi Kumar S. “In the last 40-50 years, only very few times, people have navigated periods of change and uncertainty together.”Ravi Kumar said clients are looking at more cost-out deals, which is another broader trend the IT industry has been witnessing. The savings thus generated, he said, will be deployed for integrating AI into enterprise landscapes.Gen AIIn the gathering of business leaders and other prominent personalities in the Alps, the tech titans were seen sharing a blend of enthusiasm for Gen AI, and also being cautiously optimistic for it.Generative AI refers to a class of AI models and systems that are designed to generate content, such as text, images, audio, or even video, similar to what a human might create, relying on learned patterns from extensive data rather than explicit programming.India’s second-largest IT company Infosys said clients are charged up about Gen AI and the type of change that it can make for their businesses.However, the company did not see any change in actual buying in Q3, CEO and MD Salil Parekh said while speaking to Moneycontrol at the World Economic Forum in Davos on January 18.“There are some use cases, which are very significant, huge benefits that they can get,” Parekh said. Adding that there was a lot of focus on cost, efficiency, and automation programmes in the December quarter.Parekh said there are some use-cases in generative AI where the benefits are incredible such as customer service, software development, and knowledge areas. “My sense is, as the economic environment also improves, people will look say let's start big programs on that,” he said.“Generative AI is a fundamental change in technology and we are fortunate that we are in somewhat of a leadership position,” Parekh said.If Infosys believes it is in a leadership position, HCLTech says it is playing a very important role in navigating through the uncertainties of a client’s journey in adopting of Gen AI. “I think there is optimism on what the technology (Gen AI) can do, but there is also a lot of uncertainties and the associated risks with some of the adoption of some of the technologies,” said Vijayakumar. “So I think that's driving a little bit of caution… So there is cautious optimism.”But what's driving this? Vijayakumar said multiple factors are at play here, “but the way they translate to clients is they need to get more efficient, they need to reduce costs, they need to bring in hyper-automation.”However, IT companies face another challenge while transitioning prototypes into production-grade work. “When you actually apply AI to consumer-grade work, it's relatively easy. When you apply to enterprise grade work, it is hard,” said Cognizant’s Ravi Kumar.’Nonetheless, all eyes will be on when demand bounces back and the fructification of generative AI into meaningful revenue, going forward.Also read: Wipro, Infosys, Cognizant CEOs shrug off poaching concerns"

Click here for the full listOutlook for January 30Aditya Gaggar Director of Progressive Shares:Today's trade belonged to the Energy segment especially giants i.e. Reliance and ONGC. After commencing the week on a strong note around its crucial resistance of 21,500, the Index kept on compounding its gains in the presence of follow-through and finally settled at 21,737.60 with gains of 385 points.Barring FMCG, all other sectors ended the day in green with Energy and PSU Banking being the top performers. In one go only, the Index has breached its multiple hurdles (21,500 & 21,700) and formed a strong bullish candle on the daily chart; however, we assume that Nifty may witness some pressure around 21,750.It is premature to say but there is a possibility of forming an Inverted Head & Shoulder pattern. The immediate resistance is placed at 21,850 while the downside seems to be protected at 21,570.Jatin Gedia – Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas:The Nifty opened gap up and continued to inch higher throughout the day to close in the green up ~385 points. On the daily charts we can observe that the Nifty has breached the previous swing high of 21750 and hence violates the downtrend as the lower top lower bottom formation has been violated. During the fall the Nifty held on to the support of the 40-day average placed around 21200 which shall now act as a lower boundary during the consolidation phase.On the upside, the Index can continue its pullback towards 21913 which coincides with the 78.6% fibonacci retracement level of the fall from 22124 – 21137 and also the gap formed on the 17th January, 2024 in the range 21850 – 22000 shall act as an immediate hurdle going ahead. The daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover however it has reached the equilibrium line and also prices are not showing weakness which can lead to a range bound action over the next few trading sessions. Considering the above parameters we shall change our outlook on the Nifty to sideways and the broad range of consolidation is likely to be 21200 – 22000.Bank Nifty is in the process of retracing the fall it has witnessed from 48300 – 44500 and hence the pullback can continue till 46000 – 46200 from short term perspective. On the downside 45110 is the crucial support from short term perspective.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

One analyst advises traders to enter into trade during the last hour of the market during budget day","As we step into the first week of February, all attention is on the interim budget slated to be announced on the 1st. Traders are often enticed to take positions before the budget. Yet, the recent volatility signals inherent risks that one must heed before engaging in pre-budget trades.For derivatives traders looking to position themselves ahead of the Budget, here are some key do's and dont's to avoid being caught on the wrong foot:Keep track of volatility while making strategies: Tina Gadodia“An iron butterfly, or calendar spread, or put ratio back spread is an ideal safeguard against negative outcomes,” says Tina Gadodia of Quantsapp.“Going into the budget, I would advise traders to hedge positions. The first recommendation is to avoid trading events. It's not something to be played out for, considering the high volatility. India VIX, for instance, was around 15.5, a few days back, and it came back to 13. These spikes are expected as we move towards the election period,” said Gadodia.“If someone still wants to trade, an iron butterfly or calendar spread is recommended. However, these strategies should be executed in a limited manner. Normally, people who take positions for the budget are well aware of the event. They hedge positions or implement hedge strategies, like the put ratio back spread, which was popular in earlier budgets. This strategy safeguards against negative outcomes and protects the portfolio,"" she said.Gadodia highlights that a prudent trader rarely takes a naked position during budget day. These events are known well in advance, and traders who take positions are aware of the risks. They look for opportunities and use the information to their advantage.""Look at the implied volatility. It plays a crucial role in determining which type of strategy to use. For example, if the implied volatility of the Nifty  is around 15 -15.5, an iron butterfly can be considered. If someone wants to hedge a portfolio, a put ratio back spread can be useful. This strategy involves selling one ATM put and buying two OTM puts. Since the budget is on the first of February and the expiry is on the 29th, the time decay doesn't impact the strategy much. Institutions and HNIs (high net-worth individuals) and those holding large portfolios, prefer using a put ratio back spread to hedge themselves for this event,"" she added.Avoid taking over-leveraged positions, Stick to large-cap stocks: Avdhut Bagkar""It is advisable to avoid taking over-leveraged positions to evade the uncertain volatility that is expected on budget day. Such occasions in the past have dented the confidence levels when resilient swings are noted,"" Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives and Technical analyst, StoxBox, said.“Large-cap stocks are better suited to mitigate risks during volatile sessions and recoup any losses during the following days. While their beta is in correlation with the index momentum, the underlying positive bias aids in making sound decisions,” he said.Enter during the last hour of the marketBagkar suggests taking entries during the last hour of the market as it would clear the clouds and provide an insight into the impact of the budget. One can expect the formation of major levels that could dictate the next course of action.Option writers need to look at proper risk management: Chandan Taparia“Volatile swings could be seen, so it is better to trade in option strategies. Option writers need to look at proper risk management. Long positions can be hedged for the time being. One can focus on a strong selective sector to generate alpha,” said Chandan Taparia, Vice President and Head of Derivative Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.Avoid naked option writing: Soni Patnaik of JM FinancialRemain hedged with strategies, such as a bear put strategy. Avoid naked option writing as the budget day is a big event and can see volatile swings. Negative triggers could witness one-sided movements, Soni Patnaik, Assistant Vice President, Derivatives Research, at JM Financial, said.Also Read: Budget 2024: What rollover data suggests for pre–budget positioning, and key tips for tradersRefrain from aggressive directional strategies: Sameet Chavan, Angel OneConsidering the recent developments, it is advisable to refrain from adopting any aggressive directional strategies.

So, intra-day traders and small investment players should avoid risks on the particular day. Trading with discipline is the key, so working with a calculated risk appetite is important.

And we do not plan to have any additional exposure at the moment,"" said Raju.He added that the bank had allocated Rs 1,000 crore to boost its technology over the next few years, of which it has already spent Rs 700 crore.Edited excerpts from the interview follow:What is Canara Bank's current exposure to airline companies? What are its plans about lending to the sector in future?Except the Tata group, we don't have any exposure  to airlines companies. And we do not plan to have any additional exposure at the moment.Canara Bank clocked good numbers in Q3FY23-24. How sustainable is your growth trajectory?We’ve demonstrated  consistency and steady growth in the last few quarters. But the interest on deposits is rising. Under these circumstances, maintaining such numbers is a challenge for everybody. We are monitoring the situation very closely and are also very cost conscious, that's why we don't want to grow the topline at the cost of the bottomline.So, we are maintaining an equilibrium between these two things, and we are sure that next quarter too we will see a credit growth of about 12% year-on-year (YoY).What is your outlook on the credit-deposit ratio?In Q3FY23-24 we have focussed more on credit because we have already achieved what we wanted with a CD (credit-deposit) ratio of 75 percent. Two years back, our CD ratio was 68 percent. We were losing a lot of interest income. That's why we have taken a call to grow credit more than deposits.What is your outlook on your corporate loan book?Regarding corporates, we have decided that the RAM sectors (retail, agriculture, and MSME) will comprise 40-60% of our corporate loans. I'm sure during the current quarter (Q4FY23-24), while my corporate loans will grow 10 percent, RAM will continue to grow at 14.5%. We are running several campaigns  this quarter to mobilise retail term deposits and CASA (current and savings accounts).Also, we have launched a mobile app for corporates. Because our mobile app for retail is so successful, there was a huge demand for something similar from the corporate sector.What is your spending on technology?We have budgeted Rs 1,000 crore to be spent on technology over the next few years, of which we have already spent Rs 700 crore.On January 1, 2024, we launched our state-of-the-art Centre of Excellence for D&A (data and analytics). It’s  the first of its kind among public sector banks,  as well as the industry. We are seeing the return on investment from investment in technology.We are creating a virtual branch, a virtual customer service area. We are training our staff to interact virtually.What about cybersecurity?We have already appointed a Chief Risk Officer. From April 1, 2024, we will also have a separate cybersecurity department. So far, cybersecurity has been  part of  the risk department. The cybersecurity department will be headed by a Chief Security Officer (CSO), who will report directly to the whole-time director."

After negotiations, Disney’s India assets are now valued at around $4.5 billion, compared to its earlier demand for $10 billion, the report said. The combined entity aims for an $11 billion valuation, with Disney holding a 40 percent stake.Reliance Industries will own 51 percent, and the deal is set to be finalised in February, Bloomberg reported. The collapse of the $10 billion merger between Sony and Zee Entertainment removes a potential major competitor, the report added.The RIL stock gained 12 percent in January following positive commentary on peaking capex and strong retail performance. Analysts have raised target prices and maintained their ratings.In the fiscal third quarter, the company’s capital expenditure (capex) fell 22 percent to Rs 30,100 crore from the preceding three months. This drop was due to reduced spending by Jio after completing its 5G rollout across India and lower capex in its retail business due to limited space expansion.“We expect retail capex to decline Rs 15,000 crore on-year in FY24 and fall further in FY25. Also, Jio’s headline capex should fall Rs 30,000 crore in FY25, helping improve FCF (free cash flow) abating concerns on rise in net debt,” Jefferies India said.According to analysts, there was a slowdown in capex in the December quarter as the company neared completion of its 5G rollout. RIL has reported negative free cash flow over the past three years, primarily due to telecom spending. With the fading of these expenses and an EBITDA run rate of $20 billion annually, RIL is expected to generate positive free cash flow for the next two years. Although net debt slightly increased in the three months ended December 31, quarter-on-quarter, due to the repayment of other capex liabilities, analysts predict a downward trend in the future, supported by reduced capex and an improved EBITDA run rate.“We raise our FY24-26 EBITDA by 2-5 percent led by Jio (higher tariff hikes), retail (recent robust performance), and O2C (3Q beat).

Joe Biden’s record low popularity ratings get a lot of attention, yet leaders across the developed world are in a similar predicament to the US president — they have rarely been this unpopular.

I track leaders’ approval ratings in 20 major democracies, using leading pollsters such as Morning Consult, Gallup and Compolítica. In the developed world, no leader has a rating above 50 per cent. Only one country (Italy) has seen its leader gain approval in the 2020s. At...

While there are expectations of a continued thrust on capex and infrastructure, analysts believe the budget might also include measures to boost welfare spending and the rural sector.The rural sector has been distressed as a result of near-term challenges such as poor weather conditions, climate change, and inflationary pressures, said Arvinder Singh Nanda, senior vice president, Master Capital Services. “Tax relief measures and a few announcements to support agriculture and the rural sector can be expected while maintaining the capex push,” he added.Also Read: Budget and Markets: Will FM add fuel to the rally in industrial stocks?Additionally, since the budget is occurring ahead of the general elections, analysts expect that it will include some populist measures to woo voters.

Hence, fertiliser stocks, including Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals, Coromandel International and GNCF, could see a rally in the coming months.

Tata Trent’s Zudio, Reliance Retail's Yousta, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail Ltd's Style-Up, and Shoppers Stop's InTune have all entered the value apparel sector in the last one year, planning to sell a pair of jeans or a dress at prices lower than street-side shops. Yousta, for instance, sells all items at Rs 999 or less.The value retail market in India, excluding food and grocery, is anticipated to see a substantial increase, reaching $170 billion by 2026, compared to $111 billion in FY23, according to a recent report by global consulting firm Wazir Advisors.This segment is projected to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 percent between 2023 and 2026, surpassing the anticipated 10 percent CAGR of the overall retail sector. The overall retail sector is expected to reach $1,219 billion by FY26.Analysts noted that even though the big four metro cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata) comprise the bulk of the value retail market, companies are gradually targeting the tier-2 and tier-3 cities. “As the aspirations of the middle class are improving, companies are targeting the smaller towns with value retail offerings.” said Preeyam Tolia, a consumer and retail analyst at Axis Securities. Analysts noted that even though the big four metro cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata) comprise the bulk of the value retail market, companies are gradually targeting the tier-2 and tier-3 cities.Zudio’s headstartAnalysts noted that Zudio, backed by the Tata Group, had a significant headstart in the market and has successfully established a robust foothold and deep understanding of the customer base.Zudio's growth has been swift, witnessing a substantial increase in the number of stores, from 268 in Q2FY23 to 411 in Q2FY24. The brand had just 57 stores in the calendar year 2020. The store count has seen a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 64 percent from CY20 to CY23.“Their efficient sourcing and cost-control mechanisms enable them to offer competitive prices while maintaining high-quality products,” said Vinit Bolinjkar, head of research at Ventura Securities.“Furthermore, their focus on private labels affords them greater control over product design and pricing strategies, contributing to their distinct market position,” he added.The Youtsa challenge to ZudioDespite the current positive outlook for Trent, Tolia pointed out that Reliance Retail's Youtsa poses a formidable competition to Zudio.Toila emphasised that unlike Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail or Shoppers Stop, Reliance Retail can easily adopt the strategies employed by Zudio. “Reliance Retail can easily become a dominant player as they have the muscle power in the market,” he added.Reliance Retail has successfully secured a funding of Rs 15,314 crore from prominent global investors, such as KKR, QIA, and ADIA. At Rs 83,063 crore, the company reported a robust 23 percent on-year jump in gross revenues for Q3FY23. The expansion strategy for Youtsa involves the opening of approximately 200-250 stores in the  next two years.Nevertheless, industry experts have observed that replicating the Zudio model, especially for players like Reliance Retail, will require a considerable amount of time.The Zudio approachAccording to Tolia, Zudio has effectively adopted the fast-fashion approach, drawing inspiration from Zara. “If you look at Zudio’s products, they bear a resemblance to Zara,” he added. The brand refreshes its inventory every 15 days, a strategy that resonates well with customers.Additionally, Zudio stands out by manufacturing its brands in-house. Toila pointed out that having too many brands under one roof poses a challenge for companies like ABFRL, as it becomes challenging to regularly update their inventory, resulting in less appealing designs. “ABFRL has also tried to get into a lot of segments like ethnic wear, which made the brand lose focus,” said Tolia.Analysts noted that Shoppers Stop’s Intune is relatively new compared to Zudio. The brand has 10 stores and plans to add 14 more in 4QFY24. “The aggressive expansion plan of 164 stores by FY26E could be a key lever for growth and re-rating, going forward. However, it will be crucial to expand design and private label merchandising capabilities to enhance the value proposition.” said Motilal Oswal in a post earnings note.To safeguard its leading position, Zudio must maintain a consistent offering of trendy, affordable, and high-quality products, said Bolinjkar, and added that expanding physical stores in smaller cities, and investing in digital platforms for an omni-channel approach, are crucial steps to stay ahead of potential competitors."

The long-short ratio is 22:78, with heavy short bets positioned at the beginning of the Feb series.""It is the budget week and implied volatility is expected to spike. Put writing support is at 21,000, while call action is concentrated at the 21,500 and 22,000 strike. ""PCR OI at 0.81 validates the action in calls to be significantly higher over puts. Also, call premiums are almost 1.5 times overpriced over puts. This suggests a relief recovery ahead of the budget. The ATM 21,350 straddle hints at a price band of 21,000-21,700 for the week. 21,150-21,200 is a key support area. Upside targets can be 21,500/21,650. Momentum gains in case 21,500 call writers are challenged,"" added Bhagwat.Bhagwat said the view is still bearish, with a sell-on-rise market until the Nifty slips below 21,700. ""This is a broader view for February. However, ahead of the budget, a relief recovery is possible until 21,650,"" he said.According to Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives & Technical Analyst at StoxBox, ""The Nifty 50 index must surpass the critical hurdle of 21,850 before embarking on a new journey that could reach a new all-time high. While breaching the 21,550-21,450 mark in the last week has dented the positive bias, the following support at 21,000 could provide some respite. The trend remains fragile beneath the barrier of 21,850.""The strength oscillator, Relative Strength Index (RSI), has cooled from the overbought territory, which was noticed since mid-December to early January. It may help the index minimise the slide, Bagkar said.""On the option side, a robust concentration can be evident in 22,000 and 21,000 strike prices, with the 21,800 strike witnessing resilient activity. The index must overcome the 21,800 - 21,850 barrier on a decisive note to scale uncharted territories in the February series,"" he added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The brighter side: inflation could moderate further and, combined with weaker economic growth, could set the stage for an interest rate cut.That’s the sum and substance of what Sonal Varma, chief economist and managing director for India and Asia (ex-Japan) at Nomura, expects for CY24/FY25.Edited excerpts from a Moneycontrol exclusive interview where she details her take on the economy and what to expect in Budget 2024.Watch the full interview hereOutlook for IndiaOur outlook for FY25 and CY24 is that it's going to be a year of a strong start but weak finish. There will be a softening in the growth momentum in the latter half of this calendar year. First, the big push on public capex has been frontloaded, and as the election cycle gets ongoing, there'll be a moderation in public capex awarding activity.Second… urban discretionary demand, which has been quite strong and partly driven by the drawdown in savings, still remains quite strong. There's been some tightening in macro prudential norms in terms of lending by the RBI, which at the margin will mean some moderation in urban consumer discretionary demand.Third, global factors. Our house view is that the US recession is delayed but not denied. In the second half of the calendar, we are looking for the US to slip into a mild recession. If that plays out, there will be some spillover on India, particularly on the services side of the economy.Challenges for consumption, government interventionPrivate consumption has been a disappointing aspect of the composition of India's growth recovery. The rural side of consumption, in particular, has been quite weak. Rural derives income from both farming and non-farming activity, with non-farming activity closely tied to jobs that are being created in construction, manufacturing, transportation and related sectors. On the farming side, the cost of production has been relatively higher compared to the output or the returns that farmers have got. On the non-farming side, job creation is probably not happening at the right pace.When we look at rural wages on an inflation-adjusted basis, real rural wages have actually been quite tame. Typically, if you look at the distribution of savings between urban and rural consumers, the savings rate usually is lower at the rural end of consumers. While urban consumers have higher savings, which they've drawn down to partly consume more, that excess savings or savings is not as much of a buffer for rural India. Terms of trade for the rural economy have been under pressure because of a mix of all of these factors.Also read: Faster-than-expected GDP growth in FY24 driven by government activism: NomuraOver the next 12 months, India’s inflation will gradually fall. Over the last one year, while we've seen core inflation come down, food inflation, which actually has a higher weight in rural expenditure, has been volatile, but mostly on the higher side. On average, we've seen inflation closer to 5.5 percent.Compare that to the next 12 months. If we don't get any major shock around food prices, then on average, inflation in FY24 and FY25 should be closer to 4.5 percent, driven both by sustained moderation in core inflation as well as food inflation. From a real income perspective, some of the squeeze that consumers in the low- and middle-income bucket were facing because of higher inflation should be less of a headwind going forward. And to that extent, consumption demand from those categories should be, at the margin, better for the rural consumer.There's some tightening on credit disbursement, particularly unsecured credit. Jobs in the IT and related space have come off. Thus, there should be some normalisation in urban demand and some rebalancing of consumer demand between rural and urban. Over the next 12 months, on aggregate, consumer demand should be flat to marginally lower compared to the previous 12 months, but broadly stable.We are not expecting any major government intervention at this stage. There are, of course, particular segments of the population that the government wants to focus on – farmers, for instance. And those specific targeted interventions could come through, but not a broad-based consumer focus.Merchant exportsWe went from a period of excess demand post-Covid to excess supply all across the world. And we've seen in a number of sectors, a period of inventory correction cycle which has weighed on goods demand globally.Very high inflation in the developed world has also depressed demand for goods and that has weighed on the global trade cycle. For instance, while the US economy has been resilient and avoided a recession (so far), the goods cycle has gone through recessionary conditions, and that has weighed on exports for a number of big exporting countries, including India.This inventory cycle has played out – now, inventories are more lean across a number of sectors. Inflation is also coming down in developed economies. Real incomes are picking up and you're seeing some stabilisation in goods demand in the advanced economies, which is the reason we think that there are early signs that the goods cycle is bottoming out. For India, that should mean that going forward, we're sort of moving from a period of deep contraction in exports to a period where, potentially, we could move into positive territory.We need to monitor two risks though: one is the Red Sea disruptions on the shipping side, where the economic impact really depends on whether this is a short-term or a more prolonged disruption. It could cause some short-term hiccups on trade. Second is the broad strength of demand in advanced economies. If the US does slip into a recession in the second half, which is our house view, this export cycle could end up being more short-lived.Also read: Nomura sees 12% rise in Nifty this year on strong macros, easing inflation, better earningsFiscal deficit and capexWe think the government will meet the 5.9 percent fiscal deficit target. The big focus for the government in this budget will be on specific electoral categories: more allocations on rural, agriculture, for farmers, for women, for youth, low cost housing, etc.Capital expenditure has already been ramped up quite significantly over the last two to three years. We think that the momentum on capex will be maintained in FY25, but at a slower pace compared to the last three years.And therefore, on net, we think FY25 fiscal deficit target should be brought down to around 5.3 percent of GDP, about 60 basis points in terms of consolidation, with the objective to get to the medium term target of 4.5 percent in FY26, or at least as close to it as possible.In terms of capex, for FY25, we're building in roughly around 15 percent in terms of increase compared to FY24, where it was set at over 30 percent.What to watch in Budget 2024The takeaway from this budget is going to be how the government balances pre-election pressures versus fiscal consolidation. All this increase in allocation towards low-cost housing, farmers, women, youth, etc., is obviously going to come at a cost plus. We need to maintain the pace of public capex because private capex hasn't picked up. And in that environment, we still need to consolidate our fiscal finances. The government's ability to balance that while ensuring fiscal consolidation should essentially be the main takeaway.Possibility of RBI rate cutsThe biggest positive for India is the moderation in core inflation that we have seen – 3.8 percent in December. For the next 12 months, we do think core inflation will stay below 4 percent as well. And headline inflation will also be averaging around 4.5 percent. If that happens and if growth moderates in the second half of 2024, that will be the trigger for the RBI to move. Because implicitly, at 6.5 percent, the real policy rates will be close to 200 basis points, which is on the more restrictive side.For us, the RBI will sequence the monetary policy exit starting with a change in stance to neutral, which could come through as early as April, followed by actual repo rate cuts, which we are currently building in from August onwards. And for FY25, cumulatively we have 100 basis points in cuts. So that should take the repo rate down to 5.5 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

This internationalisation of Indian equities also solves two complaints global investors had: interface with tax authorities, and currency conversion friction","The 2020 Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan announced by the Union finance minister set in motion a long-awaited reform of allowing direct listing of securities by Indian public Companies in permissible foreign jurisdictions. This was a long-standing ask of Indian startups and companies as they wished to tap global pools of capital and increase liquidity for their shares.The Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Corporate Affairs on January 24, 2024, announced two key amendments to Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and Companies Act, 2013, to facilitate this reform. Through this reform, Indian public companies (including unlisted companies) can offer their securities on permissible International Exchanges, these being the India International Exchange and NSE International Exchange in GIFT IFSC (GIFT International Financial Services Centre).Red Carpet For Global InvestorsA key benefit of this is the internationalisation of Indian equities, solving two key challenges:1. Interface with Indian authorities2. Currency conversion frictionMany global investors still view the process of investing in Indian equities as being fraught with friction, despite changes over the past few years. There exist several pre-conditions before they can begin to invest. A key precondition is the need to obtain a PAN (Indian tax ID). The reputation of the Indian tax authorities across the world remains unparalleled, fueling investor reluctance to get a PAN and expose themselves to the Indian tax authorities.Though misplaced, this perception is deeply entrenched amongst several overseas compliance professionals who hold tremendous sway over investors. While this is changing over time, GIFT IFSC tackled this head-on by dispensing with the need to have a PAN to participate in that jurisdiction.Furthermore, investors with no other sources of income in India besides income from GIFT IFSC do not have to file a tax return in India. The icing on the cake is the tax holiday for gains made from exchanges in GIFT IFSC. This level of tax treatment is unprecedented in recent times and will increase the attractiveness of securities listed on GIFT IFSC exchanges.In addition to this, the ability to buy and sell in US Dollars will make accounting and asset allocation much simpler. The drag on returns created by currency conversion to and from Indian rupees doesn’t exist in GIFT IFSC, allowing it to compete with other global financial centres.Direct listing also removes the tracking error that exists between ADRs/GDRs and Indian equities. Depository receipts are instruments traded on exchanges such as the NASDAQ, NYSE, etc which derive their value from underlying equities. This model results in tracking errors between the value of the equity and the Depository Receipt. Direct listing circumvents this framework and allows for direct participation.GIFT IFSC: Gateway To Global Indian EquitiesAs an international financial centre, the thesis behind GIFT IFSC is to attract foreign investors. Thus, it logically follows that Indian residents as per FEMA are not allowed to participate in the listing in GIFT IFSC.This entails a change in strategy for Indian companies, who can tap the domestic market via India and the international market from India and GIFT IFSC. For those who believe in a global story, there is no compunction to list in India and GIFT IFSC. An Indian company can choose its jurisdiction of listing and tap investors selectively.Though this may not be how Indian startups presumed direct foreign listing would occur, it is a step forward. The framework under FEMA allows for more foreign jurisdictions to be allowed in the future, keeping the door open for direct listing on exchanges such as NASDAQ, NYSE, LSE, etc.Many Indian startups who flipped overseas wishing to tap these exchanges now want to return to India to tap the local exchanges.The Gateway to India is in Mumbai, but the gateway to global Indian equities is moving to GIFT IFSC.Siddarth Pai is Founding Partner, 3one4 Capital.

The Red Sea rampage spells good news for crude prices, but traders grapple with the crisis. Lockheed Martin might slash a portion of its workforce for a stronger bottomline. All this and more in this edition of World Street...Clamping DownThe Chinese securities regulator said it will fully suspend the lending of restricted shares effective from Monday, in policymakers' latest attempt to stabilise the country's stock markets following recent sharp falls, reports Reuters. A string of supportive policies by Beijing, including a deep cut to bank reserves helped lift Chinese stocks off five-year lows early last week but they retreated again on Friday, reflecting deep investor pessimism over the outlook for markets and the shaky economy.Geopolitical WatchA British warship, the HMS Diamond, repelled a drone attack on Saturday from Yemen's Houthi group in the Red Sea, British officials said. ""Deploying her Sea Viper missile system, Diamond destroyed a drone targeting her with no injuries or damage sustained to Diamond or her crew,"" the Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Sunday. ""These intolerable and illegal attacks are completely unacceptable and it is our duty to protect the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea,"" it added.FarmvilleThe French government is considering further help for the country's farmers, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said that as their nationwide protests to demand better pay and living conditions showed no sign of abating. Farmers in France, the European Union's biggest agricultural producer, complain they face unfair competition from rivals in more lightly regulated countries. They have set up roadblocks on major roads over the last week.Chip WarsThe US is expected to award billions of dollars in subsidies in coming weeks to top semiconductor companies, including Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, to help build new factories in the US, the Wall Street Journal reported. The forthcoming announcements aim to kick-start manufacturing of advanced semiconductors that power smartphones, artificial intelligence, and weapons systems, the WSJ reported.Job CutsLockheed Martin will cut 1 percent of its jobs over the course of the year in a bid to cut costs and streamline operations, reports Reuters. The reductions will impact positions across all of its business and enterprise operations, a company spokesperson said, adding that the cost-cutting actions will include hiring freezes and voluntary separations. The Maryland-based defence contractor employs 122,000 people worldwide, according to its website.Oil SurgesConcerns about fuel supply propelled oil prices up by 1 percent, triggered by a missile hitting a fuel tanker operated by Trafigura in the Red Sea. The outlook for Russian refined products exports is grim, as several refineries are undergoing repairs following drone attacks. ""With oil tankers linked to the U.S. and UK now under threat of attack, the market is likely to reprice the risk of disruptions,” said ANZ analysts.Building New BeginningsThe building materials giant Holcim revealed plans to separate its entire North American operations through a New York flotation, potentially assessing the business at $30 billion. The company also introduced a new chief executive. ""We're going to do a full capital market separation of our North American business, so we will list 100 percent of the business on the New York Stock Exchange,"" said the CEO.Currency WoesAnticipating a potential 4 percent decline by June, Moody's Investors Service predicts that the Bangladesh Taka may weaken if restrictions on the currency are relaxed. This move is seen as a potential boost to the nation's depleting foreign-exchange reserves.

This would mark a progression towards a more flexible exchange-rate regime."
487,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-market-outlook-a-rebound-likely-ahead-of-the-interim-budget-12133471.html,Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | A rebound likely ahead of the interim budget ,"January 29, 2024 08:27 AM IST","The Nifty has experienced a two-week decline, with weekly momentum indicators shifting towards the sell side. While the Indian markets have seen selling pressure, global markets have been strong","Dear Reader,Indian markets were operational for only three days last week, with two concluding in the red, causing the benchmark indices to decline by one percent. The week started on a negative note due to a report suggesting that the market regulator SEBI was pushing for increased disclosure by Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs). To comply with SEBI's guidelines, FPIs must divest Rs 1.5-2 lakh crore over the next six months, potentially impacting future foreign investments.Fortunately, the regulator clarified that there were no immediate plans to implement such norms. This clarification came at a crucial time as the finance minister prepares to present the interim budget. The upcoming week may witness a positive start due to the clarification, but the true direction will only become evident after the interim budget presentation.In the last decade, interim budgets have witnessed minimal volatility, and the market has consistently closed flat on the day. Given the low expectations for this year as well, the likelihood of a lacklustre day is high.A Bounce LikelyThe Nifty has experienced a two-week decline, with weekly momentum indicators shifting towards the sell side. The Nifty may further decrease towards the 20400 level, near the 20-weekly moving average (WMA).In the short term, sentiment indicators are entering the oversold zone, suggesting the possibility of a rebound. A bounce back to the 21500-21700 range (current level 21352) is plausible. However, selling pressure is expected to resurface, considering that the market has not yet undergone sufficient correction, and there is room for further downside.The average swing at 18 is just below the minimum oversold zone, raising the question of whether a short-term bounce is imminent in the market. This rebound, lasting a few days to a week, may revolve around developments related to the interim budget. Source: web.strike.moneyThe interesting data this week is that FIIs completely gave up on the long side on expiration. The month started with FIIs at 80,000 contracts long, but after the expiry on Thursday, FIIs are now short over 100,000 contracts.This means that the market will keep falling till more shorts get added. Previous market bottoms saw slightly bigger short positions before a market rally. However, markets have also bounced from the current FII short position of 100,000 contracts, as seen in the chart below. The market can go up before coming down again. Source: web.strike.moneyThe 40-day A/D ratio has been coming down but very slowly. Compared to the past, the decline is minimal and barely reflects a decent price correction, indicating the strong momentum in a broad-based rally. But a correction is not over till that pattern reverses. Many more stocks need to fall, and the ratio needs to be closer to where bottoms occurred in the past. Source: web.strike.moneyIndices and Market BreadthDomestic indices ended the truncated week lower, losing around one percent. The media index was the worst-performing sector, falling 10.03 percent, thanks to the Sony-Zee deal breaking off. This was followed by the real estate sector, which fell 4.46 percent. The banking index continued to fall as HDFC Bank was under pressure and lost 2.59 percent.The smaller indices' performance has been mixed. The small-cap index fell 0.7 percent, and the mid-cap index fell 1.78 percent.Global MarketWhile the Indian markets have seen selling pressure, global markets have been strong. The MSCI World equity index, which tracks shares in 49 nations, gained 1.21 percent, hitting its highest level in almost two years.US markets continued their move higher and gained nearly one percent during the week. European markets had a much better week, with the Euro Stoxx 50 gaining 4.19 percent. This was after the European Central Bank (ECB) signalled that it could cut rates by April. ECB chief Christine Lagarde said the money markets are pricing an almost 85 percent chance of a first quarter-point rate cut in April.Asian markets also closed the week higher, especially China and Hong Kong, the top performers after the Chinese central bank released cash reserves to be held by banks, releasing one trillion yuan ($139.45 billion) in the economy.Japanese market closed marginally lower week despite inflation in Tokyo cooling below two percent for the first time in over a year and a half.The US market is up for six straight days after the economy reported better than expected growth.Stocks To WatchAmong the frontline stocks showing strong upside momentum are Trent, Siemens, Godrej Properties, Thomas Cook, IRB, LIC Housing Finance, Sun Pharma, Tata Motors, NHPC, and JB Chemicals.Stocks showing weakness are Moldtek Packaging, UPL, Hind Unilever, Atul, and Bata India.Cheers,Shishir Asthana"

Reacting to daily events is injurious for long-term portfolio and also hampers wealth creation, says Devang Mehta","Devang Mehta, Director-Equity Advisory, Spark Capital Private Wealth Management, says capex-oriented sectors, energy efficiency and discretionary consumption are among the themes that look interesting not just in the run-up to the budget but also for the long term as the Indian economy enters the next expansion cycle.With India due for elections in April-May and the US later, 2024 will be an eventful year for the global economy when inflation, interest rate moves and geopolitical tensions will also be closely tracked.In an interview to Moneycontrol, Mehta, who has spent more than 23 years in wealth management, says investors should make volatility a friend instead of worrying about it. Edited excerpts:Do you expect the government to give infrastructure sector a further push in the interim budget?A full budget for the financial year 2024-25 would be presented in July by the new government elected after the April-May general elections. However, there are a lot of expectations, especially because this will be the current BJP led government’s last budget presentation before the nation goes into elections.Infrastructure spending as a percentage of GDP increased from 1.13 percent in FY 2019-20 to a budgeted estimate of 3.3 percent of GDP in FY 2023-24. The government has been prioritising capital spending, especially for railways, roads and defence.On the other hand, over the past two years, spending on urban development and energy as a share of GDP has declined. The government is expected to divert some of its expenses towards improving the port and shipping; energy, especially green and sustainable energy; and urban infrastructure. In this budget, the government’s focus should be on the transition from carbon-dependent to energy-efficient policies.Also read: Budget and Markets: Will the FM spook the F&O party by hiking securities transaction tax?Do you see the government taking more measures to boost rural demand?To generate jobs in the rural sector, the government may announce some incentives to increase investment in rural infrastructure and extend the scope of production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes to sectors such as chemicals and services. One of the ways could be higher spending on building rural infrastructure or providing incentives that improve cash flow.Broadening the scope of PLI schemes to sectors such as chemicals and services can create demand for more manufacturing. The Union government may allocate higher funds for social sector schemes in the forthcoming interim budget, as increased tax buoyancy may provide it with enough funds and will in turn help the rural economy.The agriculture sector growth is expected to decelerate to 1.8 percent in the current fiscal year from 4 percent in 2022-23, according to advance estimates of GDP. In an effort to push the agricultural economy ahead, the finance minister may announce some measures that will boost consumption demand.Also read: This investment professional expects no major surprises in budgetDo you see any change on the tax front in the interim budget?As I said, this would be more of a vote-on-account rather than the full budget but there are still expectations for an increase in the tax rebate to Rs 7.5 lakh. Such an adjustment would offer much-needed relief, particularly to middle-income taxpayers.Individuals falling under this income threshold, post standard deductions, would enjoy exemption from income tax, potentially encouraging increased spending and investment, thereby contributing to economic growth.However, it is imperative for the government to not solely rely on tax rebates. While a higher tax rebate benefits individuals, a holistic approach, including structural reforms and sector-specific policies, is essential for overall economic stability and advancement.Which are the sectors to focus on in the run-up to the interim budget?Themes and sectors related to manufacturing, PLI schemes, capex oriented sectors like infra and capital goods, motion management, energy efficiency, discretionary consumption and healthcare seem interesting not only on the anticipation of budgetary announcements but also as India gears up to rise into the new orbit of economic expansion.Do you see the expects the Nifty to decline below 20,000 before resuming the upmove? Which are the triggers, including related to the banking sector, that the market is looking forward to?We have entered 2024 seeing a dream rally across markets, multiple sectors and businesses. The sheer velocity of the rally in the broader markets warranted a bit of caution and hence this correction seems to be healthy. The correction primarily stems from sustained selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who have offloaded equities worth Rs 27,830 crore over the past five days.After such furious rally, there has to be gravity and that will bring in the money lying on the sidelines. There is lot of money waiting to come in via different routes, be it MFs, ETFs or even direct equities. A few percentage points correction here and there will ensure that both equilibrium and sanity are maintained and will ensure longevity of wealth creation.This is a year full of events. Our own general elections, US elections, the trajectory of inflation and hence interest rates across the globe, geopolitical tensions across regions. Volatility will prevail in the shorter term but for long term investors, its best to make volatility a friend rather than worrying about it. Reacting to daily events is injurious for the health of long term portfolio and such distractions will never let wealth creation fructify.Which are the sectors that you would bet on in case of a major correction?Capital goods, infrastructure, manufacturing and allied industries, select BFSI and consumer discretionary and themes related to premiumisation are certain sectors where we would want to keep adding on dips.Is the worst over for HDFC Bank? Will the stock consolidate from here?HDFC Bank still accounts for 19 percent of incremental deposits created in the banking system as of December end and this is true for the last nine months and the last few years. The bank expects deposit growth to be influenced by the environment, where banking system liquidity is in a significant deficit, resulting in higher rates.Like HDFC Bank’s deposit-creating ability, its ability to create quality is also best in class. In the next two or three quarters, NIM can see some improvement. Its return on equity was above 17 percent before the merger with HDFC but has since declined to 15.8 percent as of December end. Also being an over owned stock across institutional investors, short-term corrections and probably a bit of consolidation is bound to happen when there are disappointments.Having said that, HDFC Bank has been a rock-solid franchise over the last couple of decades. They are just two quarters into the merger, will need sometime to shine through and return to its winning ways.Do you see any major risk to the banking and NBFCs?The RBI’s recent policies are targeted at controlling growth in specific categories of personal loans. The RBI governor has raised red flags over the high growth in certain segments of retail credit. He said overall credit growth is broad-based but certain categories of personal loans are “recording very high growth.” He added that the RBI is monitoring credit growth rates in these categories and advised banks and NBFCs to strengthen their risk management.The RBI has done exceptionally well in staying ahead of the curve and tightening the screws before time, learning from past lessons. The old adage “precaution is better than cure” is what the RBI has been following and that probably will keep the banks and NBFCs in good shape in both good and difficult times.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Expansion into new ventures like pumped storage and green hydrogen further contributes to the positive outlook.As per Bloomberg's survey of two analysts, the projected net profit for the period is Rs 4,930 crore, with the anticipated revenue reaching Rs 44646.80 crore.NTPC plans to boost coal production and add 7 GW of power in FY24, with less than 1 GW from renewable energy. This expansion encompasses projects like Barh-3, North Karanpura 2 and 3, Patrharu, Kurja, Hydro, and NREL. In FY25, NTPC aims to add 6 GW through projects such as Patratu 1 and 2, Tapovan Vishnugar, and Solar. The company has raised its standalone capital expenditure plans to Rs 31,100 crore by FY25 and Rs 35,000 crore by FY26, compared to Rs 24,500 crore in FY23.Analysts predict NTPC will benefit from the growth in renewables and the increasing demand for thermal capacity during peak shortages. The company is also investing in green hydrogen and carbon capture, offering strategic alternatives.With accelerated coal-based additions, NTPC has commissioned a 3.3GW of renewable capacity, with 7.3GW under construction and a 10GW project pipeline. Private sector involvement in adding coal-based power capacity is limited.

Economists mostly predict June, but traders are pricing the risk of a March move at essentially a coin toss, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.The U.S. dollar index, which tracks the currency against six major peers, was content to stick to the middle of its range of the past two weeks at 103.52, little changed from Friday.Long-term Treasury yields declined about 3 basis points to 4.1316%, putting them near the centre of their range since Jan. 18.Last week's U.S. data continued the ""remarkable run"" of not-too-hot and not-too-cold economic indicators, pointing to a soft landing and a May start to policy easing, Commonwealth Bank of Australia strategists wrote in a client note.Odds for a March move should continue to be priced out this week, leading the dollar index to test 104 and bond yields to rise ""modestly,"" they said.The dollar was little changed at 148.06 yen on Monday, while the euro was flat at $1.08465 and sterling was steady at $1.27055.In energy markets, Brent crude futures climbed 83 cents to $84.38 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose 78 cents to $78.79 a barrel.Gold added 0.23% to $2,023.39.Cryptocurrency bitcoin ticked up to $42,165."

Net sales are expected to drop 18% YoY and 6% QoQ to Rs 102991.50 crore. EBITDA for the quarter is projected to decline around 60% QoQ to Rs 6194.90 crore, as per seven analysts polled by Moneycontrol.","State-run oil marketing major Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) is expected to see a sharp sequential decline in earnings for the December quarter, primarily because of a significant inventory loss, normalisation of GRMs, and a slightly lower marketing margin.Anticipated net profit is around Rs 3,303.80 crore, down around 70 percent QoQ, with a YoY increase of about 30 percent. Net sales are expected to drop 18 percent on-year and 6 percent on-quarter to Rs 10,2991.50 crore. EBITDA for the quarter is projected to decline around 60 percent QoQ to Rs 6,194.90 crore, as per seven analysts polled by Moneycontrol.Analysts expect BPCL to report a Gross Refining Margin (GRM) of $8.5 per barrel for the upcoming quarter, down from $18.5 in 2QFY24. This projection is based on a core GRM of $11.5, a crude inventory loss of $3.0 on each barrel, crude throughput at 9.3mmt (a 1 percent QoQ decrease), and marketing sales volume at 12.8mmt (a 2.4 percent QoQ increase).Additionally, the anticipated decline in auto fuel gross marketing margin to Rs2.8/ltr in 3QFY24 (compared to Rs3.3 per litre in 2QFY24) and an expected product inventory loss of $1.2 a barrel contribute to this outlook.Analysts said retail margins remained strong in the quarter, with estimated diesel retail margins at Rs 2 a litre (Rs -6 YoY, Rs -1 QoQ). Analysts also expect a 5 percent on-year growth in domestic retail sales. However, Singapore GRMs fell 14 percent YoY and 43 percent QoQ due to weak global product cracks. Analysts anticipate GRMs to remain flat both QoQ and YoY. Additionally, BPCL reported high inventory gain in Q2 due to an 11 percent QoQ increase in crude prices.JM Financial predicts that Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) are likely to face a substantial crude inventory loss of $3-5 per barrel in the upcoming quarter. This is attributed to a QoQ decline of $16 in the Brent crude price (averaging $78 a barrel in December 2023, compared to $94 in September 2023). Additionally, analysts anticipate an inventory loss of $1.2 a barrel in the marketing business.Due to a moderation in diesel cracks and a reduction in Russian crude discounts, the reported gross refining margin (GRM) for OMCs (adjusted for inventory loss) is expected to sharply decline to $6-8.5/bbl, in contrast to the $13.3-18.5/bbl reported in 2QFY24.The weighted average auto-fuel gross marketing margin for OMCs has also decreased to Rs2.8/ltr in 3QFY24, down from Rs3.3/ltr in 2QFY24, and below the normalized margin of Rs3.5/ltr. As a result, analysts project a significant 50-70 percent QoQ decline in OMCs' EBITDA for 3QFY24, compared to the record-high earnings reported in 1HFY24.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The closing above its previous high and record high closing indicate strength in the stock.","""The Nifty IT index has been forming higher highs and higher lows, keeping the overall tone positive. Crucial level to observe is 37,000. A breakthrough above this level can take prices higher towards the 39,000 levels,"" Ashish Kyal, CMT, founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors, says in an interview to Moneycontrol.Overall tone for IT will remain bullish for months, he believes. And one can use dips to buy stocks from this sector, he advised.Kyal, with more than two decades of experience in capital markets, suggested five budget picks, including AIA Engineering, Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT), and Strides Pharma. Excerpts from an interview with Moneycontrol:Do you think the rally is done in IRFC and Rail Vikas Nigam which were the top gainers in the current month?Both IRFC and RVNL has shown near-vertical rise but reversed sharply on January 23. These stocks are still overbought and further profit-booking is possible in these stocks after the Union Budget.Prices are already discounting positive outcome from the Budget session and can show dramatic reversals. So, one should now be cautious on these stocks as long as lifetime high levels remain protected.Also read: Stockology: Watch for divergence indicators in a volatile trading weekAre the charts telling you that the selling pressure is done in Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Polycab India?For ZEEL, after recent decision to call off the planned merger with Sony, Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEEL) experienced selling pressure and closed the last week with loss of 29.47 percent. The downtrend is evident on weekly chart. The formation of strong bearish candle and closing below its previous crucial support level of 175 is confirming the bearish bias.On the daily chart, after significant sell-off on Tuesday price is trading within the range since past two trading sessions which is Rs 171–157 levels. RSI (relative strength index) is trading near the 23 level, which is indicating that prices are in the oversold area, so a short-term pullback is possible but use that as an opportunity to sell.Also read: Market Action: Six IPOs to hit Dalal Street, 10 listings lined upIn short, ZEEL is bearish. A breach below Rs 157 can drag the prices lower towards the Rs 150 level with hurdles near Rs 185 on the upside.For Polycab India, after news of the Income Tax (I-T) department detected ""unaccounted cash sales"" of about Rs 1,000 crore, the stock tanked 23 percent on January 11 which has changed the overall structure to negative. Formation of a bearish candle suggests that the short-term bias is bearish.After strong selling pressure price is consolidating in range of Rs 4,550 – 3,800 since the past two weeks. The price broke its previous support of Rs 4,800 which is also confirming the bearish bias. Ichimoku cloud is indicating weakness in price cloud has formed near Rs 4,750 which can act as a potential resistance.In short, Polycab is sideways to bearish. A breach below Rs 4,050 can drag the prices lower at the Rs 3,650 level, whereas a break above Rs 4,550 can result into a deeper pullback towards Rs 4,700.Do you expect the Nifty 50 to consolidate with support at the 21,000 mark in the coming weeks? What are the chances of the index hitting 20,500 -20,000 levels?The Nifty has been forming lower highs and lower lows after touching a lifetime high levels near 22,124 on the upside. This was also near the target we have mentioned in earlier interviews. After forming the high, there was a sharp reversal on the downside.Over the past few days, we can see rangebound movement. On the downside, a breach below 21,210 might open the downside possibilities to 20,800, followed by 20,500 levels. However, on the upside, the major hurdle is near 21,720 followed by 21,840 levels. A move above this will suggest upside reversal.For now, the index is trading at crucial juncture before the Budget. Prices are failing to show momentum on either side. After a strong run-up until January 15, short-term correction is a healthy sign for the overall long-term positive market trend. In a nutshell, the 21,210 support will be a crucial level to be watched over the short term.Do you think the 44,000 is expected to be crucial support for the Bank Nifty for coming weeks?Bank Nifty has been major contributor to the downside. It has been leading the fall and the Bank Nifty showed one of the steepest declines from January 16, 2024. Over the near term, 44,300 remains an important support for this index and if this is breached, we can expect the downside momentum to increase for a move to the 43,600 levels.On the upside, 46,200 is going to be a short-term resistance. A move above this is must for meaningful pullbacks. As long as the same is intact, the banking index can remain under pressure.Is the Nifty IT creating rounding bottom pattern on the weekly and monthly charts? Does it mean that completion and breakout of the same pattern in coming weeks or months can generate robust returns in following weeks or months?In December 2023, Nifty IT has shown strong breakout of consolidation pattern. In our past interviews we have mentioned bullish stand when the index was near 32,000 levels and since then prices have rallied by nearly 15 percent to close last week at 36,500 levels.The IT index has been forming higher highs and higher lows keeping the overall tone positive.Crucial level to observe is 37,000. A breakthrough above this level can take prices higher towards the 39,000 levels. Overall tone for IT will remain bullish for months ahead and one can use dips to buy stocks from this sector.Which are you top 5 budget picks and why?AIA EngineeringAIA Engineering has recently witnessed a breakout from the range Rs 3,300 – 3,800 levels, with the price managing to close above the range. The stock has broken out from an attractive technical pattern which is ascending triangle pattern. A follow-up action beyond Rs 3,910 level, price can reach towards uncharted territory setting new record highs for target of Rs 4,200.Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT)After a long consolidation phase, FACT broke the range in previous trading session. The price is trading above the breakout from ascending triangle pattern, signalling a bullish bias. The closing above its previous high and record high closing indicate strength in the stock.The technical indicator MACD aligns with the breakout, which is confirming the positive outlook. The increasing volume also suggest bullish momentum likely to continue in next few trading session. In short, FACT is bullish for move to Rs 960 as long as Rs 780 remains intact on downside.Strides PharmaSince December lows, there has been an impressive 44 percent rally in Strides Pharma, followed by a 16-day consolidation period.

Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer TV Narendran expects India demand to remain strong, and Netherlands to start turning around from the current quarter. The UK operations, which have been bleeding thus far, will be restructured over the next nine months, and only after that there may be an improvement in operational performance, Narendran said.Narendran dismissed accusations of “gross hypocrisy” as Tata Steel shut its UK  blast furnaces citing a cut in carbon emissions, even as it prepares to open a new one in India.Commenting on Tata Steel’s plans to reduce debt by $1 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, Narendran said, “Even if we don't achieve it, we won't abandon it.”Edited excerpts of his conversation with Moneycontrol follow:Q. Talking of operational performance, your India EBITDA was quite strong in Q3, while the UK and Netherlands reported losses. What’s the outlook for the Europe business?In the Netherlands, traditionally we've been EBITDA-positive, cash-positive, but we've had four or five bad quarters for two reasons. One, we had a cold rolling mill upgrade that we undertook towards the end of the last financial year, which took longer than expected to ramp-up; that impacted the product-mix.Two, in the UK we took down blast furnace 6  in April for relining, and that too took longer than expected; this accounts for 50 percent of our production there. We were operating for most of last year on one blast furnace, and we were using steel slabs we had made the previous year when energy prices were high. These were high-cost slabs. Now the blast furnace relining is complete and it should be back in production next week.Over the next few quarters, we'll go back to the production levels that we expect in the Netherlands. Gas and electricity prices have dropped, so we expect to have the Netherlands back in positive territory next year.The UK has been challenging as the spreads are low, which is what we’ve experienced over the last 12 months. That’s why we are restructuring the UK operations, which will take place over the next 9 months or so. Only then will you see an improvement in operational performance in the UK. But you could see an improvement in financial performance, in the spreads, because the spreads in Q3 were the lowest in a very long time in Europe. In the last few weeks, we've started seeing the spreads and the prices in Europe go up because of the geopolitical situation around the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.Q. Domestic revenue was marginally higher on improved volumes and steel realisations. Infrastructure spend has been at full throttle in India. With India getting into election mode and concerns over a slowdown in projects due to the code of conduct kicking in, what’s your outlook on India?I think we're quite positive about India. Steel consumption has grown at over 10 percent in the last calendar year. For the last two-three years, we’ve said that we expect steel consumption in India to grow faster than the GDP because India is moving from consumption-led growth to investment-led growth, which is more steel intensive. So, steel consumption should typically grow at 1-1.3 times the GDP growth rate. We've seen that happen and we stand by that.While there may be a brief slowdown in some construction activity, there is still a lot of investment going on in railways, gas pipelines, and many other areas. Private sector investment is also starting in warehousing and  in industrial buildings. Auto has been strong. Normally during elections, you see a pickup in commercial vehicles, etc., because they’re used to move people around. So, we are quite bullish about India.Q. And what kind of demand growth are you expecting in India? Also, on the prices front, do you expect some more price revision in the rest of the financial and the calendar year?I am conscious that if demand has grown 10 percent in the last calendar year, you're working with a higher base. Going ahead, I wouldn't be surprised if India's steel consumption grows at 8-9 percent, assuming GDP grows at 7-7.5 percent. Prices, of course, will reflect what's happening in the international markets. And there's a big China element at play. China production was strong last year. When their production is strong, raw material prices are high. That's why iron ore prices have been in the $125 to $140 range. While coal prices dropped below $300 per tonne, they quickly went up above that.Because Chinese consumption was low, China exported more steel because they produced more than they could consume. When China exports 5 million tonnes per month, we can live with it. In 2015, they were exporting 10 million tonnes a month. Now they’re exporting 8 million tonnes a month. So that's had an impact on steel prices internationally. There is a squeeze between higher raw material prices because of higher Chinese production, and lower steel prices because of higher Chinese exports. But I don't expect China to export 90 million tonnes this year. They are trying to stimulate domestic demand and are not very keen to export lots of steel and leave a big carbon footprint. I expect this will lead to some correction over this year, which will help international prices. And if the demand in India is strong, that should help prices in India. Specifically, we have guided that this quarter, on average, we expect realisations to be Rs 1,000 / tonne less than last quarter for multiple reasons. We will know better after the Chinese New Year.Q. When can we expect some improvement in EBITDA and a turnaround in the UK and Netherlands?You will start seeing a turnaround in the Netherlands from this quarter. Because the blast furnace will be in operation in February and March. Secondly, you will also start seeing better numbers because of lower energy costs from this quarter. The third point is, because of tension in the Suez Canal and Red Sea, a lot of steel which traditionally goes from Asia to Europe is not making its way there. As a consequence, we've seen European steel prices go up by about Euro 30-40 (per tonne) in the last few weeks.Q. You have highlighted in the press statement after Q3 results that the capex plan is on track to clock an output of 40 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2030. Given the weakness in the global environment, and the oversupply, are there concerns that margins may be under pressure once the capacity comes up?The advantage with organic growth is that we can pace it as we want to. We can pace it based on our appetite, balance sheet, and demand. We have all the options available to us.Q. Last quarter you told us that you have not given up on the target to reduce debt by $1 billion in fiscal year 2023-24. Where do we stand on that now? That doesn't look very good. We've not been able to bring it down as much as we would have liked. Our performance in Europe has not helped. Let's see how much better we can do in this quarter. We are committed to debt reduction and deleveraging. We are committed to being very cash-flow focused, but this has not been a good year so far.But we are not abandoning the plan. Even if we don't achieve it, we won't abandon it. We’ll try our best till the end of the year to reduce it from where it is today. But a $1 billion reduction looks very far away now.Q. Tata Steel announced last week that up to 2,800 jobs would be cut as part of the  plans to close Port Talbot’s two huge blast furnaces and replace them with an electric arc furnace. How are the discussions with the different stakeholders coming along?We had an understanding with the government on the basis of which they promised us support. With that, we went to the unions, and shared our plans with them. They shared an alternative plan. We’ve incorporated some of their suggestions in our plans. And kicked off discussions on this new plan last week with the announcement.Obviously, the unions don't like the outcome, because there are jobs at stake, and we are committed to seeing how we manage it in the best possible way. But we are also keen to create a business which is not always standing on the edge of a cliff, always struggling to survive. We want to make sure that at the end of this transition, where we are putting in Tata Steel’s money and the British taxpayer’s money, we have a business which can stand on its own. There is a formal consultation process which will go on for at least 45 days.Q. Tata Steel has been accused of “gross hypocrisy” as it prepares to open a new blast furnace in India, while citing a cut in carbon emissions as the reason for shuttering two blast furnaces in south Wales, costing thousands of jobs. How would you react to that?   We need to understand the context in different geographies. At a broad level, Europe, including the UK, has a carbon tax. Europe has committed to net-zero by 2050. The policies have been brought in. There's a carbon border adjustment mechanism (a tariff on carbon-heavy products imported into the EU).  There is a roadmap, and there is a target that the governments have set on how much carbon they want to reduce by 2030. The steel industry is a big part of that journey. Governments across Europe are discussing with steel companies as to how they can transition. The governments are supporting industry because they need to meet their carbon reduction goals, and without that support, the industry can't transition with their own cash flows. Others, besides us, are also moving away from blast furnaces.Secondly, we've been losing money in the UK, and over the last 15 years, we’ve supported the UK to the extent of about GBP5 billion. So, it is not a sustainable business. There was no support from the government last year and even this year, we'll know from the quarterly numbers how much we've lost in the quarter in the UK. If  we don't do anything, we will have to shut down anyway. What we see is a way forward, where the government is willing to support us and we are willing to put in money. At least we will have an electric arc furnace in the UK, leveraging the fact that the UK is the second biggest scrap exporter in the world after the US. It's natural to use scrap available in the UK  to make steel in the UK, rather than bring iron ore and coal from across the world to make steel in the UK, pay a carbon tax, and lose money.India is a different story. India aims to be net-zero by 2070, not 2050. We don't have a carbon tax in India, and the regulatory framework is different. India is a growing market and we need to build more capacity. If you don't build capacity, you lose market share. We have not said that we will not build any blast furnaces anywhere in the world. We have said that in Europe, both in the Netherlands and in the UK, we will replace blast furnaces with other units in line with regulations. In India, as and when regulations incentivise reducing the carbon footprint and there is gas available, we will switch.Ends"

The Nasdaq declined 0.36 percent to 15,455.36 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.16 percent to 38,109.43 points.For the week, the S&P 500 added 1.06 percent, the Dow gained 0.65 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 0.94 percent.Asian MarketsAsian markets were trading mostly higher on Monday ahead of a slew of GDP and inflation numbers due out from the region this week. Japan's Nikkei was up 0.8 percent, while Kospi index gained 1 percent.US prices rise moderately in December; inflation trending lowerUS prices rose marginally in December, keeping the annual increase in inflation below 3 percent for a third straight month, bolstering expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates this year.But the timing of the anticipated rate cut is uncertain, with the report from the Commerce Department on Friday also showing consumer spending surging at the end of 2023 as Americans splurged on goods and services over the holidays.The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index increased 0.2 percent last month after dropping 0.1 percent in November, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Food prices rose 0.1% and the cost of energy products increased 0.3 percent.ECB leaves key rates unchangedThe European Central Bank froze borrowing costs again on Thursday even as inflation eases, signalling it was too soon to start considering rate cuts.The third consecutive pause since October leaves the ECB's benchmark deposit rate at a record high of four percent, following a historic run of hikes to tame prices that shot up after Russia's war in Ukraine.The pause was widely expected but with inflation steadily slowing and the eurozone economy stuttering, investor attention has shifted to when the ECB might start cutting rates.The ECB's governing council reiterated in its statement that it believed rates are at levels that ""maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution"" to returning inflation to the two-percent target.US economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.3% pace last quarterThe US economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk 3.3 percent annual pace from October through December as Americans showed a continued willingness to spend freely despite high interest rates and price levels that have frustrated many households.Thursday's report from the Commerce Department said the gross domestic product the economy's total output of goods and services decelerated from its sizzling 4.9 percent growth rate the previous quarter.

The charts exhibit a distorted pattern with a 'lower top lower bottom' formation on the daily chart, signaling a bearish reversal.When examined on a broader scale, a 'head and shoulders' pattern confirms a bearish trend. This does not bode well for the bulls, suggesting potential challenges in the short term. The current week is crucial, aligned with the key Budget event, which typically sets the market direction. The Budget week is known for volatility, and considering the above formation we lean towards the bearish side.In this scenario, the levels to monitor are around the psychological 21,000 mark, coinciding with 50-SMA (simple moving average).

The BSE capital Goods Index, a collection of 27 stocks, which includes mid and small caps as well, has rallied 71 percent over the last year.Nirav Parikh, co-founder Molecule Ventures, a Surat-based PMS fund, feels it is a tough call.He told Moneycontrol that the capital goods, which recently came out of a long business downcycle sees a kind of improvement which is surprising even the promoters. “To what extent it can still surprise and what multiples market will be willing to pay is anyone’s guess,” Parikh said.The reason being that the profits many of these companies were reporting in a full year are now coming through in six months because of huge order wins, he said.Parikh’s fund owns companies like Praj Industries, Elicon Engineer, Apar Industries and TD Power.Given the unusually robust order book position, the stocks are quoting at multiples higher than those during the previous peak cycle in 2018.“Let's say we thought that 8 to 10 times EV/EBITDA is what Apar should trade because that was the peak in the previous cycle. It is now trading at 14 times,” Parikh said.Catching the topThe challenge in figuring out if the cycle has peaked is that earnings growth can continue to be strong for some more time as the backlog in the order book is still being executed. One indicator is to watch when profit margins hit historic highs. When that happens, stock prices usually stop reacting to incremental positive developments. But that indicator too has its limits, according to Parikh, as the trend varies across sectors.“If the entry barriers are low for the industry, it's very easy to set up capacity, and supply can come very fast. So, that is relatively easy to adjust. Let's say something like sugar, where you know it's not that difficult to divert the production or something of that sort.Or the BOPP films or BoPET films industry. You have a sense of how much capex has been announced and how much time it will take for the supply to come. For such industries, typically the demand is very linear.So, out there, you have comfort in comparing the historic margins or the previous cycle's high margins,” Parikh said.“But it can get tricky if the sector is one with high entry barriers. There you could see a time correction rather than a price correction. Say for instance, something that’s not exactly cyclical; Balaji Amines and Alkyl Amines. It is a oligopoly kind of market. But the stocks have stopped reacting for the last couple of years now, because margins had hit historic highs,” Parikh said.Watch the priceA tell tale sign that Parikh keeps an eye on is the stock price. “The relatively easy thing is to take feedback from the market because what will happen during an upcycle is that earnings will change, margins will change, and the ownership will change.If you combine all these things over time you will get a sense of how well markets priced a lot of things. And when even with good numbers if stocks stop reacting the way they used to in the past, you get a sense that there is over ownership in the sector. The story is well discovered, and it could be a prudent time to start trimming position,” Parikh said.Likewise, in a downcycle, the time to start buying when stock prices don’t react to bad numbers, as it is an indication that the outlook on the business is getting better.Order enquiriesParikh was early to latch on to the capital goods story and said the indicator he tracks closely is improvement in enquiry levels from clients. Managements usually mention that in their earnings calls.That allowed him to buy into stocks like Praj Industries and Triveni Engineering at attractive prices.“Those were the few companies which clearly mentioned that their enquiry levels were going higher by 30-50 percent,” said Parikh, who manages around Rs 450 crore.“A 10-15 percent increase in enquiries is quite normal. But the moment enquiries go up higher than that, you know things may be changing for the industry,” he said.Parikh cited the example of Praj Industries where the government’s announcement of the advancement of the deadline for ethanol blending did not immediately fire up the stock. But Parikh started building a position when he heard the management say the order enquiries were rising.Taking a callEven if the management say enquiries are rising, there is no saying if the enquiries will actually translate into orders. That’s where one needs to know the promoters’ track record.“Some companies are historically aggressive when it comes to such announcements. So you need to discount what percentage of that will actually translate into order wins. Then there are others who are conservative. If they mention a figure, you can assume that the conversion number will be high,” Parikh said.It’s the promoterBetting on the promoter is key because according to Parikh, the big losses usually come from company specific issues.“The business part typically any normal analyst can evaluate. But a capital loss typically happens when the promoters' intentions are not above the board. Whenever we look at an investment opportunity we also look at how promoters have behaved during a good cycle and a bad cycle, in addition to the standard quantitative filters,” Parikh said."

The 42-year-old co-founder of Surat-based PMS firm Molecule Ventures has been managing investments for over a decade now, initially for friends and family, and later for paying clients. The firm today manages around Rs 450 crore for a little over 200 clients since it got a Sebi registration in May 2021.Here's the excerpts from a freewheeling conversation:Warning signsThe quantity of shares is a good indicator of knowing whether the market is overbought or oversold.In January 2018, at the peak of the (mid and small cap) rally, the average daily shares traded was 46 crore. It fell to 20-25 crore during the bear market of 2019. During the Covid rally, it climbed a high of 100 crore in January 2022 as the market topped out temporarily. After consolidating between January 2022 and Match 2023, the number has been steadily rising and now stands at 145 crore.Junk indexThis volume needs to be viewed in the context of the kind of shares that are rising. We have internally come up with what we call a junk index. It has around 85 stocks with corporate governance issues, and which only participate in the fag-end of the bull market. In March (2023), around 10 percent of the stocks (in junk index) were rising. That number rose to around 40 percent by August. Today 100 percent of the basket is participating.Bearish on chemicalsWe were able to spot the chemical upcycle early in 2013 when companies across the board were expanding their capacities. Two things helped us make the decision. One, the capex was not being funded through equity dilution. Two, even if we were wrong in our call, the downside was limited because the stocks were available at cheap price-to-earnings multiples.What has changed The way it works for any sector is that the leader in the previous cycle will not participate in the subsequent cycle.One, the fundamental triggers would have played out to perfection, and the market would have priced these stocks fully. That is an important factor because the price you buy at will decide the returns you make.Also, a lot of OK kind of companies would have participated in the previous cycle, and many people would have got stuck when the cycle peaked. Say, you have 100 stocks in the chemicals sector. The main traction will happen in, let's say, 10, 15 stocks. That will be in line with a normal market scenario. So, they'll have earnings growth, normal multiples, and returns too will be normal. But because you have too many people owning the shares, every bounce will get sold into. It is the ownership that decides the extent of the move on either sides.Another thing that is different in this chemical cycle is that companies have lined up huge expansion plans, but this time a lot of funding is taking place through equity dilution."

Nevertheless, a decisive breakthrough above 21,500 could propel the index towards 21,700/22,000 in the short term, he said.We have collated 15 data points to help you spot profitable trades:Key support and resistance levels on the Nifty and Bank NiftyThe pivot point calculator indicates that the Nifty is likely to take immediate support at 21,272, followed by 21,222, and 21,141 levels, while on the higher side, it may see an immediate resistance at 21,372, followed by 21,484 and 21,565 levels.Meanwhile, on January 25, the Bank Nifty broken the 200-day EMA (exponential moving average - 44,570) but managed to defend the same for yet another session. The index also defended 44,500 mark at the close, which can be crucial for further downside.The banking index fell 216 points to 44,866 and formed a bearish candlestick pattern with long lower shadow on the daily charts, indicating a smart recovery from day's low.

The bias is in favour of the sellers","Stockology is a weekly column by futurologist Mahesh Gowande. He is the founder and director of Ayan Analytics which has developed ZodiacAnalyst. It is a research software, with time and price charting tools, and it is exclusively used along with technical support.There were three working days in the last week, but Tuesday's (January 23) fall distorted many bullish charts. The following two days gave insight that there is a long way to go for the infra and PSU companies, as expected, and lastly, cement companies are finally showing a bullish pattern after decades, and there can be 50 percent or more gains in many of them. The intra-week movement was much in line with expectations, and there were no surprises.Technicals - We have been bearish on the markets from a short-term perspective and needed confirmations of Nifty target 20,430, which was confirmed last week.Also Read: Budget and Markets: Will the FM spook the F&O party by hiking securities transaction tax?Reducing exposure to small and mid-cap stocks is highly recommended; while the story is not over, it will take some time to consolidate and adjust to the new regimes. The energy sector, commodities, or natural resources, still holds a pretty good upside. The financial service sector is low risk and has much better upside returns in the coming few months; the next is chemical sector stocks.Sell more on the rise, and the breaking of 21,100 with the apparent target of 20,450 and 20,100 within 30 days. Technical analysis is much more beyond resistance and support; technical is being with the smart money, trend following is to avoid momentum indicators; it is more of the Art of Lagging.Also Read: MC Explains | What are Sebi FPI norms and how are they linked to the market fall?Most traders experience losses, with approximately 97.5 percent consistently losing money. Trend-following systems often align with these losing trades. The true skill of an analyst lies in discerning the winners and aligning with them.TimeMap - Interesting phase. The influence of time and human responses are so predictive. We have always believed that the timing of action or execution of investment ideas is critical, as it can improve the performance of the fund or portfolio. TimeMap can reduce the portfolio's risk profile, minimise beta, and enhance the alpha of the fund or portfolio of the investors.The coming week will be volatile; the efficiency of the TimeMap is above 50 percent, which means the movement would be slightly above 3 percent. The bias is in favour of the sellers. Moon's 90-degree aspect with multiple planets affects decision-making; delay leads to frustration, and markets witness fear, uncertainty, and liquidation.

Many chemical companies have already corrected from peaks due to cuts in weak chemical prices caused by the weak Chinese economy,"" says this seasoned investment professional with over 20 years of experience.Considering the trend, do you think the market seems to have formed the top on the benchmark indices now and may be getting into correction mode?The easy gains seem to be out of the system. From here on in, it is likely to be a grind and true market discipline and ability will come to the forefront, especially when it comes to holding onto one's gains when the drawdown comes.What happens in the short to medium term is anyone's guess. The markets may or may not be correct, but they may just consolidate with a time-wise correction.Do you see more concerns on the domestic side than the global side in the coming months that can keep the market volatile?This is the year of elections, with more people voting in 2024 than at any time in history.

At least I hope not.Click Here To Read All Budget Related NewsWhich are the sectors that you want to add to your portfolio if there is a further market correction?We are quite interested in the chemical space. Many chemical companies have already corrected from peaks due to cuts in weak chemical prices caused by the weak Chinese economy.While price recovery is yet to be seen, it becomes a decent value opportunity for investment in good companies with decent valuations. Companies involved in water treatment, solar and construction seem well placed as well.We are also interested in the infra space, which we have been well entrenched in since 2018.

Domestic markets were still under pressure, especially because of poor numbers from a few major players. The Nifty index had a high near 21,750 before closing near 21,200 with a decent loss for the second consecutive week.During past sessions, the benchmark index Nifty found support at 21,150, which then led to a massive rise from there. Interestingly, the index has reversed from the support of a bullish Wolfe Wave formation. Based on the pattern, the index may revisit the 21,700–21,800 zone in the upcoming week if the recent low near 21,150 is not broken. In the worst-case scenario, we anticipate that the index will take support below 21,150, close to the 20,900 zone, where multiple supports are placed and the AB=CD pattern is completed.The 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average 44,570) of the Nifty Bank index has been retested, and we anticipate that this zone will serve as support in the upcoming sessions. Overall, we anticipate a strong rebound in the Nifty Bank index during the February 2024 derivative series if the 45,000–44,000 support holds.Here are three buy calls for short term:HDFC Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,435 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380 | Target: Rs 1,550 | Return: 8 percentSince the last 2 years or so, the said counter has been rejected six times from Rs 1,725–1,750 zone and is currently placed near Rs 1,430 mark. Currently, HDFC Bank has taken timely support near the October 2022 low of around Rs 1,380. Coincidentally, it is 200 DEMA, thus making it a viable buy at the current juncture.The fall from January 17, 2024, to January 23, 2024, has witnessed decreasing volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam. On January 24, 2024, HDFC Bank made a classic Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern accompanied by decent volume, which cannot be ignored as of now.Also, in the hourly time frame, it has managed to generate Bull divergence on stochastic. Based on the technical setup, one can accumulate the said counter in the range of Rs 1,420–1,450 with a stop-loss of Rs 1,380 and a target of Rs 1,550.Rain Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 175.60 | Stop-Loss: Rs 155 | Target: Rs 210 | Return: 20 percentSince the last 2 months or so, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Recently, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative. Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable.Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines. The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars, which indicates bullish bias in the counter.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has given a trendline violation, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 170-176 with an upside target of Rs 210, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 155 on a daily close basis.Note: The Gartley pattern is a Harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, which help traders, identify reaction highs and lows.Greaves Cotton: Buy | LTP: Rs 165 | Stop-Loss: Rs 143 | Target: Rs 200 | Return: 21 percentThe entire 2023 year went by, consolidating around 100–200 DEMA (exponential moving average), followed by recent bear trendline violations (refer to the chart). Also, volume is picking up from lower levels, thus making it attractive at current levels.On the indicator front, the weekly MACD (moving average convergence divergence) has given a bull cross just near the zero line, which further affirms our bullish stance. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 163–166 with a target of Rs 200 and a stop-loss of Rs 143 on a daily basis.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The US economy defied recession calls, closing 2023 with a surprisingly strong 3.3 percent annualized growth in the last quarter and a full-year growth of 2.5 percent, exceeding forecasts. However, not all data brought good news, with flat US durable goods orders in December and a higher-than-estimated 214,000 initial jobless claims last week disappointing investors.In its January meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) opted to keep deposit facility rates at an all-time high of 4 percent, signalling a commitment to maintaining these rates to address concerns about a looming recession and easing inflationary pressures. Despite the challenges, the ECB remains determined to bring inflation back to its 2 percent target.Also read: Vodafone Idea likely to report marginal revenue growth in Q3; subscriber loss to continue: AnalystsGold prices on the COMEX fell to a one-week low of $2004 per troy ounce as hopes for an early Fed pivot to monetary easing diminished. Strong retail sales figures and higher-than-expected Q4 GDP numbers highlighted US consumer resilience to high-interest rates. COMEX Silver experienced a similar trajectory, initially slipping to near $22 per troy ounce but recovering as industrial metals rallied, pushing it above $23 per troy ounce.Global trade disruptions in the Red Sea and a significant draw in US oil stocks propelled WTI Crude oil prices to a two-month high of $77.5 per barrel. US inventories fell over 9 million barrels last week, six times more than forecasted, reaching their lowest level since October. The ongoing threat from Yemen's Houthi group to target ships linked to Israel until aid reaches Gaza adds to concerns about elevated oil prices.Also read: Yes Bank Q3 Results: Net profit soars 349.7% to Rs 231.6 crore; asset quality stableLME base metals rallied on the back of optimism surrounding additional stimulus from China. Reports of a Chinese stock market rescue package and comments from People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng about cutting the reserve requirement ratio for banks in early February fueled the rally. The rare move of pre-emptively announcing a reserve requirement ratio cut in response to economic concerns underscored mounting disappointment with the government's actions.Copper and Zinc surged to their highest levels since early January, while Aluminium crossed the $2,250 per tonne mark. Positive developments in Flash Manufacturing PMI in the EU and UK, coupled with expanding factory activity in the US in January, provided additional support.As the markets shift focus to the upcoming US Core PCE data, estimated to have risen at an annual pace of 3 percent in December, down from November's 3.2 percent, investors anticipate potential relief if Core PCE continues to cool. This comes ahead of the FOMC meeting next week, where both the FOMC and BoE are expected to maintain rates.Market participants will carefully scrutinize policy guidance, with particular attention on any softening of language by the Fed regarding progress in easing inflation, which could impact the dollar given the ECB's recent stance on rate cuts.Amid heightened volatility driven by central bank meetings and the US labour report, the upcoming 0.5 percentage point cut in China's Reserve Requirement Ratio (RRR) on February 5 and indications of additional stimulus offer a glimmer of optimism in an otherwise uncertain landscape.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, STT accounts for just about 1.5 percent of the direct tax collection estimate of Rs 18.24 lakh crore.","With indices at new highs, retail participation in derivatives increasing at breakneck speed and F&O volumes dwarfing cash volume by 400x, the grapevine has it that another hike in securities transaction tax (STT) could be on cards this interim Budget.Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been reminding participants that 9 out of 10 traders lose money in F&O, thus a hike in STT could increase hurdle rate and keep volumes in check.Furthermore, as the government looks to boost tax collections to manage its fiscal position, its gaze may turn towards the stock market to mop up resources.STT was introduced in 2004. It is levied on transactions involving various types of securities. All stock market transactions that involve equity or equity derivatives, such as futures and options (F&O), are liable under STT, as are mutual fund transactions.The government expects to collect Rs 27,625 crore from STT in FY24, which is 10.5 percent higher than the revised budget estimate of the preceding financial year. It will account for about 1.5 percent of the direct tax collection estimate of Rs 18.24 lakh crore.Follow Budget 2024 expectations LIVE updates, here.It might look like a small drop in a big ocean, but at an individual level, investors and traders pay several other taxes, including Goods and Services Tax (GST), stamp charges, exchange transaction fees, and so on. Rajesh Baheti, Managing Director at Crosseas Capital Services, believes any further hike in STT might not sit well with proprietary traders that make up 40-45 percent of F&O volumes.Currently, the STT rate for equity delivery is 0.1 percent on both the buy and sell sides. For equity intraday, it is 0.025 percent on the sell side. For equity futures, it is 0.0125 percent on the sell side. For equity options, it is 0.0625 percent on the sell side and 0.125 percent on exercise.What happened last year?As per amendments to the Finance Bill 2023, the STT on the sale of options was hiked to Rs 6,250 on a turnover of Rs 1 crore against Rs 5,000, while on the sale of futures contracts, the STT was increased to Rs 1,250 on a turnover of Rs 1 crore compared to the earlier rate of Rs 1,000.However, volumes were not greatly impacted. Take a gander: NSE’s average monthly cash turnover for December 2023 was Rs 1.03 lakh crore, and for F&O, it was a whopping Rs 379 lakh crore. This is despite the hike in STT last year.Also Read: Budget 2024: Could consumption stocks come back in favour post the interim budget?Baheti says, “It might not have impacted last time, but there is always a tipping point. Two consecutive years of STT hikes can be detrimental to volumes. Last time, soon after the STT hike was announced, NSE rolled back the increase in its exchange transaction charges to offset some of the impact. NSE’s transaction charges have been at the same level for years now, and it won’t be willing to reduce any further from these levels.”Will they, won’t they?As STT on F&O was hiked last year, Rajesh Palviya, Head - Technical Research at Axis Securities, believes the probability of any further rate hike in the current budget seems feeble.Independent analyst Manish Shah also concurs. “I believe that the probability of an STT hike is low, as it was already hiked in March 2023,” he said. “The government expected to collect about Rs 27,000 crore for FY24, and most probably this expectation will be exceeded, given the huge trading volumes,” he added.Also Read: Budget 2024: Defence stock valuations are stretched but may rally if budget allocation is stepped upShah added that any hike can hurt market sentiment as the increase in the cost of transactions will hit the profitability of traders.“The economy is doing fine, and the revenue collection by the government is very good. Any more burden on the trader community is not fair to the trading and investment community,” Shah said.Impact on HFTs and option sellersAccording to Trivesh D, Chief Operating Officer of Tradejini, a broking firm, when STT is hiked, the move does not affect option buyers as much as it affects high-frequency traders and those selling options regularly. These groups are more sensitive to changes in market conditions and are likely to be impacted the most, he said.As per Baheti’s calculations, 40-45 percent of F&O volumes are proprietary trades, 35 percent retail, and the rest are institutional clients.“The real effect of the STT hike will be visible in case the bear market starts. Then, the pinch might be felt even more,” Trivesh D said.“I firmly believe that for India to establish itself as a price influencer for its produced and consumed commodities, it is imperative to maintain low transaction costs,” he concluded.The market is in wait-and-watch mode now. The mystery unravels on February 1, or, like last year, it may come out of the blue in an amendment to the Financial Bill at a later date. "

524,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-weekender-the-budget-must-set-the-stage-for-strong-long-term-growth-12130431.html,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | The Budget must set the stage for strong long-term growth ,"January 27, 2024 10:20 AM IST",The government must resist the temptation to be populist in the forthcoming Budget and instead ensure capex-led growth funded by privatisation,"Dear Reader,The big question in the forthcoming interim Budget is: Will it be a pre-election one, replete with sops? At first glance, there appears to be little need for handouts, what with real GDP growth widely expected to be around 7 percent for the next few years. Corporate and bank balance sheets are in fine shape and investment demand is powering the economy. Bank credit is growing robustly. The stock markets are scaling new highs. It’s true that the pre-election interim Budget of 2019 was a populist one, as we pointed out here. But then, real GDP growth in 2023-24 is estimated at 7.3 percent while it was 6.5 percent in 2018-19. Surely, the economy can now do without new sops?But look under the hood and a rather different picture emerges. First and foremost, as the IMF’s Fiscal Monitor points out, the overall deficit of the Centre and the states is estimated to be 8.8 percent of GDP in 2023-24, compared to 6.4 percent in 2018-19. And the gross debt of the Centre and the states is estimated at 81.9 percent of GDP in 2023-24, against 70.4 percent of GDP in 2018-19. What’s more, the central government has promised to prune its fiscal deficit down to 4.5 percent of GDP by 2025-26, from the current fiscal year’s estimate of 5.9 percent. Hence, the need for substantial fiscal consolidation. That’s why IndusInd Bank chief economist Gaurav Kapur wrote here: “The Budget should thus focus on strengthening the long-term growth impulses provided by public investments, building fiscal buffers to counter future shocks, and putting public debt on a downward path to free up space for productive spending.”But there’s a catch. Consumption growth, the GDP estimates show, will be the lowest in many years in the current fiscal year. Growth in the farm sector is estimated to be a mere 1.8 percent year-on-year. Average real rural wages for men in November, the latest month for which data are available from the Labour Bureau, show y-o-y growth of a piffling 0.2 percent. Rural food inflation, which was 0.2 percent in 2018-19, was at 8.97 percent in December 2023.  Moreover, our columnist Latha Venkatesh wrote that Niti Aayog’s claim of a steep fall in poverty in the last nine years doesn’t pass the smell test. The flip side of the rising premiumisation in consumer markets is the poor performance of the mass market. The government’s Periodic Labour Force data show a rising proportion of unpaid helpers among those considered to be employed. And let’s not forget that 80 crore Indians are still getting 5 kgs of foodgrain free every month—If they were really doing well, why do they need the subsidy?For all these reasons, there’s a possibility that the Budget may go in for more handouts this year too, or at least increase spending in rural areas.But it’s not a foregone conclusion. One difference between the last interim Budget and now is that in 2018-19, the construction sector was growing at 6.5 percent, while it’s estimated to grow 10.7 percent in 2023-24, thanks to the government’s capex push. That should provide more employment for the masses. In other words, instead of increasing consumption subsidies, the government must continue its capex push, perhaps increasing the incentives for its affordable housing and other programmes aimed at augmenting capital expenditure by the corporate sector. That, combined with fiscal consolidation and low government borrowing, would reinforce the incipient capex recovery and lead to a new growth cycle. A great opportunity is the capex needed for the transition to a green economy. After all, the growth spurts of the East Asian economies were on account of strong and sustained high capital investment to GDP ratios—in China, for example, is excess of 40 percent.  Funding, of course, can easily be arranged if the government goes in for disinvestment, privatisation and asset monetisation. Putting in place such a framework for long-term growth would be the ideal Budget for the markets. Do keep a close watch on our recommendations after the Budget this year, especially after the stellar performance of our MC Pro Budget 2023 Portfolio. Cheers, Manas Chakravarty Here are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets: Stocks Zee Entertainment, Paytm, Persistent Systems, Metro Brands, Colgate, Axis Bank, Polycab, Cyient DLM, Sona BLW, TVS,  Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra, JSW Energy, Pidilite Industries, Havells India, Laurus LabsBudget 2024 Cement supply uptick may keep prices in check Defence capex sees renewed thrust Scope to unlock tourism potential What past performance tells us of market behaviour on Interim Budget day Govt support key to India’s electrification story Companies and industry IDFC First Bank’s 5-year plan, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Tech Mahindra, Zee Entertainment, Tata Steel,  Sony needs to introspect on why it signed up to a merger of unequals Indian oil and gas firms must pay more attention to geopolitical risks Fintechs must realise that the time for reckoning is nigh Markets Markets near peaks: should investors book profits or hold? Did the SEBI FPI ownership norm cause the market to fall? Badla financiers are alive and flourishing Why 2024 can be the year of bond revival Financial Times Grumbles about passive investing may have a point Martin Wolf: The dangers lurking in our messy and unpredictable world Biden’s green spending splurge is a hard model to copy Inside Edge Oracle punters piggyback on Tortoise fund, HDFC Bank loyalist perseveres, operators go loco on IRCTC AK-47 has Rain in his crosshairs, contra view on Sanghi Industries, Zee drama—the next act Economy and policy Electronics—let the export edge give impetus to local manufacturing A robust bus transport system is essential for cities to thrive Pro Economic Tracker Personal Finance After 80% returns in one year, does CPSE ETF still make sense? Children settled abroad?

It closed down ~90 points. On the daily charts, we can observe that the counter-trend rally faced resistance at the zone of 21,520–21,550. On the downside, the 21,240–21,220 zone acted as a support zone where the 40-day moving average is placed. Thus, the Nifty is consolidating within these two parameters. A breach of this range shall lead to a move in that direction. The hourly momentum indicator has a positive crossover which is a buy signal and hence there can be a minor degree bounce up to 21,520–21,550 before it resumes the next leg of the fall.Bank Nifty has witnessed a sharp pullback from intraday lows though closed marginally in the red. On the hourly charts, we can observe that there is a positive divergence and a positive crossover which indicates a loss of momentum on the downside and indicates that there can be a relief rally going ahead till 45,500- 45,700. On the downside, 44,600–44,500 is the crucial support zone.Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities The market is witnessing a lot of volatility ahead of the interim Budget with a negative bias as investors further booked profits to cut down their long positions on the expiry day.

Or do you see the index breaking October lows in the coming days?For the last two trading sessions, Bank Nifty has been finding support on its 200 DEMA (day exponential moving average), which is currently placed at 44,568. Bank Nifty has already witnessed a healthy correction of more than 4,200 points from the all-time high of 48,636 registered in December 2023. 200 DEMA always has high significance as support when benchmark indices reach near it after a healthy correction.Below 200 DEMA, we see strong support coming in the range of 43,800-44,000, derived from the upward sloping trend line, which adjoins the weekly low of March 17, 2023 and October 27, 2023. The recent fall in Bank Nifty is more sector-specific and there is no across-the-board weakness in other sectors.Also read: Momentum mania: 12 new midcap stocks entered the Nifty 200 Momentum 30 IndexThe breadth of the market is very strong and that’s why we feel that the fall in Bank Nifty from here would be limited as most of the negatives have been discounted in the price recently. The maximum downside could be up to 43,800 odd levels in case the index breaks 200 DEMA support.October 2023 bottom is placed at 42,105 and we see less probability of that happening in the coming days.Are the charts telling you that the Nifty 50 will break the 20,500 mark in the coming weeks, before resuming another leg of up move?No. If correction were to continue, we see Nifty finding support in the zone of 20,800-20,900, derived from upward sloping trendline adjoining the weekly highs of July 21, 2023 and September 15, 2023. There is a huge unfilled gap in the range of 20,507-20,291.In the bear case scenario, Nifty is expected to find support in this gap zone. Any level above 21,600 would negate the recent downtrend. The best part of in Indian market is the strong breadth, which gives us the confidence that the downside would be limited in benchmark indices from the current levels.Also read: Budget and Markets: Will the PSU rally continue post-budget?Has the Zee Entertainment Enterprises bottomed out after severe correction?No. Zee Entertainment has nosedived more than 40 percent month to date. The stock has breached the previous swing low of Rs 170 on the long-term charts. It has also confirmed the bearish Head and Shoulder pattern on the monthly chart. So positionally stock looks weak.However, we can not rule out the possibility of a pullback rally after such a steep fall in a short period. We see strong resistance between Rs 175 and Rs 180 in the stock.Which are your top two budget picks, and why?GSFC (Gujarat State Fertilizers & Chemicals) and MOILFertiliser, mining and PSU sectors have been outperforming and the same is expected to continue from here. Both stocks have bullish setups on the short to medium-term charts. Considering the trend and the kind of resilience shown by these stocks, we believe that both GSFC and MOIL would generate healthy alpha from here for positional traders before and after the budget.RITES was the biggest gainer in the Nifty 500 index. Do you see the stock extending its upward move in the coming weeks too?In technical analysis, we say the trend is your friend. If a stock is resilient and is into bullish momentum, traders should always be with it. No matter what the reason is, railway stocks have been showing a great amount of strength on the charts.The stock can remain overbought for a longer period unless the price breaks the support. At present stock is at its all-time high and the trend is expected to remain bullish in the coming days. The pattern target for the stock comes in at Rs 730 odd levels, where traders can think of booking profits or raising stop-loss.KPIT Technologies seems to have decisively broken the consolidation on the downside. Do you see the stock falling towards 200-day EMA once?The stock has broken down below the last 10 week’s price consolidation with a jump in volumes. In history, we saw this stock finding support near its 100 DEMA multiple times, which is currently placed at Rs 1,350 odd levels. The sustainable level below Rs 1,350 could drag the stock towards its 200 DEMA, placed at Rs 1,212 odd levels.Do you think Nifty IT will consolidate in the coming weeks by taking support at around 35,500-36,000 area?IT Index is all set to register a new all-time high above 39,447. At present, the Nifty IT index is down 7.5 percent from its all-time high. This is the only recognized sectoral Index which has failed to register a new all-time high in the bullish rally that started in April 2023.Recently we observed bullish momentum coming back to the IT index. So yes, there is good support in the zone of 35,500-36,000 in the Nifty IT index and the same should be utilized to create fresh long positions in IT stocks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

So far, the market lost 3.5 percent from a record high.He feels microcaps and smallcaps are already showing signs of weakness.Among sectors, he is bullish on the power sector. ""The road map to increase power through RE (renewable energy) both solar and wind and green hydrogen should emerge as a mega trend for the next few years,"" says Umeshkumar with over 24 years of experience in the capital market.Do you see any risk factor after reading the corporate earnings announced so far?The risk of extrapolation by the investors that the same run rate of huge earnings growth will continue is the emerging risk as almost all sectors have done fairly well in the current quarter or half-yearly numbers. However, the risk is also emerging on the unsecured or personal loans side which has seen massive growth, and the RBI is well looking into it through appropriate policy measures. But the staggering Rs 48 lakh crore in the portfolio of unsecured loans which was just half four years ago is the reason to worry.Corporate balance sheets have become stronger, but the finances of the masses could be weaker than ever before given the amount of debt they loaded up.

In IT, we saw divergent views in LTIMindtree and Infosys.Companies from QSR (quick service restaurant) are still hopeful that inflation will subside and purchasing power for discretionary spending will increase this year, on the other hand, realty is gung-ho and is building in a more robust outlook. All in all, most are expecting a repeat of decent performance going forward.Do you still see great value in the banking sector (PSU as well as private)? Have you spotted any concerns for PSU or private banks?The banking sector was facing raw material problems in the year gone by when stock markets were booming and realty sales were at an all-time high. Raw material for banks is the cost deposits which was scares. This had led to costs increasing for most private lenders and NFBCs, however PSUs were partially spared.Also read: Here are 68 stocks that turned multi-baggers from the last Republic DayBut when the tide tuns, banks will be in a better place both from a valuation perspective and growth which will come on the back of low base. PSUs are red hot now and can remain so, but from a long-term sustained wealth creation point of view private lenders now offer a better risk reward.Do you think the market will complete 10 percent odd correction in the short term, before getting into the next leg of the up-move towards a new high?Looks likely but only after the budget as everything will be entering a lull period for a few months after the budget. Microcaps and small-caps are already showing signs of weakness, not all stocks are participating in the rally, very few are still roaring but every day that number too is falling which can be said that markets are preparing for a correction.Is the possible delay in interest rate cuts a major concern for the market or do you see any other risk factor (including banking) that's dampening the market sentiment?Interest rate cuts, whether they happen now or in six months, are not a worry. The worry is frothy valuations in some of the capex driven sectors, autos, realty, power etc wherein too much of future growth is built into and when numbers don’t show up, the markets will inevitably disappoint.Also read: Budget and Markets: Will the PSU rally continue post-budget?Do you expect the government to announce more measures to boost rural demand, and infrastructure? Is it an important event (interim budget) to watch out for?There is enough on the platter for the government to build infrastructure both in rural and urban areas, but this time something in the form of freebies for the rural or lower strata which can give a negative surprise to the market. This is an election year everything is possible.Are you bullish on the power sector as a whole?Yes, the power sector fundamentally lacked fresh investments in the last few years, stranded power projects etc on one hand and increasing consumption on account of digitization, smart phones, and EVs (electric vehicles). This led to shortages. The road map to increase power through RE (renewable energy) both solar and wind and green hydrogen should emerge as a mega trend for the next few years.Do you want to wait for Q4 earnings before taking more exposure to the IT sector or is it the right time to enter?IT as the sector is becoming a staple sector, we will have to have in our portfolio for sustainable compounding. In that longer-term mindset, it is better to buy when commentaries are negative and when others are reducing the exposure. This has happened in the last few quarters and therefore now it is ripe for a decent rise given the subdued interest rate scenarios across the world.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The week gone by brought us down to one of the lowest levels for the month so far. Many of us might have missed out on opportunities to trade at these levels when they were trading last time around.This triggers bargain-hunting activity. The opportunities are generally plenty, so what to trade is not a very difficult decision but how to trade is difficult. This is because of the fall in the market that has recently taken place along with the nervousness.Let us discuss a couple of ways to deal with this difficulty by bargain hunting with the help of Options. There are 2 different approaches to this based on how much time we are willing to hold on to the position.Approach #1 Positional Big Bets to Be in the Trade for days if not weeks.Many times we may end up creating the trade for bargain hunting while not having a clear idea of the time it could take for the trade to close. So now, we have to take care of 2 difficulties.1. Safeguard of capital if things go wrong for overnight trade it will go wrong big.2. Safeguard against time value-related loss if we are bargain hunting with Options.Strategy: ATM Bull Call SpreadATM: The strike we select will be close to the current market price. Since we want maximum action best place to be trading in options is an ATM strike.Bull Call: Bull Call gives the Option type and the transaction type. A bullish position in the Call option can be created by Buying a Call Option.Spread: Spread means having simultaneous Buy and Sell positions in 2 Options of the same stock or index, same type and same expiry but of different strikes. In our case, we will be buying a Lower Strike Call and selling a Higher Strike Call.Example: Stock at INR 100 with a Target of 105Buy 100 Call& Sell 105 Call (higher strike).This trade will have a Maximum gain of INR 5 (105-100) - Net Premium Paid. The maximum loss will be Net Premium Paid.I still recommend exiting this strategy if your stop loss or target in the stock gets hit. One could get a better reward at a much lower risk in this strategy compared to trading in the stock or stock future.Approach #2 if it is a trade to catch a dead cat bounce.Most of us are familiar with this. It is one of those situations when the stock has fallen heavily and we are looking for a rebound just tomorrow. The only difficulty here is that what if tomorrow again we fall by another 10 percent.Strategy: Higher Strike Call BuyHigher Strike Call: The strike we select will be higher than the current market price. The strike should be 2 steps higher than the current market price.Again, exit this strategy upon rebound on the next day. If rebound does not come, even then exit triggers time stop loss.Both these strategies are best as per me because if the fall continues, we will still not be punished.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

That resulted in AmEx bringing in $4.91 billion in interest revenue last quarter, up from $3.62 billion a year earlier.","American Express’ fourth quarter profits jumped 23% from last year as more cardmembers kept a running balance on their accounts compared with previous years, meaning more interest income for the credit card issuer.But a considerable rise in maintained balances ""up 17% from last year"" as well as rise in delinquencies and credit losses, can raise questions about the financial health of AmEx cardmembers who are typically more financially stable and more likely to pay off balances by the end of each month.The New York company posted a profit of $1.93 billion, or $2.62 a share. That’s up from a profit $1.57 billion, or $2.07 a share, in the same period a year earlier. That fell short of analyst projections for per-share earnings of $2.64, according to FactSet.However, AmEx gave a strong full-year forecast for 2024 and boosted its quarterly dividend, which helped lift the stock in midday trading Friday.There was a relatively modest increase in spending by cardmembers in the quarter, up 5% to $434.4 billion. The credit card company historically makes the bulk of its revenue from the fees it collects from merchants who accept American Express cards as a form of payment. Spending on card accounts slowed as well, with the average cardmember spending about 2% more on their card from a year ago.Profits this quarter were driven in part by interest-accruing accounts cardmembers who aren’t paying off their balances in full. AmEx pivoted away from the charge card business model before the COVID-19 pandemic to a model that encouraged customers to keep a balance. That push has been largely successful, which means AmEx collects interest from accounts where historically it had not.AmEx had $126 billion in cardmember loans at the end of 2023, up 17% from last year. That resulted in AmEx bringing in $4.91 billion in interest revenue last quarter, up from $3.62 billion a year earlier.However, the push to allow cardmembers to keep a balance has led to an increasing number of credit card accounts going delinquent. The company wrote off 2.2% of credit card balances last quarter, up markedly from 1.3% a year earlier. The number of accounts that are 30 days past due also ticked up.AmEx expects revenues this year will climb between 9% and 11%, and it believes earnings per share will be between $12.65 and $13.15 per share."

Analysts anticipate continued attention on this sector in the FY25 budget.Although the upcoming budget is an interim one, it is expected to lay the groundwork for future policy decisions. Most brokerages anticipate a focus on fiscal consolidation and priorities regarding capital and non-capital expenditure.Also read: Thermal power plants' capacity utilisation to rise to 69% in FY'25: ICRA""We anticipate the policy direction and priorities to align closely with recent budgets, as the government navigates between fostering growth recovery and managing challenging debt dynamics,"" Elara Capital said in a recent report.Additional momentumAccording to a pre-budget report from Axis Securities, the power sector is expected to gain additional momentum in the interim budget. It cites the government's heightened focus on expanding the utilisation of renewable energy as a top priority.The report specifically highlights the inclusion of further details about the recently launched Pradhanmantri Suryodaya Yojana, a scheme to make electricity affordable and make India self-reliant in power.Anticipated announcements in the interim budget include higher capital expenditure for renewable energy, incentives for green initiatives, and production-linked incentives (PLIs) for solar module manufacturing.Additionally, the report suggests expectations for dynamic feed-in tariffs, grid modernisation to better integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, and capital spending on battery storage infrastructure. Other anticipated measures include a potential reduction in customs duty on solar cells to 5 percent from 25 percent and an extension of the waiver on inter-state transmission system charges for renewable projects commissioned beyond June 2025.Also read: Union Budget 2024: Gender budgeting in energy schemes is a sure path to equitable, women-led developmentSagar Lele, co-founder of Rupeeting, is betting on the power growth story and expects more push on renewable energy, with a focus on incentives for module manufacturing and building an ecosystem for renewable energy.“The overall direction will be to ensure that there is capacity so that demand is fulfilled, whether that is thermal or renewable. And on the 2030 goals, whether it is solar, wind, or green hydrogen, the goal will be to get some policy initiatives in place to build the ecosystem to facilitate our targets,” he said.Nuvama Institutional Equities estimates that the government may also focus on indigenous energy storage technology development and renewable power supply, which should address energy security and material sustainability.“There should be sufficient allocation in decentralised renewable energy and energy access to make it mainstream to the country's green growth,” it said.Power sector viewLele is positive about the power sector given the investment amounts, government reforms, and measures being taken to overcome the power deficit, such as extending Section 11 of the Electricity Act, under which the government can ask power-generating companies to override guidelines under extraordinary circumstances to maintain output.The government has added 194,394 MW of generation capacity in the past nine years, the ministry of power said on January 2. The present installed capacity of power generation is about 426,132 MW. Of the generation capacity of 9,943 MW added in the FY24, about 1,674 MW was based on fossil fuel sources and 8,269 MW on renewable energy, the ministry said.IIFL Securities analysts said recent comments by the power ministry suggest the government is looking at stepping up coal-based capacity addition to meet rising demand.“This is in addition to the more than 350GW RE capacity addition that the government has envisaged by 2032. And to that extent, the entire sector offers a significant runway for growth over the next 8-10 years,” the analysts said.In the renewable space, according to a November 2023 Kotak Institutional Equities report, the government is targeting 500 GW of renewable capacity by FY30 and has improved renewable auctioning from ~15 GW annual run-rate to 20 GW for YTD FY24, with plans to achieve 50 GW of annual auctions for the remainder of FY24. It added that while key players have lined up plans to set up renewable energy capacities, execution has been patchy so far.Analysts estimate power capex to continue to grow over the next 2-3 years. In a September 2023 Jefferies report, analysts said power capex should grow 9x at a CAGR of 20 percent during FY23-26, up from 2.2 percent during FY10-20.As India enters a phase of capex-driven GDP growth, Jefferies said power intensity should rise.“We expect annual thermal PLFs to cross 80 percent by FY2025E, above a two-decade peak. Power generation and T&D investments should rise 2.2x to $280 billion in FY24E-30E vs. FY2017-2023,” it said.Power stocks to track before and after Budget 2024With the interim budget expectations, stocks with renewable energy capability are expected to make some gains during and after the budget.Analysts at JM Financial said in a recent report that they are positive on growth opportunities for the NHPC stock as it is one of the largest hydropower-generating utilities in the country with an aggregate installed capacity of 7,071 MW. This is 15 percent of India’s installed hydropower capacity.“With 10,515 MW of projects under construction (hydro and renewables), the company’s installed capacity with regulated return is set to grow by 3,420 MW by FY2026, up by 50 percent after a gap of 3 years, resulting in revenue growth of 20 percent and a net profit CAGR of 11 percent over FY23–26E,"" the analysts said in the report. NHPC is also the “only large utility with a 100 percent green energy portfolio,” they said.While NHPC’s Q2 results missed estimates on account of lower generation due to lower water levels in reservoirs and flash floods in Himachal Pradesh, Elara analysts remain positive on the stock due to visibility from ongoing projects.NHPC has 15 projects (hydro and solar) of 10,449 MW under construction, including two units of the 8x250 MW Subansiri project that are expected to be commissioned in Q4, two units of 4x200 MW Parbati-II in early FY25, and the remaining units progressively by Q2 of FY25.In the private sector, Tata Power is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with a clean energy portfolio of 5,500 MW, which includes solar, wind, and hydropower.“The company plans to achieve 70 percent clean power generation by FY30 and plans to meet this target by installing between 1.5 and 2 GW of renewable energy annually. By FY2027, the company plans to incur a capex of Rs 60,000 crore, with around 45 percent of the capex being spent on renewable projects,” Sharekhan by BNP Paribas said in a report.Recently, the management of Power Grid Corporation of India increased its FY24 capex target to Rs 10,000 crore from Rs 8,800 crore. Analysts estimate the capex will move up due to the spending of Rs 12,500 crore and capitalisation of Rs 17,000 crore for FY25.“Longer term, the company has a Rs 1.9 lakh crore capex plan for the next decade that includes around Rs 1.7 lakh crore for transmission infrastructure, Rs 0.1 crore for solar generation, Rs 0.15 crore for smart metering infrastructure, and Rs 0.10 crore for the data centre business,” BoB Capital said in a report.BoB Capital values the company at 2.1x. According to the report, Power Grid warrants a higher valuation due to “its superior ROE of 15-19 percent, high 5.6 percent dividend yield in FY2023, and lowest risk profile in the power sector.""NTPC currently accounted for 17 percent of India’s installed capacity and 25 percent of the total power generation in FY23. According to analysts at Axis Securities, NTPC's substantial portfolio in conventional power, with a firm cost-plus business model, positions it well in a growing peak power cycle.“This structure contributes to stable cash flows and will facilitate growth led by renewable energy,” Axis said.NTPC has around 10 GW of thermal capacity under construction, which is expected to be commissioned by FY26. NTPC has a target of 60 GW of renewable capacity by FY32, up from the current 3.3 GW.Analysts estimate that until the elections, there may not be a slowdown in sentiment or stock price. Over the past year, stocks in the segment have seen healthy gains, with NTPC and NHPC shares gaining over 90 percent, recently listed IREDA with almost 2x returns, and SJVN with about 3x returns.IIFL Securities analyst said power capex, particularly generation, has a multiplier effect and will likely trigger a decadal long investment cycle, making the segment and associated companies a compelling play.“We note that the power sector’s weight in the overall market is near multi-year lows, and has tremendous scope to improve with the expected investments planned to meet the rising demand,” the analysts said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

534,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/budget-and-markets-will-the-public-sector-undertaking-stock-rally-continue-post-budget-12130921.html,Budget and Markets: Will the PSU stock rally continue post-budget?,"January 27, 2024 09:48 AM IST","Analysts believe that the rally in PSU stocks is likely to extend beyond budget announcements as well, but advised investors to exercise caution as valuations turn rich","Shares of public sector undertakings (PSUs) have seen a stupendous rally in the five years that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance government has been in power, with persistent capex in growth verticals such as railways, infrastructure, power and defence. This rally across the PSU pack will in the immediate future be determined by the upcoming interim budget, given the government’s capex allocation for each pocket, said analysts.However, they warned investors to exercise caution while putting their money in these state-controlled entities as valuations in some stocks look overheated compared with their private peers. In the past one year, one out of every three PSU stock has more than doubled, helping the BSE PSU Index surge over 65 percent.Shrikant Chouhan, head, equity research at Kotak Securities, expects this rally to extend but become more stock-specific once the budget capex outlay is announced. He said that investors’ confidence in the PSU pack increased after the state election results reinforced the expectation of stable government formation.ALSO READ: Budget 2024: Nirmala Sitharaman second finance minister to present budget 6 times in a rowPrivatisation switch: Investors’ newfound faith in PSUsThe BJP-led NDA government made an effort to push divestment of PSUs when it came into power in 2014, but only two—Air India and Neelanchal Ispat Nigam—have been sold to private owners so far. In other strategic disinvestments, the government would simply sell its entire stake in one PSU to another. The ones in pipeline - Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Container Corporation of India (Concor), IDBI Bank and BEML—also look like a distant dream now.While the disposition of selected PSUs has lagged, investors’ newfound faith in these companies comes amid the government’s efforts to run them more professionally, said analysts.AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital, said that several PSU companies like NHPC, NMDC, Mazagaon Dock, Rail Vikas Nigam, NTPC and Ircon International are now running more efficiently than they ever had. “Employee cost and efficiency have improved across all PSU companies,” he added.The reality of ‘privatisation’: Can delays, overvalued OFS suppress value of PSUs?Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities find the Street’s hopes about PSU privatisation quite misplaced. “The government’s stated policy on privatisation of PSUs, practical issues seen in previous attempts to privatise PSUs and high prices of PSUs should provide plentiful caution against making privatisation as an investment thesis for PSUs,"" the brokerage firm noted.ALSO READ: India Inc eagerly awaits FM's Feb 1 Budget for growth boosting measuresSeveral practical challenges have in the past stymied the government’s privatisation efforts. Concor is a noteworthy example, as the government had to rework several agreements between the port-hinterland link operator and its parent Indian Railways to enable privatisation. However, it is yet to take place despite it being cleared for privatisation in November 2019. BPCL, too, did not see much interest among potential bidders given the sunset nature of the oil refining and marketing sector. Market experts believe the delay could widen as finding the right buyer and price takes time.Moreover, the government wants disinvestment to be strategic. An indiscriminate offer-for-sale (OFS)—the preferred route for disinvestment—could depress the value of PSU stocks. The government believes that if investors are less prepared to subscribe to an OFS, it leads to further discounts, eventually suppressing the right value of the said PSU.Will the govt extend its divestment target this budget or keep it tempered?According to analysts at ratings agency ICRA, the government is likely to keep disinvestment proceeds below Rs 50,000 crore in this interim budget. ""Given the uncertainties involved in market transactions, it will be prudent to set a moderate target of sub-Rs 50,000 crore for FY25, instead of a higher aim. This is to avoid any disruption in budget math or large shortfall,"" they said.In the current fiscal, the government mopped up around Rs 10,000 crore from PSU disinvestments, substantially below the targeted Rs 51,000 crore.What should PSUs expect from this interim budget’s capex layout?The interim budget could see some moderation in capex due to the government's focus on fiscal consolidation, but roads and railways will continue to command a higher share of the total allocation, predicted analysts at Nirmal Bang. ""Railways may see the highest increase in allocation, with spending up by nearly 40 percent year-on-year in FY24 year-to-date,"" the brokerage firm underlined.The government has been prioritising capex post-pandemic in order to bolster the economy. Since 2020-21, the capex allocation has seen a consistent rise, first by 35 percent on-year to Rs 5.5 lakh crore, then a further 35 percent hike to Rs 7.5 lakh crore in 2022-23, and finally a marked over-37 percent increase to touch a record high of Rs 10 lakh crore in 2023-24.ALSO READ: Budget 2024 Highlights: Govt must continue to lay major thrust on public capex, says FICCIWith capex surpassing budget projections for three years, market experts remain bullish on PSU stocks but advise investors to keep an eye on the political front.""Though the outlook for PSUs remains positive for 2024, we advise investors to selectively invest as their performance hinges largely on political developments and policy continuity,"" said Trivesh D, COO at Bengaluru-based trading platform Tradejini.How should investors approach PSU stocks? Stay wary of richer valuations, experts warnSeveral PSU stocks have been commanding premium valuations compared to their private sector peers. A PSU stock like Concor, for instance, is trading at 36.4 times one-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, much above Adani Ports and SEZ's 26.4 times PE multiple, pointed out analysts at Kotak Institutional equities.Metals and mining major Steel Authority of India, too, is trading at 13.4 times one-year forward PE ratio, higher than Tata Steel's 13.1 times. Besides, National Aluminium Company was at 14.2 times one-year forward PE ratio, higher than 11.7 percent of Hindalco, they added.How have PSU stocks fared in the last five years of the regime?In the past five years, shares of Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore and Gujarat State Financial Corporation emerged the biggest gainers on the BSE PSU Index, surging over 1,800 percent and 1,300 percent, respectively.Others like Orissa Mineral Development Company, Garden Reach, Bharat Electronics, BHEL, Ircon International and Tamilnadu Telecommunications delivered over 500 percent returns. On the flipside, RITES was the only loser in the BSE PSU Index, slipping 5 percent over the same period.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Most of the gains were seen between the middle of May and September 2023, and then again in December, while the rest of the period was consolidative for the market during the year.The performance of broader markets was brighter than the benchmarks with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices surging 54 percent and 64 percent, respectively.A total of 68 stocks of the Nifty 500 index stood out as star performers with multi-bagger returns from the closing of January 25, 2023, till January 25, 2024 (the period considered for the story), while the Nifty 500 index gained 28 percent during the same period.Further, the big gainers among sectors were realty, public sector undertaking (PSU), infrastructure, auto, pharma and energy stocks, registering a rally between 38 percent and 100 percent.Most of the stocks in the multi-bagger list are from the above-mentioned sectors. Moreover, half of these sectors like PSUs, infrastructure (including railway) and energy are expected to be star performers in the years to come as well, largely due to capex-driven growth, experts believe.The railway stocks were the best performer of the lot with Indian Railway Finance Corporation topping the list among the 68 stocks registering a 444 percent gain, Rail Vikas Nigam took the fourth spot with a 299 percent surge, while RITES was up 103 percent.Power and ancillaries space created the maximum multi-baggers during the year given the government's push to clean energy space, infrastructure and manufacturing sector, which ultimately boosted demand and as a result, there has been consistent addition in capacities by the company to meet the rising demand.Suzlon Energy, REC, Power Finance Corporation, SJVN, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Torrent Power, Sterling and Wilson Renewable Energy, Adani Power, JSW Energy and Olectra Greentech were the gainers in power space (directly as well as indirectly), rising 101-347 percent.Also read: Republic Day 2024: PM Modi, Macron discuss Red Sea crisis, Gaza conflict, and more""Contrary to global challenges, India's conducive environment for capex-driven growth stood out, evident in GST implementation, rising collections, and substantial government allocations to capex.

Hence, the opportunities will remain huge in the years to come, they believe.""We expect the government to further intensify capex on infrastructure to achieve its longer-term goals. There is no reason to put brakes on this important infrastructure transformation.

Housing & Urban Development Corporation, NBCC (India), Prestige Estates Projects, Sobha, DLF and Brigade Enterprises gained 115-245 percent.Among other stocks, BSE, Zomato, PB Fintech, Kalyan Jewellers India, PCBL, Jyothy Labs, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Global Health, Angel One, Vodafone Idea, Chalet Hotels, Multi Commodity Exchange of India, Bajaj Auto, Finolex Cables, Varun Beverages, Amber Enterprises India and Aster DM Healthcare rallied more than 100 percent either due to attractive valuations, news, improving financial metrics or were a major beneficiary of sector revival.Markets in the year aheadNow, coming back to markets, the rally in benchmark indices was driven largely by the hope of a start in interest rate cuts in 2024, overall strong earnings growth, and likely continuation of policies after general elections due to favourable state elections results in the recent past, consistent DIIs support, stable crude oil prices, and the results of economic reforms & measures announcing by the government. It was despite the geopolitical tensions.Also read: Nomura expects Fed to cut interest rates by 100 bps in 2024But, the year ahead may not generate similar kind of returns, experts said. They expect the year to generate around 10 percent market returns or a little less than that, and most likely to be volatile due to general elections in India & United States, and the focus on interest rate trajectory in the US.""The year 2023 was a good one for most of the stock markets globally barring a few, such as China. The double-digit percent return came not only in India but also in the US,"" Shailendra Kumar, Chief Investment Officer at Narnolia Financial Services said.Along with major geopolitical events and election outcomes during 2024, the US Fed policy stance will be key to how the market will move through 2024, he feels.According to Shailendra, current valuation and earnings growth going forward suggest a low single-digit return for the Indian market but if the FED policy change happens then 2024 will be another strong year. All in all Indian market remains a strong Buy if any correction happens, he believes.Nimesh Chandan, CIO at Bajaj Finserv Asset Management also agreed with Shailendra, saying it's crucial to monitor the interest rate trajectory in the US. Apart from that, overall, he expects 2024 to be an eventful year. ""The most important ones (event) are elections, both in India and the US,"" Chandan said.Speaking about the Lok Sabha Elections 2024, he said, ""Continuity of the incumbent government is something which equity markets have already started to price in after the recent state election outcomes. Any adverse election outcomes in June can derail the market sentiment. Currently, we see this as a low-probability event.""As far as the interest rates trajectory, Nimesh is of the view that the market currently anticipates a ""Goldilocks"" scenario, with interest rates easing without a recession.

The FPIs held relatively higher long positions compared to short positions in Index futures. Despite the price making fresh highs, the FPIs activity in Index futures remained subdued until January 16, 2024. When FPIs started to liquidate long positions, the tremors were felt in the markets.The Long-Short ratio went below the 50 percent mark and stood at 22.00 percent on the last day of January series as the FPIs aggressively built short positions and liquidated existing long positions since January 17. They now hold more short positions relative to long positions in Index futures.The Put-Call ratio (PCR), a sentiment indicator, started with 1.54 on the first day of January series and fell until 0.66 on the last day of January series. The reading of 1.54 suggested that the market is overbought and a healthy correction can’t be ruled out. The PCR fell below 1 on January 17 for the first time since November 22, 2023 as the Call writers (bears) outplayed the Put writers throughout the January series.On the Options front in the February monthly expiry, the 21,000 strike Put option has highest open interest with 29,08,000 contracts followed by the 20,000 strike Put option with 21,33,800 contracts. The strike prices with maximum Put open interest are the support levels. While on the Call side, the 23,000 Call has highest open interest with 30,99,600 contracts followed by the 22,000 Call strike with 18,28,150 contracts. The strike prices with maximum Call open interest are the resistance levels.Having said that, the current market scenario reveals a low Put-Call ratio (PCR) at 0.66 and a foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) Long-Short Ratio of 22 percent, suggesting a pronounced bearish sentiment in the January series. Historical trends indicate that whenever the PCR hovers around 0.5-0.6 and the long-short ratio is in the range of 10-15 percent, the market typically experiences a short-term rebound. Consequently, there is a considerable likelihood that the February series may witness a market recovery, dispelling the prevailing bearish sentiment and initiating an upward trend.Technically, the Nifty consolidated in a tight range of 21,500-21,800 levels for the first ten trading sessions of January series until January 11. The price broke out of the range on January 12 and made an all-time high of 22,124 on January 16. The price cracked 3.80 percent since then and closed at 21,353 on the last day of January series.A lower low, lower high price action structure is visible on the daily chart. The price action structure suggests we may be at the start of a short-term correction. The level of 21,285, which is also the immediate previous swing low (made on January 18) is crucial. A strong close below the 21,185 level can take the Index further down towards 20,800 levels.A bearish Engulfing candle was formed on the weekly chart in previous week with price closing lower again last week (ended January 25), confirms the bearish sentiment.The interim budget will be announced by the Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman on February 1 and hence, the market is expected to be extremely volatile in the upcoming week.If the index can hold on to the 21,285 levels, short covering (sellers booking profits) at 21,500 strike can push the Nifty higher. A strong close above 21,750 level can result in resumption of uptrend in Nifty.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Global developments may provide directional triggers.","Indian stock indices have been on the decline since mid-January 2024, after a strong bull run that started in November, and faced significant profit booking last week, primarily due to HDFC Bank's dismal performance.The banking sector, constituting 35 percent of the benchmark Nifty index, triggered a market nosedive. Looking forward, investors will monitor the interim budget set to be presented on February 1.Sameet Chavan, head research - technical and derivatives, at Angel One, analyses pre-budget positioning:Derivative activity indicates that the ongoing correction can be primarily attributed to long unwinding. Particularly noteworthy is the significant increase in bearish bets in the banking index, with open interest surging by more than 40 percent over the same timeframe. A substantial addition of short positions in the Bank Nifty for the upcoming series potentially reflects a strategic move ahead of the budget announcement.FIIs turn net sellersAfter continuous buying, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) turned net sellers in equities this month, selling Rs 26,700 crore of stocks in January. The major chunk seems to be in banking counters, mainly HDFC Bank, which had its worst monthly decline for the first time since March 2020.FIIs also trimmed long positions and added short positions in the index futures segment. Their long-short ratio plunged to 47 percent from 70 percent, indicating a complete shift from an overbought situation.Fear index surgesIndia VIX, a measure of market expectations of near-term volatility, has been on the rise and a surge beyond the 17 mark should be a cautionary signal for the market.Psychological support in jeopardyConsidering these critical data points, the psychological support level of 21,000 on the Nifty is in jeopardy.

Yet, given its interim nature without any major announcements expected, it is anticipated to unfold as uneventful. The preceding week witnessed substantial profit booking, and this trend has persisted into the current week. Notably, there has been a significant formation of short positions in the banking index on the derivatives front, coupled with foreign institutional investors engaging in selling activities in index futures, which hasn't been encouraging for bullish sentiments,"" Chavan said.Considering the recent developments, Chavan suggested refraining from adopting any aggressive directional strategies. Instead, a prudent approach would involve implementing a Bear Put Spread in the Nifty, which is a moderately bearish strategy with capped potential profit and loss.Bear Put Spread in Nifty: Recommended derivative strategyConsidering that the Nifty is currently hovering around the 21,300 zone, a strategic move would be to purchase a 21,200 put while simultaneously selling a 21,000 put. The risk-reward ratio for this Bear Put Spread strategy stands at approximately 1:2.3, making it an attractive option for traders.Tips for tradersChavan advises traders to remain nimble-footed going into the budget event. Since it's an interim budget, major reforms are not expected, and the markets may treat it as a non-event.Monitoring global developments is crucial as they are likely to provide directional triggers for our market in the coming weeks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

But for all its doubters, the US economy and markets continue to shock the world. For a moment at least, that’s worth celebrating.Gross domestic product expanded at a 3.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter, exceeding every forecast compiled by Bloomberg and helping validate record stock prices. And it’s largely happened on the back of strong consumption.Real personal consumption expenditures expanded at a 2.8% annualized pace in the quarter, with about 55% of that coming from services (including dining out, healthcare and recreation) and the balance from goods (clothing, durable goods, etc.)The numbers cap a year of positive economic surprises that defied predictions of imminent doom with policy rates at two-decade highs. They also show how the legacy of pandemic-era stimulus programs is still being written, with the infamous “stimulus checks” contributing to inflation on the one hand but also catalysing the start of a durable economic expansion. While the former initially got most of the attention, 2023 ended with inflation essentially back at the Federal Reserve’s 2% target and the consumer-driven economy still going strong.So what happened?For the past several years, the US economy has traded leadership between goods and services. During the heart of the pandemic, consumers deployed government checks on appliances and personal electronics and the services economy muddled through a deep recession. Having exhausted their need for appliances and TVs, consumers abandoned goods and went all-in on concerts, live sports and dining out from 2021 to early 2023. Finally, by the second half of 2023, our mini “goods recession” had ended but our newly rediscovered love of real-life experiences remained strong.Admittedly, American consumers will need money if this is going to continue, which means the labour market will have to stay strong and wage increases will have to keep coming in ahead of inflation. For that to happen without juicing future prices too much again, the US needs a sustainable run of strong labour productivity growth, the recipe that fuelled the remarkable growth and stock-market gains of the 1990s. That’s asking for a lot, but it’s hardly out of the question.In the popular imagination, productivity growth requires rapid adoption of futuristic technologies such as artificial intelligence, but there are still more mundane reservoirs of untapped productivity. Workers hired in the frenzied pandemic and post-pandemic labour markets are maturing into their roles, and employer-employee matching should steadily improve to marry the right opportunities with the ideal skill sets. Meanwhile, strong manufacturing investment fuelled by the Biden Administration’s economic initiatives should also help.As for companies, there’s hope that they may have taken lessons from the last four years that make them more efficient overall. Among other things, the pandemic experience taught everyone how to use work-from-anywhere technology. In the ensuing months and years, managers have had time to figure out whether office, remote or hybrid work best serves their companies and industries’ objectives and maximizes output. It’s been a rocky experimentation process for some, but those learnings should pay off in the medium-run. So too should the lessons of managing costs through an inflation scare.This may all read like a lot of wishful thinking, and I understand the sentiment. Among other things, interest rates are still high, and the massive US housing market is still in a strange state of paralysis. You also can’t write off the possibility of a resurgence in inflation amid Houthi militant attacks in the Red Sea, especially if the recent surge in freight costs is sustained.But at present, the US consumer story is trouncing the inflation story and making America look like a star on the world stage. For a moment, let’s all live in the present and celebrate that. Jonathan Levin  is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication"

This kind of active resistance by parliamentarians and civil society is essential, and should continue. Indonesia’s democracy is in its infancy","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As deepfakes go, it’s not a great one. Even so, the viral video of Indonesia’s former president and dictator Suharto that was created using artificial intelligence took the world’s most populous Muslim nation by storm. It racked up millions of views on social media, and prompted hand-wringing about the dangers of using this kind of technology.“I am President Suharto, the second president of Indonesia, inviting you to elect representatives of the people from Golkar,” the figure in the video says. The man behind it, Erwin Aksa, is a member of Golkar, the political party the former leader presided over for the 32 years he was in power. It is the nation’s oldest operating party, stemming from the New Order era, one of the most corrupt dictatorships in Southeast Asia’s history. The party was hugely powerful and influential, and all government employees were expected to vote for it.Turns out running a country is pretty easy, when you control everything. Golkar hasn’t had that kind of power since Suharto fell amid the unrest that engulfed the archipelago in 1998. But as citizens get ready to elect their next president on Feb. 14, Aksa said on Instagram that the video was intended to remind people of their responsibility to make the right decisions.Suharto’s appeal, despite his authoritarianism, is not new. During the 2014 elections, I travelled to his hometown in Kemusuk in Central Java, as millions prepared to directly elect only their third president since the transition from dictatorship to democracy began. It was hard to miss the love that many still have for the man they affectionately call “the father of the nation.” At the time, T-shirts featuring his face were being sold, with slogans in Javanese saying: “It was better in my time, wasn’t it?”This desire for a return to perceived stability is not unusual, but it is worrying given Indonesia’s importance in regional power dynamics. It’s the world’s most populous Muslim country, and Southeast Asia’s largest economy. It is a critical partner for the US in its ambitions to curtail China’s rise, and is also a valuable modern Muslim ally. A creep toward authoritarianism, however small, must be avoided at all cost.Indonesians look at their young democracy differently from the Western world, which has traditionally prioritized aspects like freedom of the press and checks and balances in government, argues Deasy Simandjuntak, visiting researcher at the Singapore-based Institute of Southeast Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute. They look at the government’s performance, and whether policy aims have been fulfilled. Social welfare and economic development trump democracy and civil rights — which is understandable when you look at the size and scale of the country. It is massive: From west to east it spans the distance between London and Baghdad, with three time zones and hundreds of different ethnic groups and languages. Even in one of the richest parts of the country — the capital Jakarta — very basic needs, like putting food on the table, can often be hard to meet.These levels of hardship provide an explanation for the rise in popularity of one of the presidential candidates in this election, Prabowo Subianto. He’s a former special-forces commander with outsized influence during the New Order and was dishonourably discharged in the aftermath of its collapse for alleged human-rights violations. For a time, he was Suharto’s son-in-law. Prabowo is offering economic stability and a continuation of the rule under the current leader Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi.Prabowo is leading in the polls, although early indications suggest a run-off is likely. Standing against him are two former governors — Anise Baswedan of Jakarta and Ganjar Pranowo of Central Java — who have yet to create much traction with the public.It can’t be overstated just how tumultuous the period preceding Suharto’s fall was, and the chaos that ensued in its aftermath. I saw the beginnings of the economic mayhem caused by the Asian Financial Crisis that culminated in deadly riots that eventually forced Suharto to step down. At that point, it looked like the scenario many of us feared could almost happen: the total disintegration of an impossible state that had been held together not by any sense of nationhood — but the idea that this disparate group of people spread out across 17,000 islands could somehow be united in a country.Much of that was down to the former dictator’s iron-fisted rule, and his use of the military to quell unrest. But Indonesia since has become the poster child for democracy in Southeast Asia, and has had a remarkably successful transition after the initial years of disorder. It was out of this new and refreshed political system that the president for the past decade, Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, emerged — ostensibly a man of the people, a democrat who was not connected to the cronyism and capitalism of the previous era.Prabowo, 72, and Jokowi, 62 are highly intelligent political operators with polar opposite public personalities — one a swaggering ex-general, the other a soft-spoken furniture maker. They each offer a type of charisma that appeals to a large number of Indonesians. Prabowo has his own party and isn’t even a member of Golkar, whose current candidate doesn’t rate compared to a long-dead dictator.Now, history is repeating itself. Jokowi’s eldest son Gibran Rakabuming Raka is Prabowo’s choice of running mate in what is  seen as a sign that nepotism and cronyism, hallmarks of the Suharto era, are returning to haunt yet another generation. Jokowi defeated Prabowo twice for the presidency, but they have since made a pragmatic peace and the former general is currently defence minister. The worries about the damage to democracy have led to rumours and speculation that high-profile members of Jokowi’s cabinet are considering resigning, although the president has issued stern denials.This kind of active resistance by parliamentarians and civil society is essential, and should continue. Indonesia’s democracy is in its infancy. If it was a person, it would barely be out of university, just starting to make their way in the world. Learning from the past is instructive: Bringing that period back is not.Karishma Vaswani   is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication"

Although current output is a tiny percentage of global supply, the nation is sitting on around 17% of known reserves, second only to China. It’ll take time and money to develop the mining and metallurgical skills needed to turn all that raw dirt into cash, but the rewards are there for the taking","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Vietnam’s hopes of becoming a production hub to rival China are showing momentum. A big boost will come as the nation leans into its untapped reserves of rare earths, even as it struggles to find traction in new sectors such as electric vehicles.Over the past decade, the country has built a beachhead in manufacturing, ranging from cars to electronics. Computers and accessories are now the largest export, surpassing textiles and footwear. The expansion of foreign assemblers like Foxconn Technology Group, GoerTek Inc. and Luxshare Precision Industry Co. mean that Apple Inc. products like Macs and AirPods are made locally. While that energy has spurred the birth of other businesses, some have stumbled. Electric-vehicle maker VinFast Auto Ltd., for example, last week posted full-year shipments that missed its own forecast by more than 20%.Although Apple now has 25 supplier sites in Vietnam, that still pales in comparison to 151 for China and 41 in Taiwan. A key reason is the high concentration of component manufacturers in China. The transfer out of China into India, Vietnam, and Mexico has largely revolved around the final stage of the process when devices are put together like Lego. There’s been very little movement at the other end of the supply chain, where parts like chips, magnets, and diodes are produced.Rare earth minerals are uncommon — though the moniker “rare” is debated — yet crucial to modern industry. Many have unique electrical and magnetic properties that make them useful in electronics, EVs, medical equipment and lasers.Vietnam’s abundance of these ores is catching the attention of its government as well as foreign leaders. Its own hopes for the sector are bold. From just 400 tons of rare-earth-oxides produced in 2021, output shot up to 4,300 tons in 2022. That’s just 1.4% of global supply, and far behind the 210,000 tons from China, according to estimate by the US Geological Survey. In July, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha approved plans to supercharge expansion, aiming to process as much as 62,500 tons of rare-earth minerals by 2030.During a trip to Vietnam in September, US President Joe Biden inked a deal with the Southeast Asian nation to open up to foreign investment in the rare-earth sector. Reducing reliance on China was the stated goal, as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington continue to simmer.So far, the Vietnamese government’s policies to boost capacity are a mix of carrot and stick. It offers tax incentives, a simplified licensing process and dedicated industrial zones. Yet it also imposes curbs on exports and has quotas on how much of the raw ore dug out of the ground must get processed locally, instead of sent abroad. That stipulation has already tripped up executives, with the chairman of one mine operator arrested in October and accused of tax evasion and illegally exporting raw minerals to China to avoid high refining costs.Soon afterward, Perth-based Blackstone Minerals Ltd. affirmed plans to secure the rights to mine the Dong Pao concession in the northwest, despite its local partner being among those caught up in the scandal. “Vietnam has the potential to be a significant contributor to the global rare earth supply chain and Blackstone remains committed to helping Vietnam realize this ambition,” it said in an Australian Stock Exchange filing.Vietnam’s aggressive plans are bound to hit such speed bumps. Foreign mining companies, which have the technical skill and financial capital to extract and process the ore, will be key to making it happen. And overseas interest remains strong right through the value chain. Seoul signed a memorandum of understanding to set up a  system for rare earths in order to offer South Korean companies in the automobile and electronics sectors stable access.These deals are as crucial to the broader economy’s future as any agreements for extracting and processing minerals. South Korea’s Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co., Infineon Technologies AG of Germany, and Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp. have operations in the country, chiefly to make semiconductors. More importantly, global magnet makers have been lured to Vietnam’s shores, too. Star Group Industrial Co. and Baotou INST Magnetic will soon join Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. with local factories.This is the right direction. While it would be easy for policymakers to lean on cheap labour and simple assembly to provide thousands of jobs for blue-collar workers, it has a much better shot of building a robust future by tapping into its unique advantage underground. In luring the companies that turn rare earths into electronic components, it can build a knowledge-based economy that’s much more resilient to changes in labour costs.Although current output is a tiny percentage of global supply, the nation is sitting on around 17% of known reserves, second only to China. It’ll take time and money to develop the mining and metallurgical skills needed to turn all that raw dirt into cash, but the rewards are there for the taking. Vietnam may never replace China as the global centre of manufacturing, but it has a good shot at being the next-best alternative.Tim Culpan  is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

With broader access to credit, private consumption, which is expanding 3 percentage points slower than the economy’s overall 7%-plus growth rate, could become more stable","(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Depending on whom you ask, consumer credit in India is either growing too rapidly or not trickling down fast enough. Bankers speak with awe of the industry’s phenomenal expansion, which is so fast-paced that the regulator is starting to get concerned. Fintech players like to draw attention to its lopsided distribution. The industry keeps chasing a fraction of affluent urban professionals to the exclusion of everyone else. Broaden access, they say, and the scorching growth may become more sustainable.For lenders, however, the problem with adding new borrowers is the incremental cost. The economics of even modest democratization — to a wider section of regular wage earners, for instance in factory townships — makes the concept a nonstarter.Take credit cards, of which there are nearly 100 million in circulation. It’s a small number for a country of 1.4 billion people, but double from five years ago, underscoring significant expansion. And yet, it’s the same group of 40 million well-heeled Indians who keep getting more cards. Fewer than 13% of Indians over 15 years of age borrow from formal sources, including credit cards. In China, the number is nearly 40%, thanks to a multiyear boom in digital lending before a regulatory crackdown on Ant Group Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., the two major players.During the pandemic, India saw an invasion of sorts by predatory Chinese lending apps, but the regulators have chased them away. Out of more than 60 banks in India, about 75% of the entire credit-card franchise by value is with just four — HDFC Bank Ltd., State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd., and Axis Bank Ltd. The reason more lenders aren’t interested in getting into the business or expanding it is that the cost of acquiring and servicing customers works out to about 6,000 rupees ($70) per client, including specialized software for collection and risk management. It isn’t possible to recoup this expense from the spending of someone earning, say, 40,000 rupees a month, middle of the range for what an outsourcing company typically pays fresh coding talent.But what if there was a way? Not with expensive credit-card architecture, but by employing India’s ubiquitous smartphone-based payment protocol that logged more than 100 billion transactions last year.Unified Payments Interface is used by 300 million Indians to instantly settle bills. Even the smallest of shopkeepers accept UPI payments. Alphabet Inc.’s Google recommended its open architecture to the Federal Reserve as a template for FedNow, the new interbank settlement service that launched in the US last year. So far, though, UPI users have only spent money they already have on deposit with banks. But now lenders have been cleared by the regulator to offer credit. Any person scanning QR codes at more than 50 million merchants will have the option of paying from a credit line, if she happens to have one.That still leaves banks with the original problem: How do they know if modest earners can handle unsecured loans, especially if they have limited credit history? “When you go below incomes of 100,000 rupees a month, the quality of financial services starts dropping meaningfully,” says Piyush Bagaria, a co-founder at SalarySe. It’s a fintech startup connecting with large employers’ human-resource databases so that employees who want revolving credit can consent to sharing their authentic wage data and employment history with lenders. After that they will use the SalarySe app to pay merchants over UPI from an approved credit line. “The line will be settled from next month’s salary,” Bagaria said.Banks will garner an interchange fee from merchants, though they will only earn interest when customers opt to settle in monthly instalments. Bypassing card networks will reduce the lenders’ cost of acquiring and servicing lower-income consumers. Knowing that repayments will be automatically collected out of a regular salary will give them comfort. They could offer credit lines anywhere from 0.7 times for those trying to build a credit history to up to three times monthly income for more mature clients. Credit risk will become more manageable. SalarySe, which recently raised $5.25 million from investors including Peak XV’s Surge platform and Pravega Ventures, has set itself an ambitious goal of bringing credit to 10 million salaried Indians in three years.This is just one of many models that will emerge over the coming months. After all, the whole intention behind UPI as a public utility is to foster experimentation in an open marketplace, where small startups have as much of a shot at success as large players. And Big Tech is already sensing the potential. Google Pay, which has a one-third share of money that moves on the payment protocol, has tied up with banks that want to offer credit lines. In early trials, Google has said that half of such loans went to people earning less than 30,000 rupees, and that a vast majority of these credit customers are from smaller towns.Consumer loans in India are on a tear. More recently, Paytm, the homegrown fintech pioneer, has pulled back from the buy-now-pay-later craze by slowing third-party bank loans on its online network by 4% in a quarter. Even then, the year-on-year growth rate is 56%. For the sake of financial stability, the Reserve Bank of India is trying to quieten things down by increasing risk weights and forcing banks to bring in more loss-absorbing capital.But even as it grows, credit can still become safer if UPI spreads access to a wider group of borrowers and draws in more lenders.The payment utility is already moving $2.2 trillion annually as people settle daily transactions with money they have earned. Letting middle-class households spend a part of next month’s wage over the network might help them deal better with shocks. For six out of 10 Indians, raising emergency funds from any source would be very difficult, if not impossible.

They will need to raise deposits aggressively or slow down credit growth to reign in a high credit/deposit ratio, he tells Moneycontrol in an interview. Edited excerpts:Do you think the interim budget is an important factor for the market?We don't believe the finance minister will announce significant reforms or new policy initiatives in the interim budget. The government will wait for a fresh mandate and let the new government roll out new reforms in the budget after the national elections. Thus, the interim budget will not be a significant factor for the markets.Do you expect more populist measures when the interim budget is presented on February 1?This government has stayed away from significant populist measures and we believe that next week's interim budget will not have any significant incremental expenditure on new populist measures.Also read: RBI allows LIC to acquire up to 9.99% stake in HDFC BankAre you happy with the corporate earnings announced, so far?This quarterly result season has been a mixed bag, so far. Even though banks' earnings in most cases have met with market expectations, the internals have been weak. There are initial signs of some stress building up in the non-secured retail credit apart from growth and margin pressure in the future due to the high credit/deposit ratio.IT companies have met their already low expectations but there are also no major positive surprises.Are you worried about private banks after the December earnings? Have you changed your outlook ?We believe private banks will face increasing pressure on either growth or margins or both going ahead since they will have to raise deposits aggressively or slow down credit growth to reign in a high credit/deposit ratio. We have lowered our holding in private banks during this earnings season.Also read: Race for TPG-backed Sai Life Sciences: Bain Capital likely lead suitor at $800 mn valuationMost experts see muted returns for the market in 2024. Do you feel so and why?In spite of the fact that we had a fairly strong run-up in 2023, which has kept market valuations elevated, we believe that the Indian equity markets can give low to mid-teen growth in 2024 on the back of stable earnings growth. We believe that after the recent run-up, markets might remain volatile in the short term.However, from a mid-to-long-term perspective, FPIs and DIIs will continue to put money in the Indian markets as no other large economy provides them with a stable and strong growth profile.Do you think the small and mid caps will continue to do better than large caps even in the current calendar year?We believe the extent of outperformance that small and mid-caps exhibited in 2023 compared to large caps may not be repeated in 2024. Quite a few mid and small caps today are trading at frothy valuations, which can lead to their underperformance in the near term.Do you see any major risk factors (domestic and global) in the first half of the current calendar year?The following scenarios are some of the significant risk factors for the markets in the first half of the current calendar year:1) If the markets begin to question the continuity of policies in India2) Any geopolitical event globally that impacts energy prices or logistics costs and goods movement3) If we have a credit or liquidity event with major global banks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

It has already blown past the Wall Street consensus over where the index will finish the year. On Wednesday, the gauge surpassed 4,867, the average level where forecasters in a Bloomberg survey pegged it 11 months from now.With the US stock market at a record, the question for many investors right now is how much firepower is left in the rally that began last year. Whenever the S&P 500 has climbed from a bear market to new heights, returns in the subsequent six and 12 months have been handily above average, Bloomberg Intelligence data going back to 1950 showed.BI’s analysis of market performance after the US stock benchmark hit a fresh high found the median forward six-month return was roughly 9.2%, above the median 6.3% return for all half-year periods going back more than 70 years. The same pattern is seen in forward 12-month performance, with median returns at 15% after a new all-time high versus just 13% in overlapping yearlong time frames.Elsewhere, oil rose to the highest in about two months as US inventories, Chinese stimulus and an attack on a Russian refinery ignited a rush of trend-following algorithmic buying."

The government is expected to realign focus on measures to stimulate consumer demand and spending, and rural development, which are lagging compared to urban markets.Currently, India’s consumption story is limited and in need of a boost. In a population of 1.4 billion, demand is mostly spread across about 100 million people, according to Aamar Deo Singh, Senior VP, Research, of broking firm Angel One. He said, “Two-wheeler sales, a key indicator of mass consumption, continues to remain below the pre-pandemic peak, indicating the overall struggle in increasing consumption across the population.”“Despite near-term weaknesses in urban sectors like IT, and startup funding challenges, the outlook on the longer-term prospects of discretionary consumption remains optimistic,” said Sheersham Gupta, Director and Senior Technical Analyst, Rupeezy, a brokerage.Budget might spur rural demandThus, the interim budget is expected to be populist, as the government will likely attempt to boost the disposable income in the hands of citizens, which will boost spending.One way of doing this would be by increasing farm income by increasing the MSP (minimum support price) of key crops, said Omkar Kamtekar, Research Analyst at Bonanza Portfolio, a stockbroking firm. Furthermore, taxpayers could be given some concessions or rebates, Kamtekar added.“Apart from this, the strong push towards infrastructure will aid consumption in general,” said Vincent KA, Research Analyst, Geojit Financial Services. It's worth noting that during elections, the government and the political parties tends to spend substantial monies, which in turn, can boost consumer spending.Also Read: Budget 2024 | Pre-budget positioning and tips for tradersHowever, boosting demand will come at a price. “The government has to manage the fiscal deficit as well, though right now that might not be the main concern of the government, ahead of the crucial elections,” said Singh. The fiscal deficit for the current financial year is expected to exceed 5.90 percent, perhaps even hitting the 6 percent mark.However, since the interim budget will be presented during an election year, there exists a possibility that it will not include any major policy announcements. “Overall, the interim budget could be an uneventful one, as high-profile policies are unlikely to be announced,” said Kamtekar.MGNREGA, GDP lift consumer spendsThe likely focus on rural development and social schemes, farm credit, PM Awas Yojana (affordable housing), food security, and higher allocation to MGNREGA, can increase rural income, which will boost consumption, per analysts.Studies have shown the positive impact of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) on agricultural wages, consumption expenditure, energy intake, and asset accumulation.Additionally, in October 2023, ICRIER, a policy and economic think-tank, suggested that the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme, that helps farmers with income support (added) raise the amount from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000 per family, which has not been implemented yet. This would also help revive rural consumption.Also Read: Budget 2024: Centre should increase FY25 capex by at least 20%, says CIIThe GDP is closely linked to consumption according to Barclays. “India's private consumption expenditure has historically been the dominant driver of economic growth, generating an outsized 58 percent share of GDP in 2022,” said the international bank.India's consumption profile has steadily increased its allocation towards discretionary items as the country’s GDP rose.For Indian households, the change in preferences became starker in two periods: 1988-97 and 2005-11. Both periods saw double-digit increases in per-capita GDP for IndiaAs the GDP and the per-capita income grows, Barclays predicted that there will be a stark shift towards more discretionary spending, compared to necessary spending.Consumption stocks to gain?The interim budget may give a hint of the incumbent party’s plans for its next term, if re-elected. Therefore, if the budget has positive signals for this sector, it might make consumption stocks go up, said Gupta.Besides policies, economic indicators, employment rates, and overall economic growth also fuel the performance of consumption stocks, said Parth Nyati, founder, Tradingo, a discount brokerage. “Positive economic trends often translate into heightened consumer confidence and increased spending, benefiting companies within the sector,” explained Nyati.He added that if the budget unveils favourable measures for the consumption sector, it could foster renewed interest and investment in consumption stocks.Also Read: Budget 2024 Expectations Highlights: Need incentives, infra support for pharma sector, says Granules India chiefAccording to Singh, the consumption space generated good returns for investors, with the Nifty India Consumption Index gaining almost 30 percent in a year. “Major heavyweights delivered a strong performance, with the exception of HUL, Marico, etc.,” he added.The outlookThe long-term outlook for the consumption theme appears promising, owing to increasing incomes, a young population, and an expanding middle class, noted analysts.Easing raw material prices, growing premiumisation across products, and higher ad spends are translating into volume growth, said Manish Chowdhury, Head of Research, StoxBox, a broking site..“The optimism (for the consumption sector) stems from the fact that people tend to spend more on non-essential goods once the average income reaches a certain level,” said Gupta.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Experts believe it is unlikely considering the interim nature of the Budget to be presented on February 1 due to general elections this year.

There might be allocations on subsidies for clean fuel initiatives. There are also chances of tax cuts on EV-related components and imports. Beyond that, we don’t expect anything major,” he said.Increased capexIndustrial stocks have been the beneficiaries of increased capex spending in the previous year.The BSE Industrials index gave a return of 65 percent over the last year.

This rally has been driven by increased allocation in infrastructure spending allocated by the government during the Budget of FY24.According to a Nuvama report, the government allocated Rs 14.9 lakh crore in the FY24 Budget to the infrastructure space which was 32 percent higher than the previous year’s allocations of Rs 11.3 lakh crore. Nuvama expects 15-16 percent growth in the coming Budget, which will boost the companies' order books. Kandpal expects a 15 percent growth in Budget allocations.Jefferies pointed out that the central government capex in the last 5 years has grown at 25.4 percent. The government has increasingly focused on manufacturing indigenously through schemes like Make in India, Aatmanirbhar Bharat and PLI schemes. The order books have zoomed between 31 percent and 300 percent for L&T and Siemens respectively in the last 3 financial years.However, some analysts believe the first half of FY2025 will be tepid for industrial companies due to an expected slowdown in project execution. Rajarshi Maitra, Senior Analyst at Incred Equities, said the project execution slowed down by 4-5 percent during the previous election years. The order book-to-sales (OB-to-sales) ratio is also expected to go down from 3x in March 2023 to 2.4x in March 2024, Maitra added. This slowdown in order book might result in lower revenue in the first quarter of FY25.Additionally, most of the companies are near expensive valuations, analysts also advise waiting for corrections.Kandpal said, “EPC stocks have not corrected so much, these stocks can be entered at more attractive prices. Buy in dips strategy can be used.”Kandpal said stocks like Larsen and Toubro (L&T), Siemens, ABB, Kalpataru, NCC and BHEL have been the biggest beneficiaries after the last Union Budget and these companies have been successful in securing new orders as well.Post elections fillipCompanies with sufficient order books can execute their projects as spending is expected to pick up after elections.L&T recently won a significant order which is valued between Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore from the Maharashtra government’s planning and development authority.Pandey also said that the EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) companies will largely benefit after the elections. He reasoned the expected decline in interest rates will cause the interest component of the companies to come down and the execution pick up post-election will make them look relatively attractive.Valuations of most of these companies have run up in the past year. Hindustan Aeronautics which was trading around PE of 14x in last January is now trading at PE of 33x. KEC International's PE zoomed from 42x to 83x in one year.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, they believe that any increase in allocation will be a positive surprise on this front and that markets will cheer.In the FY23–24 budget, the defence segment received an allocation of Rs 5.94 lakh crore, a 13 percent increase over the previous year’s Rs 5.25 lakh crore. Of this, the capital outlay for “modernisation and infrastructure development” was increased to Rs 1.62 lakh crore, 6 percent higher than the FY2023 budget’s Rs 1.52 lakh crore and a 57 percent increase from FY2020.While most analysts believe that the interim budget “is a non-event” with major changes to come in only after the elections, the overall expectations for the defence sector remain positive. “The government’s target is to become self-reliant and also make India an export hub in the long term. I believe investments would continue on the defence side as well, with increases in capex spending to be seen more in FY2025,” says Sneha Poddar, AVP Retail Research, Broking, and Distribution, MOFSL.Also read: Budget Snapshot: Defence capex sees renewed thrustIn the FY2023 budget, the government had specifically allocated around 68 percent of the capital procurement budget to be earmarked for the domestic industry to promote self-reliance and reduce import dependency; 25 percent of the defence R&D budget was earmarked for private players and startups.According to Amit Anwani, Lead Analyst (Capital Goods, Industrials, and Defence) at Prabhudas Lilladher, the industry anticipates some incremental allocations, if not large, in the upcoming budget for sectors such as defence, power, and railways. But more significant announcements may be expected only when the full budget is presented after the election. Anwani believes that defence capex may see some slight moderation from previous years. In FY2023, the defence capex increase was around 7 percent to around Rs 1.62 lakh crore, up from Rs 1.52 lakh crore in the previous year.“Maybe next year, if things are good, it could be pushed up to 10 percent; it could come through in the August full budget as well,” he adds.Sector optimistic, backed by strong order booksAccording to Dipen Vakil, Analyst, Aerospace & Defence, InCred Equities, while spending on foreign procurement has been increasing, the proportion has been decreasing compared to domestic procurement, which is good news for local players. By the end of the year, domestic procurement could increase to over 70 percent (from 62 percent), benefiting both defence manufacturing and allied industries. In a recent interview, the defence secretary also spoke about how, going forward, nearly 45 percent of procurement will be from the private sector. This, Vakil believes, could be another positive for the segment.In a recent report, analysts at Antique Broking said that they continue to be bullish on the segment and expect that overall for FY2024, defence PSUs will benefit immensely as the Ministry of Defence has placed multiple big-ticket orders, which has helped DPSUs like BEL, HAL, and BDL to bolster their already strong order book and meaningfully increase revenue visibility for years to come. “We continue to believe in the robust ordering prospects that are expected to play out in the medium term as India looks to modernise its armed forces and also scale up exports with an emphasis on Make in India,” they said.Analysing the playersAnwani says that the increased order announcements over the last 12 months have made revenue visibility very strong for defence companies for the next 3–4 years. “What we saw over the past three years is just the beginning, as the government is now focused on improving the overall defence manufacturing ecosystem in the country,” he adds. Analysts believe that any announcements of increased defence spending could aid the growth of these companies.HALHAL, one of the largest players in the space, has an order book of around Rs 80,000 crore, which analysts expect to increase to around Rs 2.4 lakh crore by FY2026. According to a report by Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, the company is also pursuing export orders worth close to Rs 70,000 crore, which will provide it with sustainable long-term growth.Going forward, domestic self-reliance goals, proven execution capabilities, and a healthy cash balance are positives for the company. HAL has also entered into a JV for maintenance, repair, and operations, for which it is working to develop new facilities. This, analysts believe, could help the company diversify its revenue stream further, providing long-term growth opportunities.In Q2 FY24, HAL reported a lower-than-expected earnings performance; however, analysts continue to be bullish on its growth trajectory, as it is one of the key beneficiaries of structural reforms in the defence sector. In Q2FY24, HAL reported a 1.26 percent YoY increase in net profit at Rs 1,236.67 crore. Revenue for the period also grew 9.5 percent YoY to Rs 5,635.7 crore. Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation were down 5.8 percent YoY at Rs 1527.7 crore for the quarter ended September 2023.“Once the execution of large orders like LCA (Mk1A) picks up pace, the company could post double-digit revenue growth in FY2025E, and it should stabilise at 14-15% sales growth from FY2026. Additionally, the company is debt-free and has strong cash and cash equivalents and healthy return ratios,” the report adds.Also read: HAL on course to re-rate like BHEL, says UBS; sets target at Rs 3,600BDLBharat Dynamics (BDL) spent around Rs 120 crore towards capex for the modernisation of plant and machinery and other infrastructure in FY2023. In H1FY24, the order inflow for BDL stood at Rs 166 crore. Major government order wins during this period included upgraded Akash missiles of about Rs 250 crore from the Indian army and unmanned aerial vehicle-launched precision-guided missiles worth Rs 110 crore.According to analysts at Elara Capital, total order inflows worth Rs 5,000-6000 crore can be expected in FY2024, including export orders. For FY2024 to FY2027, analysts say that BDL is aiming for an order pipeline of Rs 20,000 crore, “including export opportunities, comprising MRSAM orders for the Navy and the Air Force, quick-range surface-to-air missiles (QRSAM), Helina and Nag ATGM, smart anti-air field weapons (SAAW), advanced light torpedoes, and ULPGM.”In Q3 FY24, BDL reported a revenue of Rs 602 crore, around 30 percent higher than the Rs 462 crore revenue of the previous fiscal. EBITDA for the reporting period was up by 32 percent at Rs 119 crore, against Rs 90 crore in the previous fiscal. Net profit for the period also grew 61 percent YoY to Rs 135 crore in Q3 FY2024.BELBharat Electronics has also seen an increased capex of around Rs 540 crore for the modernisation of plant and machinery, test instruments, R&D investments, infrastructure, etc. in FY2023. The company is also focused on investing in R&D in diversified areas such as arms and ammunition. As of September 2023, the order book for BEL stood at Rs 68,700 crore, up around 5 percent on a QoQ basis.According to Elara Capital, BEL’s Q2 inflows give confidence in the company’s guidance for FY2024. H1FY24 inflows rose to Rs 15,400 crore (which is around 77 percent of targeted inflows in FY24). For FY2023 to FY2026E, Elara analysts estimate an earnings CAGR of 26 percent with an ROE of 24 percent over the same period. In Q2 FY2024, analysts at JM Financial noted that revenue remained flat at Rs 3,990 crore, and that “unfavourable conditions like strikes and delays in delivery impacted revenue booking to the extent of Rs 400 crore”. However, they expect revenue growth of 17 percent CAGR over FY23–26E, led by a strong backlog and a positive outlook for order inflows given the Government’s thrust on defence modernisation and efforts at scaling up exports and non-defence segments.Data PatternsOne of the larger private players in the defence segment, Data Patterns, incurred a capex of around Rs 74.5 crore in FY2023, contributing mainly towards expanding existing buildings and infrastructure and further investments in technological infrastructure. Data Patterns saw significant growth in its order book in Q2 FY24 (the company is yet to announce Q3 earnings), with new domestic orders worth Rs140 crore and export orders worth Rs 39 crore, bringing its total order book to Rs 1,000 crore.According to analysts at Elara, the company expects the strong new order momentum to continue with orders worth Rs 78.8 crore. These are orders where negotiations are complete but the orders are yet to be received. “Data Patterns’ order book is well-diversified, with 59 percent development orders, 37 percent production orders, and 4 percent service orders. The higher share of development contracts in the order book is a positive sign for the company, as it could lead to strong production revenue in the future,” the report says.On valuations, analysts believe some of the stocks in the segment may be overvalued and may be in line for some rerating. Over the last year, a large majority of defence stocks have given multibagger returns, such as Premier Explosives, which has given returns of around 287 percent, and HAL, which has given returns of 144 percent.According to Moneycontrol estimates, current defence stock valuations (P/B) are in the range of 3.71x and 18.51x. While some corrections and rerating are expected in the segment, most believe that as long as growth continues and the order books keep growing, stocks may not see any serious corrections after the budget is presented.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

But don’t construct a long-short trade either way. Macro funds work well when there are clear trends, such as the unstoppable dollar rally in 2022. As the Bank of Japan and President Xi Jinping keep markets in the dark, one can be caught out by either side","A macro hedge fund’s closure has sent shockwaves across Asia’s asset-management world.Singapore-based Asia Genesis Asset Management Pte is shutting down its macro fund after losing 18.8 percent in the first weeks of January from a wrong-way bet on Japan and China. Chief Investment Officer Chua Soon Hock was bearish on Japanese equities and bullish on Chinese stocks, and he was caught out by a sharp selloff in the Hang Seng Index and an equally impressive rally in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.Chua is no ordinary manager. He has a long, successful track record investing in north Asia. His Japan macro fund, which ran between 2000 and 2009, delivered an annualised 18.7 percent return and outperformed the Nikkei by 388 percent. From its May 2020 inception to last October, his latest Asia fund notched positive monthly returns 64 percent of the time. January’s sharp drawdown was, thus, cruel and unusual.Has Chua lost his touch? Why didn’t he put a stop-losson his long-short trade faster? Lingering questions aside, Asia Genesis is a cautionary tale to those who bet on political and economic events.Both Japan and China may be going through a structural break, in that what happened in the past no longer offers a window into the future. For now, macro trading doesn’t work, at least not in these two important markets.For years, investors were conditioned to brush away a run-up in Japanese stocks as another flash in the pan, while salivating at any rumour of stimulus measures from Beijing. After all, they were guided by trial and tribulation. In 2013, foreigners poured in about $155 billion, wholeheartedly embracing Abenomics. That euphoria evaporated as investors became disillusioned with a perpetual wait for structural reforms and for the Bank of Japan to hit its 2 percent inflation target.Meanwhile, Beijing has an enviable history of shock and awe. The shantytown redevelopment, a poverty alleviation program that replaced older, rundown dwellings with new, affordable housing, pulled China’s market out of a 2015 slump. The government’s decisive and effective Covid controls in the early days of the pandemic kept the economy going, while much of the world was in chaos.These historical lessons perhaps guided Chua and his strong convictions, even as many money managers were going the other way. “The Nikkei-Hang Seng spread has moved from -16,000 to +16,000 over the past decade, back to levels before China joined the WTO,” he wrote in the closure letter, referring to the relative outperformance of Japanese stocks.Chua was burned by the strength of hot money flows into Japan and too much faith in Beijing’s policymakers. In the letter, he marveled that Nikkei ETFs were bought at a 20 percent premium to their net asset value in mainland China, and said he underestimated “how long this will continue.” Meanwhile, “inconsistent market support from China resulted in the persistent and substantial down move in the Hang Sang Index.”To be sure, the possible structural changes may just be a mirage, and Japan and China will go back to their old ways. Hot money is fickle, while the Japanese may still stay away from their home market even with the arrival of tax-free investment accounts. At the same time, China’s stock market rout has become a political problem that may ultimately force Beijing’s hand. Chua’s vision may ultimately be proven right.This year, everyone loves Japan and hates China. But don’t construct a long-short trade either way. Macro funds work well when there are clear trends, such as the unstoppable dollar rally in 2022. As the BOJ and President Xi Jinping keep markets in the dark, one can be caught out by either side. “I have lost my knowledge, trading and psychological edge,” conceded Chua.

It is one of the most keenly watched sub-heads in the Budget.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the Interim Budget on February 1 as this is an election year. The full Budget for the financial year 2024-25 will be presented by the new government likely in July after the Lok Sabha elections.In the Budget for 2023-24, Sitharaman pegged the gross tax tevenue at about Rs 33.61 lakh crore with an implied tax-GDP ratio of 11.1 percent.The indirect tax collection was estimated at Rs 15.37 lakh crore in the budget estimate (BE) of FY24. Direct taxes comprising corporate tax and income tax were estimated at Rs 18.24 lakh crore for FY24.According to Emkay Research, buoyancy in tax receipts in the current financial year, led more by direct taxes, is likely to result in gross tax collections exceeding the FY24 budget estimate by nearly Rs 55,000 crore.Almost 61 percent of the gross tax collection target for FY24 was met in the first eight months, one of the strongest in years.On indirect taxes, Emkay said the average monthly GST collection rate in FY24 has been healthy. Assuming relatively slower growth in the remainder of FY24, the monthly total GST average will still be close to Rs 1.55 lakh crore, which would imply that total GST collections will likely match the budget estimate of Rs 9.57 lakh crore, almost 10-12 percent higher from the previous year.While bumper RBI dividends have been a big support for non-tax revenues, divestment proceeds have been meagre at Rs 10,000 crore, collected through minority stake sales.

""If the index advances, 45,300 would be the initial key resistance, followed by 45,500 and 45,700,"" he added.Firm treasury yields disappoint investorsRising treasury yields also contributed to the weak sentiment.

Run used bank cards issued by small rural commercial banks to buy cryptocurrencies through grey-market dealers, and capped each transaction at 50,000 yuan ($6,978) to escape scrutiny.""Bitcoin is a safe haven, like gold,"" says Run.He now owns roughly 1 million yuan worth of cryptocurrencies, accounting for half of his investment portfolio, compared with just 40% in Chinese equities.His crypto investments are up 45%. China's stock market, meanwhile, has been sinking for 3 years.Like Run, more and more Chinese investors are using creative ways to own bitcoin and other crypto assets that they believe are safer than investing in crumbling stock and property markets at home.They operate in a grey area. While cryptocurrency is banned in mainland China and there are strict controls on capital movement across the border, people are still able to trade tokens such as bitcoin on crypto exchanges such as OKX and Binance, or through other over-the-counter channels.Mainland investors can also open overseas bank accounts to buy crypto assets.After Hong Kong's open endorsement of digital assets last year, Chinese citizens are also using their $50,000 annual forex purchase quotas to move money into cryptocurrency accounts in the territory. Under Chinese rules, the money can only be used for purposes such as overseas travel or education.China's economic downturn ""has made investment on the mainland risky, uncertain and disappointing, so people are looking to allocate assets offshore"", said a senior executive of a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the topic.Bitcoin and crypto assets have attracted such investors, he said: ""Almost everyday, we see mainland investors coming into this market.""As retail investors make a dash for cryptocurrencies, China's brokers and other financial institutions aren't far behind. Starved of growth opportunities at home, many of them are exploring crypto-related businesses in Hong Kong.""If you are a Chinese brokerage, facing a sluggish stock market, weak demand for IPOs, and shrinkage in other businesses, you need a growth story to tell your shareholders and the board,"" said the exchange executive.The Hong Kong subsidiaries of Bank of China, China Asset Management (ChinaAMC) and Harvest Fund Management Co are all exploring businesses in the territory that deal in digital assets.ILL-GOTTENAccess to bitcoin isn't that difficult on the mainland, according to Reuters' checks of online crypto exchanges and interviews with retail investors.Exchanges such as OKX and Binance still offer trading services for Chinese investors, and guide them to use fintech platforms such as Ant Group's Alipay and Tencent's WeChat Pay to convert yuan into stablecoins with dealers, to trade cryptocurrencies.OKX and Binance did not reply Reuters requests for comment.Crypto data platform Chainalysis says crypto-related activities in China have bounced, and its global ranking in terms of peer-to-peer trade volume jumped to the 13th place in 2023, from 144 in 2022.Despite being banned, the Chinese crypto market recorded an estimated $86.4 billion in raw transaction volume between July 2022 and June 2023, dwarfing Hong Kong, which witnessed $64 billion in crypto trading, Chainalysis said. And the proportion of large retail transactions of $10,000-$1 million is nearly twice the global average of 3.6%.Much of China's crypto activity ""takes place through over-the-counters or through informal, grey market peer-to-peer businesses,"" Chainalysis said in the report.Brick-and-mortar crypto exchange stores, have sprouted in Hong Kong's busy business and shopping streets. These offline shops are lightly regulated.At Crypto HK, a popular crypto store in the Admiralty district, customers can buy cryptocurrencies with a minimum HK$500 ($64) and are not required to provide any identity documents.The underground crypto market in China is thriving.Michael Wang, a dealer who helps individuals buy digital assets, says daily volumes run into several million yuan or even dozens of millions.Charlie Wong, a 35-year-old buy-side equity analyst, bought bitcoin via the Hashkey Exchange, an officially recognised marketplace in Hong Kong.""It is hard to find opportunties in traditional fields. Chinese stocks and other assets perform poorly ... the economy is undergoing a crucial transition,"" he said.China's crackdown on the property sector over the past three years has battered prices of homes, which were traditionally the mainstay in household savings portfolios. The stock market has fared even worse, with the benchmark CSI 300 Index down by half its value since early 2021.Bitcoin, by contrast, has leapt 50% since mid-October, and is known for its wild swings.Wong believes Chinese officials are cognisant of how disruptive bitcoin can be and yet aware of its huge potential, and hence their endorsement of crypto trading in Hong Kong, to keep a toehold in the crypto business booming in financial centres such as Singapore and New York.Hong Kong, though autonomously governed, is a Chinese special administrative region.Chainalysis reckons the developments ""have created speculation that the Chinese government may be warming to cryptocurrency and that Hong Kong may be a testing ground for these efforts."""

Edited excerpts:Is the worst over for HDFC Bank?Post the sharp correction, HDFC Bank is trading at 2.1x its FY2024 book value, which is already at a steep discount to its average valuation multiples in the past five years. Hence, the stock has reached attractive levels fundamentally.However, the sentiment has turned weak and there are no short term triggers as of now. Hence, it could languish for sometime.

Initially, the management commentary and earnings from the large IT services companies was quite encouraging. Even the mid-cap companies like Persistent Systems and Coforge have surprised positively.On the other hand, banking heavyweights like HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have disappointed in terms of growth outlook and are a drag on the markets.

[.HK]Japan's Nikkei fell 0.3%.[.T]The strong U.S. data and a cut in Chinese bank reserve requirements, releasing about a trillion yuan ($140 billion) for lending, had cheered investors - lifting the S&P 500 to a record high and world stocks to a two-year peak.China's cut came on the heels of a collapse in China's equity markets that pushed the Shanghai Composite to a four-year low on Monday and hammered the Hang Seng. Along with a Bloomberg report that China is mulling a big rescue fund for the stockmarket, it seems to have stabilised things for now but without inspiring much confidence yet in the outlook.""This is not the panacea that will change the narrative too much,"" said Tim Graf, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa macro strategy at State Street in London.""More targeted stimulus would be a more powerful lever to push and they seem to be reluctant to do that.""The Hang Seng is trading 8% above Monday's 15-month low, but it remains down more than 6% for the year to date and almost 20% below where it began 2023. World stocks are up 21% since then.S&P 500 futures were 0.1% lower in Asia, as were Nasdaq 100 futures, dragged by a 6% drop in Tesla shares after the bell following earnings that missed expectations and a warning of a sales slowdown ahead.South Korea beat expectations for growth in the fourth quarter of 2023, though the Kospi slipped and the won was steady.YIELDS RISEIn currency markets gains for the Australian dollar on optimism that China is putting together a stimulus package proved shortlived. The Aussie handed back gains overnight and was down 0.1% at $0.6569 in the Asia morning. [FRX/]The euro was steady at $1.0875, while the yen was holding firm on the strong side of 148 to the dollar after hints at rate rises in Japan triggered a sharp sell off in the Japanese government bond market. [JP/]The Bank of Japan left rates on hold this week but governor Kazuo Ueda said it was looking more likely that inflation would sustainably reach the bank's 2% goal. Ten-year Japanese government bond yields rose 2.5 bps to 0.73%.Global bond markets have also been under pressure as traders pare back expectations for rate cuts.Wednesday's strong activity data drove two-year U.S Treasury yields from lows overnight and they were steady at 4.37% in Asia. The European Central Bank is likely to push back on investor bets for aggressive policy easing this spring at its policy meeting later on Thursday.Interest rate futures price about a 40% chance of a U.S. rate cut in March, down from 75% at the start of last week.""For you to get rate cuts in March, we need to see bad data next month,"" said Remi Olu-Pitan, head of multi-asset growth and income at Schroders at an outlook briefing in Singapore.""And if that comes through there's a problem for equities,"" she said, since they are not priced for weakness.The apparent contradiction will most likely ""normalise through bond yields rising,"" she said.In commodity markets Brent futures were 0.2% higher at $80.22 a barrel. Singapore iron ore steadied at $135 a tonne while London copper had shot to a three-week high on hopes of more stimulus measures from China."

The counters are also different. The ones beaten down most have low FPI ownership,"" said Nirav Karkera, head of research, Fisdom.Also Read: MC Explains | What are Sebi FPI norms and how are they linked to the market fall?Sebi initially estimated that the quantum of FPI stake that will have to comply with additional disclosure norms at around Rs 2.46 lakh crore. Sources at Sebi, however, told Moneycontrol that the amount was a conservative estimate. The amount was now significantly lower despite a significant escalation in the market’s overall market-cap, as more FPIs got eliminated on additional exemption criteria.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities, said Sebi norms could be one of the triggers but one must also note that FIIs were selling across emerging markets (EMs).""The global FII view is to reduce exposure to EM equities, maybe because they feel markets are overvalued. India is also at the receiving end,"" he said.During the January 15-23 period, the Nifty lost 4 percent and the Nifty Midcap 100 2.5 percent. FIIs pulled out Rs 32,000 crore and DIIs bought stake worth Rs 17,000 crore.After a very strong rally and the Nifty scaling 22,000, the markets had moved to an overbought situation and needed an excuse to pullback a bit, Gaurav Dua, SVP - Head Capital Market Strategy at Sharekhan told Moneycontrol.""The volatility in global markets and the post results correction in some heavyweights in banking sector seem to have provided the required trigger for the correction. The reports related to FPI norms seem to have only added to weakness in sentiments,"" Dua said.Stock-specific triggersMuch of the market fall has been triggered by negative news about specific stocks. Zee Entertainment Enterprises, for instance, saw a 38 percent drawdown largely on the back of the Sony deal fallout. Data compiled by Prime Database shows only two FPIs holding more than 50 percent of their corpus in Essel group, which amounts to total of Rs 63 crore. Zee's total market cap loss over this period is more than Rs 7,000 crore.In the case of HDFC, two FPIs have concentrated holdings — Aberdeen and Invesco — amounting to Rs 18,210 crore. Both are exempt from making additional disclosures, as per Sebi. HDFC Bank has fallen close to 15 percent after it announced its third quarter results as the Street was disappointed with its margin performance.Also Read: Expect some housing incentives in Budget, prefer private over PSU banks: Macquarie’s Suresh GanapathyOberoi Realty, which does not have concentrated FPI holding, has tumbled 10 percent in the past weak after its December quarter net profit tanked close to 49 percent from last year. On the other hand, Adani group companies that have highest amount of concentrated FPI bets have fallen between 2 and 5 percent.For several stocks, one cannot make a direct connection between concentrated FPI holding and the recent selloff. That said, the numbers could be an under representation of opaque structures as they include only FPIs with greater than 1 percent holding. Data for this study was compiled by Prime database, based on public disclosures.What are Sebi FPI norms and what are the deadlines?Sebi wants additional disclosures from FPIs to prevent companies from manipulating the rules on minimum public shareholding and also to prevent overseas entities from indirectly controlling Indian companies through a chain or web of shell firms.Disclosures on beneficial ownership have to be made by FPIs whose 50 percent of equity assets under management are invested in a single Indian corporate group, or FPIs that have invested over Rs 25,000 crore in the Indian stock market.Sources on January 24 said there is no immediate deadline or cliff for FPIs to liquidate any holdings.Also Read: Sebi FPI norms: Quantum less than projected, no immediate deadline to liquidate, say sourcesFPIs which meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of October 31, 2023 have time till January-end to rebalance their holdings, if they so wish. ""If they continue to meet the criteria for enhanced disclosures as of January end, they shall be required to make the additional disclosures within 30 trading days,"" sources said.Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they will have another six months to reduce their holdings."

So, what’s the way out? Rebalance your portfolio when markets swing wildly.","In 2023, Indian equity markets were the clear winner. The Nifty 100 index gave a return of around 18 percent, but mid-cap and small-cap indices gave returns of around 38 and 42 percent, respectively. On January 23, the S&P BSE Sensex tumbled by 1,000 points, or 1.47 percent. That's just a single day's fall. All these sharp movements, especially when markets rise the way they did in 2023, warrant a review, maybe rebalancing and shifting your asset allocation back to what is necessitated by your risk profiling and financial goals. Then, on days like January 23, when equity markets fall, your portfolio falls sharply. So, is it time to consider rebalancing your portfolio?Why rebalancing matters: Safeguarding your financial journeyRebalancing goes beyond mere adjustments in percentages; it's akin to recalibrating your financial compass. Here's why it's a crucial practice:Maintaining your risk compassAsset allocation is not a random number; it mirrors your unique risk tolerance. It draws the line between thrilling adventures and sleepless nights. A skewed portfolio tosses that line overboard, potentially exposing you to more risk than you bargained for. Rebalancing acts as a gentle tug back towards calmer waters, ensuring you stay true to your risk appetite and comfort level. It helps you reach your financial goals without unnecessary white-knuckle moments.Locking in profits, seeding new opportunitiesConsider equity's stellar performance as a bountiful harvest. Rebalancing allows you to reap the rewards by selling a portion of those high-flying stocks and funds, capturing profits in the process. Yet, it's not just about taking money off the table. The proceeds become seeds for new opportunities. You can reinvest in asset classes that may have lagged, such as debt or gold, creating a more diversified portfolio poised for future growth. It's akin to harvesting your windfall and using it to sow the seeds for a fruitful future.Discipline against emotionsChasing hot streaks in the market can be intoxicating. But the market, much like a fickle lover, can turn cold unexpectedly. Rebalancing injects a much-needed dose of discipline, preventing you from being swept away by emotional investment decisions. A measured approach keeps you grounded and prevents you from overcommitting to any single asset class. It ensures your portfolio weathers both sunny days and stormy nights.Also read | Equity markets under pressure: Should you tweak your MF investment blueprint?Your long-term returns get enhancedOver time, a balanced portfolio can potentially deliver better risk-adjusted returns, ensuring smoother sailing towards your financial destination.It keeps your risk exposure in check, preventing you from sailing into uncharted waters with an overloaded equity boat.And it helps you avoid knee-jerk reactions and impulsive decisions, keeping your investments on a steady course.Also read | 5 ways to strengthen your personal balance sheetWhen rebalancing doesn’t workTransaction costs: Buying and selling might incur some fees and taxes, but think of it as an investment in your portfolio's long-term health. If you particularly sell an equity mutual fund before a year, then you have to incur short-term capital gains tax.Potential missed gains: If a particular asset continues to soar, rebalancing might mean selling a part of the potential winners a little too soon.Timing dilemma: Deciding when to rebalance can be tricky. Too often, and you incur unnecessary costs; too infrequently, and your risk exposure might increase.Also read | 5 investment tips for 2024, irrespective of where the market isFour tips to stay on the right path of investment:Review regularlySchedule half-yearly or annual check-ups for your portfolio, just like you do for your health. This allows you to assess the drift and make the necessary adjustments.Time it wiselyAvoid rebalancing with every market hiccup. Focus on significant drifts, like a 5-10 percent deviation from your ideal allocation.Seek professional guidanceIf the complexities of rebalancing seem daunting, don't hesitate to seek the advice of a financial advisor. They can help you determine the best approach for your unique situation and navigate the nuances of portfolio adjustments.Rebalancing is continuous; not a one-time exerciseThe bull market might be tempting, urging you to ride the wave with an overloaded equity ship. But rebalancing is like being a wise captain, constantly adjusting the sails, ensuring your portfolio stays balanced and reaches its destination. It's not just about riding the current; it's about achieving your financial goals with a steady hand and a seasoned perspective.So, as we navigate the highs and lows of the financial landscape, don't let the euphoria of one asset class distort your carefully crafted balance. Embrace the power of rebalancing and navigate the ever-changing market with a balanced approach and a clear view of your financial horizon, especially in the new year when caution is warranted amidst unprecedented gains."

If the Nifty 50 gives a strong closing above 21,500, then there is a possibility of upward trend towards 21,700, with support at 21,300-21,200 area, they said.On January 25, the Nifty 50 rallied 215 points to 21,454, and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex was up 690 points at 71,060.

Also, the correction from the recent top Rs 248 had very thin volume, which hints that bears are losing steam. In previous trading sessions, the said counter has gained momentum, which is looking lucrative.On indicator, hourly scale stochastics has managed to make bullish divergence, which further confirms the bullish stance in the counter. Thus, we advise going long in the range of Rs 230–238 with an upside target of Rs 265 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 219 on a daily close basis.Dr Reddy's LaboratoriesSince the last few months, the counter has been respecting Rs 5,500 levels. Also, the correction from the recent top Rs 5,970 had very thin volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam.In previous trading sessions, the said counter has gained momentum by clocking 4 percent gains, which is looking lucrative. On indicator, daily scale stochastics has managed to make bullish hidden divergence, which further confirms the bullish stance in the counter. Thus, we advise going long in the range of Rs 5,850-6,000 with an upside target of Rs 6,350 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 5,699 on a daily close basis.Note: Hidden Bullish Divergence is Once price makes a higher low (HL), look and see if the oscillator (stochastics in our case) does the same. If it doesn’t and makes a lower low (LL), then we’ve got some hidden divergence in our hands.Borosil RenewablesJanuary 2024 has been fabulous for the said counter as it has already given 38 percent return in just one month time. Having said that still lot of upside potential is seen. On monthly time frame it has taken out previous 7 months candle. Also, volume is very huge from lower levels which is making it as a lucrative buy.On Indicator front, monthly stochastics has given bull cross just above oversold zone which further confirms bullish stance in the counter. Thus, one can buy in small tranche in the range of Rs 590-615 and another tranche in the range of Rs 550-560 (if tested) for upside target of Rs 750 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 499 on daily close basis.

A gauge of prices charged by companies for their products fell to the lowest level in more than 3-1/2 years, data showed.Investors are now looking to Thursday's first reading of the US gross domestic product for the fourth quarter, and another inflation reading — the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data — on Friday.The dollar index fell 0.4% to 103.1 after climbing to a six-week peak on Tuesday. Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has been up around 1.7% this year as stronger-than-expected data and a pushback from central bankers has caused the market to rein in its expectations for rapid Federal Reserve interest rate cuts this year.Analysts said the US currency is still in the middle of a correction higher, until the Fed starts cutting rates.The dollar fell 1.2% in December and 1.5% in November, as Fed officials made dovish comments that suggested the central bank was nearing the end of its tightening cycle.""The correction in the dollar from the decline in Q4 2023 may not be over yet, although momentum indicators are getting stretched,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist, at Bannockburn Forex in New York.""But I am not sure that we have broken out yet. I think we really have to get through not only tomorrow with the US GDP number and the ECB (European Central Bank), but also next Friday's jobs data. And it still looks pretty good.""Chandler added that the generally stable economic picture should be enough to reduce the odds of a March rate cut.On Wednesday, however, US rate futures market priced in a more than 50% chance of easing at the March meeting, up from late Tuesday's 47% probability, but down from as much 80% factored in about two weeks ago, according to LSEG's rate probability app.For 2024, futures traders are betting on five rate cuts of 25 basis points each. Two weeks ago they expected six.The Fed is set to meet next week and is widely anticipated to hold interest rates steady.The dollar was down 0.8% against the yen at 147.18.The yen's rally tracked the rise in Japanese bond yields, which leaped to six-week highs. Bank of Japan chief Kazuo Ueda said on Tuesday the prospects of achieving the central bank's inflation target were gradually increasing, adding to expectations that the country might soon leave behind its ultra-loose monetary policy.Strong Japanese export data on Wednesday added to the positive mood.ECB MEETING COMING UPThe euro was last up 0.4% at $1.0898 after falling to a six-week low the day before.It extended its rise after purchasing managers' index (PMI) surveys showed the euro zone economy's downturn eased somewhat in January, although it remained sluggish.The ECB meeting is coming up on Thursday, and the bank could give hints about when euro zone borrowing costs might start falling.Francesco Pesole, foreign exchange strategist at ING, said China's announcement that it will cut the amount of cash banks must hold as reserves in early February, in an attempt to boost lending and the economy, also helped the euro.""The euro zone is highly dependent on China, so it normally tends to have a good correlation with whatever happens (there),"" he said.The onshore yuan strengthened after the announcement, touching a three-week high of 7.142 to the dollar.Sterling also climbed after a strong PMI reading caused traders to further dial back their bets on Bank of England rate cuts this year, a process that was kick-started by a stronger-than-expected inflation reading earlier this month.The pound was last 0.5% higher at $1.2754.Also on Wednesday, the Bank of Canada held its key overnight rate at 5% and said while underlying inflation was still a concern, the bank's focus is shifting to when to cut borrowing costs rather than whether to hike again.The US dollar rose 0.2% versus the Canadian currency to C$1.3486."

The strong APE growth, coupled with steady margins, may lift the value of new business (VNB) - the profitability metric - by 13 percent YoY during the fiscal third quarter.India's third biggest life insurer is scheduled to announce Q3 results on January 25.According to an average estimate of five brokerages, SBI Life's APE is expected to come in at Rs 5,963 crore in Q3FY24 as compared to Rs 5,430 crore in Q3FY23. APE essentially measures life insurer's new business value written during the quarter.On the other hand, VNB is expected to be at Rs 1,702 crore in Q3FY24 as against Rs 1,150 crore in the year-ago period, according to the average estimates. VNB assesses present value of future profits associated with new business written during the quarter for a life insurer.ALSO READ: Union Budget 2024: Life insurers want tax-free annuity income, term insurance benefit under new regimeA healthy growth in SBI Life's VNB is also expected to help expand VNB margins by 84 basis points (bps) to 28.64 percent in Q3FY24, compared to 27.8 percent in Q3FY23.Gross premium income is expected to grow two percent YoY in Q3FY24, said analysts at Motilal Oswal. The firm’s first year premium will likely fall eight percent YoY, renewal premium will grow seven percent YoY, and single premium will clock a whopping 35 percent YoY growth.Some of the key factors to watch in the SBI Life's Q3 performance would be management’s commentary on product mix, outlook on VNB margin, and if there is any expected change in commissions payable to SBI.Further, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said that clarity on proposed insurance regulatory development authority (IRDA) guidelines on surrender penalty caps would be a key watch out. ""We need clarity on the final guidelines, estimated impact and the strategies to be adopted by life insurance companies thereon,"" they said.The cap on surrender penalty will limit the charges imposed on policyholders after they voluntarily terminate an insurance policy before its maturity period. In this manner, a policyholder would receive a higher premium for the insurance they paid and surrender charges would be waived off. This, analysts believe, could take a toll on insurance companies margins.In the October-December period, SBI Life shares surged over nine percent as compared to nine percent rise in the benchmark Sensex. On a yearly basis, the stock of this life insurer gained eight percent, underperforming Sensex, which jumped by 15 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index jumped 3.6% to trim its loss for the month to date to less than 7%.On Wall Street, Netflix leaped 14.2% after it said it added many more subscribers during the last three months of 2023 than analysts expected. That took precedence for investors over the company’s profit, which fell short of analysts’ forecasts.Also helping to bolster tech stocks was ASML, the Dutch company that’s a major supplier to the semiconductor industry. It reported stronger profit and revenue than analysts expected, and its U.S.-listed stock jumped 7.4%.Stocks have broadly rocketed to records recently on hopes that cooling inflation will convince the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates several times this year. Treasury yields have already come down considerably on such expectations, which can relax the pressure on the economy and financial system.The only question on Wall Street is when the Fed would begin cutting rates and how deeply it would go. Traders have recently been trimming their bets following stronger-than-expected reports on the economy, which keep worries about a recession at bay but could also add upward pressure on inflation.The latest signal of economic strength arrived Wednesday morning, when a preliminary report suggested growth in output for businesses accelerated to a seven-month high. Perhaps more importantly for Fed officials, the flash report from S&P Global also said that prices charged by businesses rose at the slowest rate since May 2020.The report did include some negative signals, such as delays in deliveries of supplies because of bad weather, ""but for now the survey send a clear and welcome message of resilient economic growth and sharply waning inflation,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.Treasury yields in the bond market pared earlier losses following the report. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.12% from 4.14% late Tuesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more on expectations for the Fed, fell to 4.33% from 4.38%.Economic reports coming later in the week could further sway expectations for rate cuts this year. On Thursday, the government will give its first update for how quickly the economy grew during the final three months of 2023. A day later, it will give the latest monthly update on the measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve prefers to use.Virtually no one expects the Fed to cut rates at its meeting next week, but traders are still betting on a better than 50% probability that it will move in March, according to data from CME Group.Until then, earnings reports from companies are causing some of the biggest moves.Elevance Health climbed 2.9% after it reported profit and revenue for the latest quarter that squeaked past analysts’ expectations. Kimberly-Clark fell 4.7% after the maker of Huggies and Kleenex reported weaker profit and revenue than expected. DuPont tumbled 14.1% after it gave forecasts for upcoming revenue and profit that fell well short of analysts’ estimates. It said it’s continuing to see weak demand form China, among other challenges.China's stock market has been one of the world's worst recently on worries about its economy, which has raised pressure on Chinese authorities to make moves to stimulate the economy. Stocks climbed 1.8% in Shanghai following China's move to free up cash held by banks. They're still down 5.2% for the year so far."

Weak global prices hurt exports for Indian steel makers.“Chinese steel companies have not been cutting production despite weaker demand. They have only cut it in the second half of the last year despite the losses. If the economic reforms lead to a revival in the real estate and infrastructure sector, then Chinese exports will come off aiding steel pricing across the globe and in turn helping domestic steel companies.” said Tushar Chaudhari, Lead Research Analyst, Prabhudas Lilladher.Pan Gongsheng, People’s Bank of China governor said the banks will cut the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percent on February 5, which will provide $139 billion in liquidity to the economy, according to a Bloomberg report.According to a Prabhuadas report, domestic demand for steel companies is expected to slow down in Q3 due to moderation in infrastructure spending due to election, hence competitive exports gave a good advantage to these companies.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

A decisive move above 21500 could potentially trigger a significant rally in the index. On the downside, support is situated at 21400-21350.

The tone was negative at the beginning however rebound in the select heavyweights not only capped the decline but also helped the Nifty to close in the green. Meanwhile, a mixed trend continued on the sectoral front wherein metal, energy, and IT performed well while banking and realty ended subdued. The broader indices also witnessed some recovery and managed to gain over one and a half percent each.The banking index tested its long term moving average (200 EMA) on Wednesday so we can’t rule out some consolidation. However, it would be tough for other key sectors to trigger any meaningful recovery in Nifty.

Soni Patnaik of JM Financial provides insights on pre-budget positioning","The Indian benchmark indices are witnessing a subdued trend on January 24, marked by volatility following a significant fall in the Bank Nifty, which witnessed a sharp decline of 1,200 points in the January 24 trading session.Looking ahead, market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming Interim Budget 2024, slated to be unveiled by the Finance Minister on February 1. As we approach this pivotal event, Soni Patnaik, Assistant Vice President – Derivatives Research at JM Financial, provides her insights into the pre-budget positioning:Rollover dataNifty January rollovers stand at 46 percent with a 0.8 roll cost, compared to 52 percent in the last series, indicating the unwinding of long positions. Bank Nifty rollovers are at 42 percent with a 0.9 roll cost, down from 51 percent in the last series, signalling a long unwinding.Addressing the weaker rollovers, Patnaik commented, “The Nifty broke below 21,300 on a closing basis, and the next support is at 21,000/20,950, below which it may test 20,500. As long as the Nifty does not re-cross the 22,000 mark again, volatile swings and sell-on-rise scenarios may persist. Therefore, it is advisable to hedge positions. Any small upside can be utilised to hedge long positions.”“The Bank Nifty broke the 45,500 level, and with the highest OI at 44,000 PE and 1.82 lakh contracts, it may test the 44,000 mark. Resistance for the near term is now at the 46,000-46,500 band,” Patnaik added.Pre-budget strategy Starting with weaker rollovers in both indices, it is recommended to hedge any long positions with a bear put spread strategy.The Bear Put Spread Strategy entails:For Nifty: Buy 21,000 Put option and Sell 20,500 Put option (1:1 ratio)For Bank Nifty: Buy 44,000 Put option and Sell 43,000 Put option (1:1 ratio)Read more: Budget 2024 | Pre-budget positioning and tips for tradersDeploying this strategy for the February 1 expiry in the Nifty results in a total premium outflow of around Rs 90, which is also the maximum risk. Similarly, for Bank Nifty’s January 31 weekly expiry, the maximum risk is Rs 113, aligning with the maximum premium outflow.Remain hedged with options buying strategies: Patnaik’s tip for tradersRemain hedged with options buying strategies such as the bear put strategy. Any upside recovery in markets can be used to hedge long positions, considering the weaker rollovers. The market seems to have formed a sell-on-rise structure recently, as FIIs' long positions in the F&O space have significantly reduced from 66 percent long to 46 percent.Avoid naked options writing due to volatile swings as the budget day is a significant event and any negative triggers could result in one-sided movements.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Under ordinary circumstances, these issues could have led to a bear market or even a severe correction. The challenges ranged from an unprecedented worldwide shutdown, historical levels of inflation and interest rates, liquidity problems, disruptions in global supply chains due to logistical crises, conflicts in major oil-producing nations, the real estate crisis and economic slowdown in China, and a confrontational situation between China and the rest of the developed world.Each of these factors had the potential to inflict serious economic damage, as was evident in most parts of the world. However, India has weathered these challenges relatively well.But despite being one of the strongest economies globally, certain Indian companies have not been immune to the impact of these crises, as reflected in their share price behaviour over the past two years, or so it seems.On an absolute basis, the benchmark index has given a 20 percent return in the past two years, but most market leaders and index heavyweights, the ones who have been spearheading market rallies earlier, have been underperformers.Infosys has delivered a negative 11.69 percent return while HDFC Bank is down 2.61 percent, Kotak Bank is down 5.19 percent, Asian Paints is 4.32 percent lower, Bajaj Finserv gave a return of minus 12.54 percent while Bajaj Finance is down 3.57 percent during the same period and TCS is trading 1.38 percent lower than its price two years ago.But for the recent rally in Reliance, the stock has largely been a non-performer. Reliance has given a 7.60 percent return, and Hindustan Unilever is up 6.88 percent in two years. Collectively these companies account for over 55 percent of the Sensex.A strong performance of smaller companies has pulled up the market. This is apparent in the strong performance of index components and those outside the benchmark index. During the same period, the mid-cap index has rallied 52 percent, and the small-cap index is up 33 percent.According to legendary investor Sir John Templeton, the four most dangerous words in the market is “this time it’s different”. But in the Indian context, it does not seem to hold true in the past two years. The benefit of the growing economy has percolated down to smaller companies, the result of which is visible in the market.Investing insights from our research teamAxis Bank Q3 FY24 – Steady amid mounting deposit challengesPolycab India Q3: Stay away till the dust settlesCyient DLM: No change in rapid growth trajectory, valuation supportiveSona BLW: In-line numbers, compelling bet to play the EV market growthWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: AK-47 has Rain in his crosshairs, contra view on Sanghi Industries, Zee drama—the next actMoneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | More weakness likely in days aheadAxis Bank’s balance sheet growth is not powering its profits yetSony needs to introspect on why it signed up to a merger of unequalsBudget Snapshot: What past performance tells us of market behaviour on Interim Budget dayDid the SEBI FPI ownership norm cause the market to fall?Union Budget 2024: Govt support key to India’s electrification story to continueIndian oil and gas firms must pay more attention to geopolitical risksElectronics — Let the export edge give impetus to local manufacturingA robust bus transport system is essential for cities to thriveMartin Wolf: The dangers lurking in our messy and unpredictable world (republished from the FT)Bihar: The Karpoori Thakur legacy and the BJP-JD(U) battle for the Lower OBC voteRate Cuts: The last mile of inflation has a bad reputationChina Economy: Hong Kong is facing a repeat of 1998 Asia financial crisisAwards shows like the Oscars are doomedPersonal FinanceAfter 80% returns in one year, does CPSE ETF still make sense?Tech and StartupsClient budgets delayed due to conflicting macro data, says Happiest MindsTechnical Picks: Escorts, Larsen and Toubro, Tata Steel and VBL (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).Shishir AsthanaMoneycontrol Pro"

The most popular one doing the rounds is selling by foreign portfolio investors (FPI) to comply with Sebi's additional disclosure norms.What are these norms and why has the regulator put them in place? We break it down for you in this edition of MC Explains:What does Sebi want from FPIs?Sebi wants additional disclosures from FPIs to prevent companies from manipulating the rules on minimum public shareholding, and also to prevent overseas entities from indirectly controlling Indian companies through a chain or web of shell firms.Also read: Sebi FPI norms: Quantum less than projected, no immediate deadline to liquidate, say sourcesWhat additional disclosures?FPIs need to give full details of all holders of ownership, economic, and control rights. This will help in identification of ultimate beneficial ownership.Do all FPIs have to make these additional disclosures?No. Disclosures have to be made by FPIs whose 50 percent of equity assets under management are invested in a single Indian corporate group, or FPIs that have invested over Rs 25,000 crore in the Indian stock market.Who are exempt from making additional disclosures?Sovereign wealth funds, listed companies on certain global exchanges, public retail funds, and other regulated pooled investment vehicles with diversified global holdings.Also read: Did the Sebi FPI ownership norm cause the market to fall What are the risks of concentrated FPI investments?Concentrated investments raise the concern and possibility that promoters of such corporate groups are acting in concert with FPIs. Sebi observed that in some instances, promoters were holding more than the stipulated 75 percent by parking their shares with FPIs friendly to them.""If this were the case, the apparent free float in a listed company may not be its true free float, increasing the risk of price manipulation in such scrips,"" Sebi had said.What is the quantum of FPI AUM that need to make additional disclosures?Back in March 2023, Sebi's first estimate was Rs 2.6 lakh crore. Now, sources say that it is much lower, despite a run-up in the markets over the past one year.Also read: Tatas, Hindujas among 40 groups with concentrated FPI holdings. Here’s the listWhat is the deadline to make such disclosures?In October 2023, Sebi finalised the standard operating procedure (SOP) for custodians to follow for enhanced disclosures. Existing FPIs, which were in breach of the investment limits as on October 31, 2023, were required to bring down such exposure within 90 calendar days i.e. January 29, 2024. They are required to do this only if they wish to do so.In case of genuine FPIs, unable to bring down the equity AUM below the prescribed thresholds within the timelines, they shall be required to make the additional disclosures within 30 trading days from 29th January 2024 i.e. by March 11, 2024.Even thereafter, if they fail to provide any details, they would have a further six months to reduce their holdings.What does it have to do with the market fall?Over the past one week, Nifty and Sensex fell close to 4 percent and many reports attributed this to FPIs adjusting their portfolios before the January 31 deadline.Is that really the reason?Hard to say. It is unlikely that FPIs waited till last minute to adjust portfolios. Foreign investors have sold equities worth Rs 27,830.34 crore over the past one week, much lower than Sebi's initial estimate.Genuine FPIs would not have any issue in disclosing granular details and would sell stake due to stock-specific reasons rather than to simply comply with the threshold norms."

The smaller indices, however, continued to outperform, with the Mid-cap index gaining 1.3 percent and touching a new high","Dear Reader,Indian markets had a tough extended week, comprising six trading days, battling domestic headwinds even as the US market continued to rise. Though the week started on a strong note, HDFC Bank, the largest private sector bank, announced numbers that were below market expectations. The stock was hammered and being an index heavyweight, it pulled the entire market down with it.  Indian markets ended the week 1.5 percent lower, while the US markets closed 0.7 percent higher.  HDFC Bank has been only an excuse for the fall, as Indian markets have been structurally weak for the last couple of weeks, which may likely continue.  Weakness To Continue Nifty has seen a sharp correction this week and has made a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, which is a bearish reversal pattern. In addition, the index has broken a higher top higher bottom formation on the daily chart by breaking the low of 21448. Friday's upmove should be viewed as a bounce/pullback. On the way up, a rise toward the 21704 – 21850 zone is likely to attract selling pressure, and the Nifty index should eventually break Thursday's low of 21285 in the coming days. The sharp decline during the week pushed the swing lower to 20 levels, an oversold zone. Normally, we see a 2-3 day pullback from oversold conditions. Since the Nifty index has broken the support line, the Nifty index can resume its downward journey in the days to come once the pullback is complete. Source: web.strike.moneyThe FIIs' positioning of index futures has taken a U-turn this week. At the start of the week, they were in a net long position in index futures by 81,695 contracts. However, they are ending the week with a net short position of 22,564 contracts. The FIIs typically take positions in the broader market direction and go from one extreme to another. If this pattern repeats, we can expect the FIIs' short position to reach 1,25,000 contacts to 1,70,000 contracts in the coming weeks, which will act as a headwind for the markets in the near term.Source: web.strike.moneyThe 40-day advance-decline (A/D) ratio nearly touched the second red line on 22nd December 2023. When the ratio hits the second red line, it typically indicates highly overbought conditions. Post 22nd December 2023, the Nifty Index rose higher till mid-January 2024, but the 40-day A/D ratio drifted lower, indicating the breadth is getting narrower. The 40-day A/D ratio has already corrected from a highly overbought condition, but it can go down further as the Nifty index has broken the trendline support.Source: web.strike.moneyIndices and Market BreadthBenchmark indices touched a new all-time high at the start of the week but lost 1.5 percent. Besides HDFC Bank-related selloff, the market was also under pressure because of escalating tension in the Middle East. The smaller indices, however, continued to outperform, with the Mid-cap index gaining 1.3 percent and touching a new high.  The star performers for the week were Oracle Financial Services Software, SJVN, and NHPC, while the losers were Vedant Fashions, Zee Entertainment Enterprises, and Sun TV Network. The Small-cap index touched a new high, though it closed flat for the week. Among sectors, the Private Bank index lost 4 percent, Media stocks were down 3 percent and Realty index was down 2 percent. Among the gainers were the Oil & Gas index, which was up 3.5 percent, and Nifty Bank index rose 3.3 percent. Markets were also under pressure as foreign investors (FIIs) sold equities worth of Rs 22,972.66 crore during the week. Domestic institutional investors were cautious and bought shares worth Rs 10,712.73 crore.Global Market The US market continued its strong run, thanks to a sharp recovery in frontline and banking stocks. Data on record online sales in December also helped improve market sentiment. Statements from Fed officials that interest rates would not be cut earlier led to some market correction.  All major European markets closed the week in the red as economists at the World Economic Forum in Davos pointed out that interest rates are unlikely to come down before summer or 2024.  Except for Japan, most Asian markets closed the week in red. Japanese markets touched a new 34-year high as inflation data showed prices easing. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) fund infusion failed to improve market sentiment in China, which closed the week 4.54 percent lower, while Hong Kong stocks lost 7.74 percent in a week.  Stocks to watch   Among the frontline stocks showing strong momentum on the upside are Tata Motors, TCS, GAIL, REC, Tech Mahindra, Cipla, and Trent. Stocks showing weakness are HDFC Bank, Vinati Organics, Navin Flourine, UPL, and VIP Industries.Cheers,Shishir Asthana "

With operational hurdles resolved and investors recognising the positive aspects of India's bond markets, HSBC Mutual Fund anticipates a shift towards strategic allocations by large global institutional investors, going beyond merely including them in their EM index allocations.""This, combined with approximately $50 billion from index-related flows, could potentially result in incremental foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows reaching around $100 billion in the next 3-5 years, while maintaining foreign investor participation at just 8-9 percent of the market,"" it said.India's growth trajectory remains robust, positioning it to become the world's third-largest economy by 2027.

India is poised to reach a maximum weightage of 10 percent in the GBI-EM Global Diversified and 8.7 percent in the GBI-EM Global index. Currently, 23 Indian government bonds (IGBs) worth $330 billion are index-eligible, with GBI-EM GD accounting for $213 billion of the total $236 billion benchmarked to the GBI-EM family of indices. Only IGBs designated under the Fully Accessible Route qualify for index inclusion. India holds a 'BBB-' rating from Fitch and S&P and a Baa3 rating from Moody's for its local currency debt.According to recent news reports, Bloomberg Index Services Ltd, a global index provider, seeks input through a consultation on including India's Fully Accessible Route (FAR) bonds in its emerging market local currency index. FAR bonds have no investment restrictions for foreigners.This inclusion signifies the potential for substantial incremental flows, as observed in China since 2019.

Earlier, Axis Bank shares hit a 52-week high of Rs 1,151 each on December 5, 2023.Analysts see credit profile improvingAnalysts at Jefferies shared a 'buy' call on the counter, with a target price of Rs 1,380 per share as against the last close of Rs 1,088. While Q3 profit was a little below their estimates due to weaker NII or net interest margins (NIMs), analysts still believe that the franchise is strong enough to deliver 16-18 percent growth in loans going ahead.""We could also see improvement in deposit profile that would sustain the return on equity (RoE) of 18 percent. We see a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17 percent over FY24-26. At valuations of 1.8x FY25 adjusted PB/10x PE are attractive and 20 percent discount to ICICI Bank,"" the brokerage firm added.HSBC analysts, too, remained bullish on the lender, sharing a target price of Rs 1,404 per share but cut FY24-26 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 0.3-1.5 percent. ""The EPS cut reflects minor adjustments to growth, NIM, and operating expenditure estimates. We expect FY24-26 EPS CAGR of 14 percent for Axis Bank,"" they wrote in a post-results review.Also read: As Bank Nifty closes at 45,000; support shifts down to 44,000; 'Sell on Rise', say expertsMargin pressure to continue till Q1FY25Higher cost of funds, however, contracted NIMs to 4.01 percent in Q3FY24 from 4.26 percent in Q3FY23. The cost of funds jumped to 5.35 percent Q3FY24 as compared to 4.34 percent a year ago, as per the exchange filing.Analysts at Motilal, thereby, cut their FY25 EPS by 8 percent, considering an increase in costs and margin pressures. The brokerage firm downgraded its rating on Axis Bank to 'neutral' with a target price of Rs 1,175 per share.Moreover, the management commentary suggested that margin pressure is likely to continue till Q1FY25 due to deposit repricing but the pace of increase will temper down.Elevated CD ratio may limit credit growthThe lender's loans grew 23 percent on-year in Q3FY24, led by the retail segment. Deposits, on the other hand, climbed by 18 percent on-year during the quarter.As a result, its credit-to-deposit (CD) ratio turned to be elevated at 93 percent as against RBI's comfortable range of 70-80 percent. This, analysts believe will limit credit growth going ahead.""We will keep an eye on the near-term growth as an elevated CD ratio will constrain credit growth, while continued re-pricing of deposits will likely exert pressure on margins in the coming quarters. The bank has a healthy LCR of 118 percent as it maintains industry best outflow rates. However, the impact of a surge in non-retail deposits will need to be watched over the coming quarters,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The Nifty till December 31, 2023 had been up by almost 12 percent from its October lows, which was a very ferocious rise in the Nifty. This one-sided rally in November and December of 2023 had come up along with the global market rally in the hope that we would have four rate cuts by the US Fed in the calendar year 2024.However, this scenario of a rate cut is looking bleak, as it is expected that inflation in the US economy will remain higher for a longer period of time. Hence, that assumption of a rate cut may not work out now. Therefore, we see a decline in the Asian stock markets along with the Indian markets.Also read: Sebi allows companies to offer OFS of shares to staff through stock exchangesMost experts were expecting the banks to do well this calendar year, but now they don't see the same scenario, especially after quarterly earnings. If you read my last three Moneycontrol interviews, I have been very bullish on PSU banks, and PSUs. This theme has played out very well for our investors. Currently, we have seen some corrections in private sector banks. However, PSU banks are still making new highs every day. Most PSU banks have given a return of 100 percent to 200 percent in the last two years due to the large valuation gap between private sector banks and PSU banks.However, after two years now this gap has reduced to a great extent, and we can see a reasonable rally in private sector banks as well, if the global market supports it.At this moment of time, HDFC Bank is around Rs 1,400 and Federal Bank around Rs 140, which looks extremely attractive for long-term investors. Also, in PSU banks like Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, and State Bank of India still look undervalued compared to their peers in the private space.Also read: Q3 preview: TechM to see flat revenue, healthy margin growth to boost net profitWhat is your take on the Zee-Sony merger deal called off?In my personal view, it is a very sad story for investors who invested in Zee in the last 2–3 years. They have been expecting this merger to happen under any circumstance, but it could not happen, which is making their portfolio bleed. On January 23, ZEE entertainment share was down by 30 percent in a single day, which can be a nightmare for investors and traders who had large positions in ZEE Entertainment shares.Moreover, Sony Group Corporation has also sought a $90 million penalty as a fee from ZEE Entertainment which will further put a pressure on ZEE Entertainment share price going forward. This kind of deals always shakes investors confidence in share markets, hence suitably dealt by the regulators.If you remember, in 2018, Zee share was trading near Rs 600 and today after 6 years it is trading at Rs 160, so even long-term investors did not make money in this stock, which makes me feel empathic for their pain.At this moment of time investors should be very conscious to select any stock in the midcap and smallcap space as apparently there seems to be a bubble in 70 percent of the stocks in these categories.Do you think that after reading the latest economic data points, the Fed funds rate cut may be delayed as well as the Federal Reserve may not be aggressive in rate cuts?Yes, I agree with you, after the latest data released by the US Fed it seems that the rate of interest will remain higher for longer. Earlier the market was expecting four rate cuts during the calendar year 2024 but now the expectation has been toned down and the market is expecting only 2 to 3 rate cuts in the calendar year 2024.Based on these renewed concerns on higher rate of interest we have seen that the US G-Sec yield across all tenures has again started inching up.Do you think the major IT companies will not see double-digit growth in revenue for next couple of years?Yes, I do agree that going forward it shall be difficult for IT companies to have double-digit growth in their dollar revenue. However, in my personal view IT earnings may bottom out in the 3rd quarter of financial year 2024-25. Also at this moment of time, we are very conscious of Nasdaq 100 from short to medium term perspective, which may put pressure on Indian IT stocks going forward.Are the rate cuts and reforms a great theme to own for CY24?Not really from a global market perspective, however, in India the reforms will continue to happen as the market is expecting a full majority by the BJP government in the 2024 Central Government Elections. As I mentioned above the rate cut expectations are bleak, hence, the market will be cautiously watching each commentary of the US Fed to ascertain the propensity of rate cut in calendar year 2024.Do you expect the government to consider the measures that can boost the rural demand, in the Interim budget?I'm not keeping any high hopes from the interim budget at this moment of time. However, as a trend we have seen that the rural demand generally picks up in election years due to extensive spending by the government and opposition parties.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

A year-on-year comparison of the bottomline is not applicable because it had reported a loss in the same quarter last year. Its net sales is projected at Rs 44,799.60 crore, down 18 percent QoQ and 13 percent YoY, according to estimates from seven analysts.Standalone volumes are likely to decline 6 percent primarily on account of a seasonally weak quarter. Blended realisations may rise 1 percent sequentially due to higher steel prices in the domestic market. However, with increased coking coal and iron ore prices, standalone EBITDA per tonne is likely to decrease by 14 percent QoQ to Rs 11,000 per tonne in 3QFY24.Analysts also anticipate international operations to post an EBITDA loss during the quarter on the back of a sharp decline in global steel spreads.Yes Securities anticipates a Q3FY24 performance similar to Q2FY24 for JSW Steel. The coking coal impact is estimated to be around $30 per tonne for JSW Steel's Indian operations. Moreover, the expectation is for the topline growth to remain relatively flat.ICICI Securities anticipates a 5 percent QoQ increase in India business volume, with improved margins due to positive price-cost effects. However, subsidiary performance is expected to remain subdued. Coated products may be affected by a lower CRC-HRC spread, and US subsidiaries could incur inventory-related losses amid falling HRC prices.According to analysts, the Chinese property market struggles to recover despite government stimulus, while robust demand persists in the automotive sector. Overall, subdued demand in China and increased exports at competitive prices continue to impact domestic realisations. Monitoring the resurgence of Chinese demand and the resumption of Indian exports are key considerations moving forward.Recently, JSW Steel reported consolidated crude steel production of 6.87 million tonnes for Q3 FY24, marking an 8 percent increase over the previous quarter and a 12 percent rise on-year. The surge in infrastructure projects drove metal demand. Indian operations operated at 94 percent capacity in Q3. In India, crude steel production rose by 9 percent YoY to 6.63 million tonnes. For the US-Ohio operations, there was a 191 percent YoY increase to 0.24 million tonnes, with a sequential rise of 76 percent compared to Q2 FY24.

The stock has formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily charts and saw healthy volumes, while trading above all key moving averages.Here's what Ashish Kyal of Waves Strategy Advisors recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Sun Pharmaceutical IndustriesOverall Pharma sector has continued to outperform since many weeks. Sun Pharma made a fresh record high in the previous session. The stock continued to rise despite of broader markets falling.On the below chart, we can see prices have broken above the upward sloping channel and shown strong positive momentum. The overall trend for the stock is positive unless we see close below the 50-day moving average which is near Rs 1,280 levels.In short, trend for Sun Pharma is positive. Use buy on dips approach to ride the trend with the target of Rs 1,480 levels. While on the downside Rs 1,280 is the crucial support level.Chalet HotelsChalet Hotels has continued to show strong rise since May 2023. Prices are still gaining momentum and is not showing any slow down as can be seen from RSI (relative strength index).As shown on daily chart we can see strong breakout above the channel and after retest there is again attempt to move higher. Break above yesterday’s high near Rs 775, the up move can resume in this stock for a move to Rs 810 levels. On downside, channel support is near Rs 710 levels.HDFC BankHDFC Bank has shown a sharp fall post the disappointing quarterly results. Since then not a single candle has given a close above previous day’s high which suggests weakness.On the below chart, the red vernicle lines represent 53 days’ cycle. We can see most of the lows are formed on our cycle and after almost every 53 period, HDFC Bank has shown a positive reversal. Currently, Time cycle of 53 days is due by January 25. So, post January 25, we can expect some buying.However, price action is a must to confirm the same and for that we need a close above Rs 1,475 levels. A close above it can suggest that short term bottom has formed.In short, trend for this stock is still negative. Any break below Rs 1,400 can drag the price lower towards Rs 1,340 levels.

It is likely to test the 50 DMA of 21,000, while 20,800 is the next support level.Therefore, we can expect some pullbacks from 21,000–20,800 area. On the upside, 21,500 will be an immediate hurdle, while 20-DMA round 21,700 will remain a key challenge.The Bank Nifty is a key laggard where it rejected its 50 DMA and slipped below its 100 DMA. The 200 DMA of around 44,650 will be a critical support where we can expect a buying interest.While below 200 DMA, it may further weaken. On the upside, 45,500 will be an immediate hurdle, while 46,500 will be the key resistance at any pullback rally.Here are three buy calls for short term:Zydus Lifesciences: Buy | LTP: Rs 729 | Stop-Loss: Rs 680 | Target: Rs 800 | Return: 10 percentThe structure of the counter is bullish, as it has witnessed a breakout of long consolidation formation with huge volume on the daily chart, while on the weekly chart, it has given a breakout of a Cup and Handle pattern. It is coming out of a long consolidation range with a triangle formation breakout on the weekly chart.It is trading above its all-important moving averages, with higher highs and higher low formations. On the upside, Rs 750 is the immediate horizontal resistance; above this, we can expect Rs 800+ levels in the near term.

The stock's structure appears promising as it is currently trading above all significant moving averages.The momentum indicators signal positive trends, with the relative strength index (RSI) showing a favorable position, and the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) experiencing an upward crossover at the centerline.On the upside, the key psychological level of Rs 3,000 holds significance. If surpassed, there is potential for the stock to reach Rs 3,100 or higher in the near to short term. Conversely, on the downside, Rs 2,500 is expected to provide strong support in case of any corrections.Global Health: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,130 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,050 | Target: Rs 1,244 | Return: 10 percentThe counter is in a classical uptrend and now it is breaking out of a triangle formation to resume its uptrend.

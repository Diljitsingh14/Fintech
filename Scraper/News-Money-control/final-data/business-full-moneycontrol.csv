Revenue jumped 15% to $9.9 billion and gross bookings rose 22% to $37.6 billion, exceeding Wall Street targets.Its net profit nearly tripled to $1.43 billion in the fourth quarter, thanks to a $1 billion net pre-tax benefit from re-evaluation of the company's equity investments.It posted net profit of $1.89 billion in fiscal 2023.Uber said revenue from its core ride-share business grew 34%, driven in part from ""outsized trip growth"" in Latin America and Asia Pacific markets.Delivery business revenue grew 6%, while gross bookings growth for the segment was the highest in two years.""Management took the intrigue off the table for today in saying it will address capital return more formally at the investor day, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson, adding that those plans are top of investors' priority."

It does not include payments for non-crypto-related crime such as crypto used in drug trafficking deals."

Nearly a fortnight after commencing the bookings of the e-Luna, Kinetic Green Energy and Power Solutions has launched the model at Rs 69,990 for the X1 trim and Rs 74,990 for the X2 trim (both ex-showroom Delhi and introductory).“E-Luna will definitely benefit from the iconic brand ‘Luna’, which brings a lot of nostalgia and positivity,” Kinetic Green Founder and CEO Sulajja Firodia Motwani told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interaction.She added, “Beyond that, E-Luna is a very differentiated product, which is clutter-breaking with a groundbreaking price. In my opinion, the product is as powerful as the brand. And I think it is a product whose time has come.”Motwani further said that nearly 50,000 units have been booked by B2B customers and there are 30,000 enquiries from B2C customers.The E-Luna, which has a 2 kWh lithium-ion battery, has a range of 110 km on a single charge. E-Luna variants will offer options of 1.7 kWh, 2.0 kWh and subsequently, a 3.0 kwh battery pack with a 150 km per charge riding range.“Today, there is a lot of interest in the market for Electric Vehicles (EVs). But despite there being many of them are either suitable for a wide variety of audiences or many of them are also not affordable to a wide variety of audiences. So, e-mobility is very niche, (accounting for) only 5 percent (of the total two-wheeler market). I think E-Luna can appeal to a wider demographic with its features. It (can cater to) not just to tier 1 but also tier 2 and 3 cities,” added Motwani.Union Road Transport Minister Minister Nitin Gadkari, who unveiled the model, reaffirmed that EV sales are growing at a rapid pace in the automotive industry.While delivering his speech, Gadkari said: ""What catches my attention about the E-Luna is not merely the fact of it reducing carbon footprint, but also its capability to penetrate tier 2, tier 3 cities and rural areas of India. That is where the real Bharat is!”He went on to add, “It is a vehicle that encourages geographical inclusivity. This is the inclusivity that will see Bharat grow, expand and become a leading economic superpower in the world.”Kinetic Green plans to invest Rs 100 crore for product development, brand building, marketing, etc., of this model over the next 12-15 months. Out of that, nearly Rs 20 crore has been earmarked for setting up a capacity of 5 lakh units of E2Ws (including E-Luna) at Supa in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra for this model.The Kinetic Green CEO said that the company plans to expand the E-Luna platform to cater to multiple segments. However, she maintained, ""Our focus would, however, remain on the scooter vertical. We do not have any plans to get into the electric motorcycle segment.”Sales targetThe Pune-based EV maker aims to sell more than 1 lakh units of the electric version of Luna in the next financial year as it aims for a four times growth in its turnover from the current Rs 350 crore to Rs 1,200 crore by FY 25. Out of the projected revenue, the company expects around Rs 800 crore revenue from the Luna segment alone next fiscal.""We are targeting to sell 1 lakh units of E-Luna next fiscal as we expect the company turnover to touch Rs 1,200 crore next year,"" Motwani told reporters in a press conference.When asked to share her thoughts on the current EV policy, she said, “I strongly feel that the government would extend the FAME scheme to push the adoption of the electric two-wheeler segment in the country. This is where E-Luna emerges with a price starting at an introductory ex-showroom price of Rs 69,990."""

In that circular, the regulator had mandated additional disclosures for certain FPIs who have a concentrated exposure to a single Indian corporate group and those who hold more than Rs 25,000 cr of equity AUM in the Indian markets, subject to exemptions.Difficulties facedRepresentations made to Sebi on the current regulations raised several problems. They said that there are difficulties in making these disclosures within the set timeline, especially with disclosures relating to change in beneficial owner.They have submitted that Public Retail Funds (PRFs) often have thousands of underlying investors and the holding of such investors in the FPI can fluctuate on a daily basis. Also, investors often participate in funds through intermediaries, and these intermediaries collect and verify client data.The representative said that, although such intermediated funds rarely have an investor who can be called a beneficial owner (who has holding over 10 percent threshold), monitoring this would place a heavy compliance burden on the funds and intermediaries/investors. According to the representatives, monitoring this would require exchange of data on a daily basis.Such granular data may not be beneficial to the regulator too, they added."

Over 68.5 crore tokens have been issued thus far, with 80 percent of transactions today utilising card tokenisation. At the Bharat Fintech Summit, P. Vasudevan, Executive Director of the Reserve Bank of India on February 7 addressed the audience regarding the growth of tokenisation and its benefits.In October 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed payment aggregators, wallets, and online merchants not to store any sensitive card-related customer information, including full card details. The 16-digit card numbers were replaced with a 'token'. The only way to conveniently make repeated card payments was through a new process called 'tokenisation'.What is tokenisation?Tokenisation replaces a debit or credit card’s 16-digit number with a unique token that is specific to just your card and specific for one merchant at a time. The token masks the true details of your card, so in case there is a data leak from the merchant website, the fraudster cannot misuse the card.Tokens can be used for online transactions, mobile point-of-sale transactions, or in-app transactions. A token contains no personal information and keeps changing, making it the most secure way to transact.Benefits of tokenisationVasudevan mentioned, that in the last 15 to 18 months after implementing tokenisation, not see any data breach or card data being compromised. It’s one of the biggest benefits or outcomes of this initiative. He added, the data cannot be misused even if the card is lost because the data is revalued for the tokenised card.“Then there is an upliftment in the success rate which has increased by 3-5 percent,” said P. Vasudevan, Executive Director, of the Reserve Bank of India. So, now the success rate is 93 to 97 percent. The transaction completion time is also reduced.“Now, we have card issuers, card networks and other service providers issuing tokens. So, now multiple channels are coming to create tokens which is another benefit,” Vasudevan added. RBI has proposed the introduction of a card-on-file tokenisation (CoFT) facility at the issuer-bank level, citing the growing acceptance and benefits of the tokenisation of card data.CoFT enhances convenience for cardholders, as they can get tokens created and linked to their accounts with various e-commerce applications. Since the tokenisation will now be effected only at the issuer bank’s portal or app, the risk of a third-party portal gaining access to your sensitive information in case of any data breach will be neutralised."

The broker shall attempt to sell the securities at the available market price on a weekly basis until the securities are disposed off. The proceeds from the sale, net of brokerage and statutory charges, shall be transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IPEF), according to the consultation paper."

That is an issue. We will see how they perform in Q3, Q4. There was no provision for capital infusion into them in the interim budget. If they perform well, the government may think of putting some capital in them,” Joshi said in an interview with Moneycontrol.So far, the government has infused Rs 17,500 crore into the insurance PSUs.“We have already infused a fair bit of capital in them, around Rs 17,500 crore. That has started showing some results,” he said.The Q2FY24 performance of the three insurance companies has been good. United India Insurance Company Limited has shown a profit of Rs 204 crore, National Insurance Company Limited (NICL) posted Rs 425 crore profit and Oriental Insurance Company Ltd (OICL) recorded a profit of Rs 180 crore.“These companies were in red last year with United India Insurance Company Ltd posting losses of Rs 2,800 crore, NICL of Rs 3,800 crore and OICL of Rs 4,900 crore.

Their Q3 results will come in a few days,” he said.Insurance Bill 2023Joshi said the government is holding internal discussions on the draft of the Insurance Bill, which includes composite licensing. The report on the insurance sector by the parliamentary panel on finance, led by MP Jayant Sinha, which was submitted on February 6 has come at a “good moment,” he said.The report suggested allowing composite licensing by the public insurance companies and strengthening them, which is already a part of the draft Bill.In India, as per the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938, life insurers can only offer life insurance products, while general insurers can offer non-life insurance products, such as health, motor, fire, marine, etc. The IRDAI does not allow composite licensing for insurance companies, which means that an insurance company cannot offer both life and non-life insurance products under one entity.“We will study the parliamentary report in detail. After that will decide what we can implement. We will take into consideration their recommendations. A few things that the report has suggested like composite licensing and capital requirement are already there in the draft Insurance Bill,” the DFS secretary said."

The MPC is meeting at a time when retail inflation has begun showing signs of easing but is yet to align with the central bank’s target of four percent.Earlier, bankers and economists who participated in a Moneycontrol poll had predicted a status-quo in key rates, while a majority of the participants expect the MPC to retain the policy stance as withdrawal from accommodation.Here are the five key things to watch out for in the RBI Policy on February 8:Repo rateThe repo rate, which is the rate at which the central bank lends short-term funds to banks, currently stands at 6.5 percent. Will the MPC change the repo rate in this round? Unlikely. Majority of the economists and bankers who participated in a Moneycontrol poll had said that the central bank will leave the key rates unchanged.Also read: Markets eye monetary policy for rate cut cues even as RBI will likely keep repo rate unchangedMonetary Policy stanceThe stance of the policy indicates the thinking within the rate-setting panel. An accommodative stance indicates the tilt is towards a rate cut while a neutral stance suggests rate action can happen on either side. Currently, the rate stance is withdrawal from accommodation. Some economists expect the MPC may draw comfort from a lower fiscal deficit, lower borrowing numbers and will change the stance to neutral.GDP growth targetIn the last policy review, the RBI had raised its GDP growth forecast for 2023-24 by a huge 50 basis points to seven percent following the big upside surprise in the July-September data. Will the RBI tweak the growth forecast this time?Recently, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said that the Indian economy is likely to grow seven percent in the next financial year 2024-25.Inflation targetIn last policy review, the RBI retained the retail inflation target for the fiscal year unchanged at 5.4 percent, despite uneven monsoon showers and as outlook on food prices remain on edge amid a spike in global crude oil prices.The December inflation number at 5.7 percent lower than market expectations. More importantly, the core inflation-non food, non-oil part of the inflation—has been easing. Will the RBI lower the inflation target further tomorrow?Last month, the RBI Governor also said inflation will ease further from the current levels.Also read: RBI monetary policy in February 2024 likely to be staid, but what comes next?Liquidity measuresMoney market experts expect the central bank to maintain liquidity stance tight this time. Also, they believe the RBI will continue extending the liquidity support to the banks whenever needed. In the last few months, liquidity in the banking system remained tight and the RBI had provided adequate support whenever needed with the various variable rate repo auctions.Usually that support was provided whenever there were major outflows from the banking system and overnight rates shot above the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) rate. Will RBI announce more support to the liquidity tomorrow? Let's wait and watch."

The company plans to leverage the government's PLI scheme to achieve this goal.,"Personal computer (PC) maker Lenovo is planning to start manufacturing servers locally to support its data centre business, leveraging the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for IT hardware.The company considers India a ""top priority"" international market and wants to use it as a manufacturing hub to export to other markets for its PCs and smartphones. It also wants to export solution-based services from India, leveraging local IT talent.""We have 35 manufacturing sites around nine countries in the world, India being one of them. We are constantly looking at ways to swizzle that dynamic, whether it's for economic reasons, logistics reasons, or sustainability reasons, to try to ensure that we're building products closest to customers,"" Matthew Zielinski, President of International Markets at Lenovo, said at the sidelines of the company's annual tech event in New Delhi.Lenovo, which has three manufacturing sites in India that make PCs and smartphones, is ramping up its capacity to drive exports to newer geographies. It exported around a million Motorola-branded smartphones from India in 2023 to other markets, including North America.""We want to utilise India's broader manufacturing sites to continue to export products throughout the world,"" he said.Vladimir Rozanovich, President of the Infrastructure Solutions Group at Lenovo, said the company aims to double its $10 billion data centre business growth globally. ""India becomes a very important partner for us from a manufacturing standpoint when we look at the entire Asian market.""Rozanovich said that it is currently exploring options between using existing facilities or forming a new manufacturing partnership to start the local production of its servers.""There's so much data centre-type business that goes on here (India)...over the next few years, we need to ramp up our manufacturing capabilities around data centre products, specifically high-end GPU-related products,"" he added.Starting November 1, 2023, India has implemented an import management system for IT hardware products, allowing companies to import products such as laptops, tablets, all-in-one personal computers, and servers without any restrictions for a year. However, after November 1, 2024, imports will be restricted each year in a staggered way. This system has been designed to provide companies that do not manufacture these products in India with sufficient time to develop local manufacturing capabilities.Lenovo is a part of India’s revised PLI scheme for IT hardware.Local sourcing of componentsThe company is also ramping up its ""localisation"" efforts by sourcing components for PCs and smartphones from local vendors.Amar Babu, President of Asia Pacific at Lenovo, said that the company has a ""clear plan"" to double the localisation content for its smartphones in the next couple of years. ""We are also looking at working with the industry bodies and the government to see how we can develop the ecosystem, especially for PCs.""Babu said that the component ecosystem for PCs and laptops has yet to develop in India, but more component companies are looking to start local manufacturing. ""We want to be participating here…we will have to look at all of these as part of our manufacturing strategy in India.""Lenovo now complies with India's preferential market access guidelines (PMA) and recently launched its PMA-complaint desktops. To participate in government procurement, 50 percent of the components must be locally sourced.“We are one of the first vendors to localise motherboard production in India. We are in the initial stages of discussion and working with the government to see whether we can participate in that business,” Babu said.Growth in India’s PC marketIndia's contribution to the global PC market has increased in the last two years. India's PC market hovers around 14-15 million units annually and is now bigger than Japan in terms of the total addressable market, Shailendra Katyal, Lenovo's India Managing Director, said, adding that home penetration, which currently stands at 10-12 percent, will drive sales of PCs, going forward.“The Indian PC market has been an outlier in the global context, with shipments sharply higher than pre-COVID levels,” Katyal said.Lenovo was the second-largest PC maker in the July-September period of 2023, with a 17 per cent market share, as per IDC. HP Inc. led the market with a share of 29.4 percent.Lenovo also expects Artificial Intelligence-enabled PCs to drive its overall sales globally, including in India. Katyal said AI will trigger demand in the country's commercial and gaming PC segments.The company is in talks with independent software developers and larger organisations in the retail and manufacturing space to create specific AI-based users in India, Katyal said, adding that enterprises are waiting for AI to mature, resulting in a slowdown in PC uptake.“No CIO or CTO want to sign off on a big asset refresh and then be saddled with inventory that is not AI-ready, which is where the hope is that in the second half, even the commercial demand should pick up,” he said."

The debt of state governments stood at 28 percent of the GDP.For advanced countries, the debt-to-GDP ratio also stands at 100 percent, Sitharaman said in the House, while pointing that the Indian government's external debt is ""na ke barabar (almost non-existing)"".The IMF report, released in December, explored various scenarios, including extreme possibilities such as events like the COVID-19 pandemic. It suggests a potential ""100 percent of debt to GDP ratio"" for India under adverse shocks by FY2028.The report also highlighted that, under favourable circumstances, the General Government Debt to GDP ratio for India could decrease to below 70 percent in the same period, countering any misinterpretation suggesting that debt would exceed 100 percent of GDP in the medium term.Notably, the government has kept the fiscal deficit target at 5.1 percent for financial year 2024-25. It also plans to bring down the number 4.5 percent by FY26.“The gross and net market borrowings through dated securities during FY25 are estimated at Rs 14.13-lakh crore and Rs 11.75-lakh crore, respectively. Both will be less than that FY24,” Sitharaman had noted, while presenting the interim budget on February 1."

Tesla sent out the single-line query for each job after canceling some employees’ biannual performance reviews, some of the people said.The ask was consistent with Elon Musk’s emphasis on cost-cutting efforts in the midst of a marked slowdown in Tesla’s sales growth. The chief executive officer is known to take an unsparing approach with the companies he runs — in late 2022, he gave Twitter staff an ultimatum to either commit to his “hardcore” ethos or leave.Tesla representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment. The carmaker’s shares extended gains before the start of regular trading Wednesday, rising as much as 3% to $190.61. The stock has slumped 26% this year.Tesla has roughly doubled its workforce since 2020, ending last year with more than 140,000 people on staff globally. The company employs about eight times as many people as it did in 2016, the year before the Model 3 sedan launched.Headcount increased almost 10% last year even as Tesla made select cutbacks. In February 2023, the company terminated dozens of employees in Buffalo, New York, who labeled data for its driver-assistance system Autopilot. The carmaker denied that it had fired the workers in response to a union campaign announced that week.Musk, 52, said during Tesla’s quarterly earnings call last month that the company was “between two major growth waves” — the first springing from its introduction of the Model 3 and Y, and the next expected to come from a lower-cost vehicle aimed for late next year.Tesla has flagged ample spending toward that next-generation electric vehicle and other growth initiatives, budgeting more than $10 billion in capital expenditures this year. Analysts also are expecting the company to increase spending on research and development to about $4.5 billion.With spending on capex and R&D rising, Tesla also warned last month that it’s approaching the limits of lowering costs on its existing lineup.“This is a constant exercise, and we just have to chase down every penny possible,” Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said during the company’s Jan. 24 earnings call. “We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this.”In a blog post on the job cuts in Buffalo around this time a year ago, Tesla said it rates employees’ performance on a scale of 1 to 5 every six months, and that it had scheduled “exits” for low performers roughly two months ahead of their reviews.Tesla has periodically done layoffs in the past even as it continued to recruit for certain roles. The company has hundreds of job listings on its website."

The weight-loss market today stands at Rs 474 crore against Rs 174 crore in January 2022, according to data compiled by research firm Pharmarack.“Strong scientific studies with robust outcomes have helped the molecule gain a strong position in the anti-obesity market in India,” said Sheetal Sapale, VP Commercial at Pharmarack.For example, the semaglutide tablets sold in India — Rybelsus (the product launched in January 2022) — reported a value growth of 142 percent and unit growth of 138 percent in January 2024, according to Pharamrack data.This product is manufactured by Novo Nordisk and distributed by Abbott in India. It had Moving Annual Total (MAT) sales of Rs 314 crore, according to January 2024 data.In 2012, a team of researchers at Novo Nordisk developed semaglutide for a once-weekly diabetes therapy as a longer-acting alternative to liraglutide. Currently, semaglutide is available in three forms: Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus. Novo Nordisk crossed the market value of over $500 billion, making it Europe’s most valuable company because of the bumper sales of these weight-loss drugs.The sole semaglutide product available in India currently is the tablet version of the drug, which is still under patent protection. “The outcome seen in patients was so good that we also saw some copycats enter the market, though they could not flourish,” Sapale added. Currently, semgalutide has almost 66 percent of the market share in the anti-obesity segment.Other peptides like liraglutide and dulaglutide occupy 6 and 15 percent market share, respectively. The rest, 13 percent, is accounted for by the molecule Orlistat, which is off-patent. Currently, various companies are selling generic versions of this molecule in India via 23 brands.According to the US FDA, semaglutide falls within the category of drugs classified as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. It emulates the action of the GLP-1 hormone naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract following food consumption. A key function of GLP-1 involves stimulating the body to increase insulin production, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Additionally, elevated levels of GLP-1 engage with specific regions of the brain and make people feel full.Sapale said that the increasing obesity problem in India opens up a slew of opportunities for the Indian pharma sector. Almost 5 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion population is morbidly obese. That is, around seven crore people are eligible for anti-obesity drugs, she said.This opens up a market to tackle concerns like diabetes, cardiac issues, kidney diseases, arthritis, asthma, and anxiety, which are the various complications and lifestyle diseases that could occur as a result of obesity. The market is poised for sustained growth, driven by factors such as the high prevalence of childhood obesity (11 percent) in India, indicating a prolonged need for anti-obesity drugs. She also noted that there could be a wave of products when the molecules go off-patent.Also read: Explained: What's Novartis' new anti-cholesterol jab all aboutRace for weight-loss products in IndiaAccording to available data, many Indian companies are in the race to enter the GLP-1 market. Lupin sells a dulaglutide product named Aplevant in India under a strategic collaboration with Eli Lilly.Earlier in June 2023, Sun Pharma announced results from two phase 1 studies evaluating the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GL0034, a novel long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, in non-obese and obese adults without diabetes.In October 2023, Dr Reddy’s Labs received permission from the Central Drug Authority (CDA) to carry out a bioequivalence study of semaglutide injection in India.Biocon and Alembic Pharma had also said that the companies are evaluating opportunities as they have peptide manufacturing capacity. Cipla had mentioned that, even though it might not be in the first wave of launches, it would like to enter the semaglutide market.Also read: Novo Nordisk's parent invests in India's Manipal hospital chain"

Both are part of private equity firm Advent International's India portfolio.,"Leading global private equity fund Advent International, which is spearheaded by Shweta Jalan in India, has initiated the merger process for its portfolio companies Suven Pharmaceuticals and Cohance Lifesciences and has picked two advisors for the proposed deal, multiple industry sources in the know told Moneycontrol.""Via the merger, Advent seeks to create a top end-to-end CDMO and merchant API firm which caters to the pharma and specialty chemical markets. Recently investment banks Kotak Mahindra Capital & Citi have been mandated as advisors,"" one of the sources said.CDMO stands for contract development and manufacturing organization and API is active pharmaceutical ingredients.According to a second person, “Work has begun on the transaction and going ahead the advisors will look at aspects like the merger swap ratio, fairness opinion and due diligence.”When contacted, Advent International and Suven Pharmaceuticals declined to comment; Citi and Kotak Mahindra Capital are yet to respond to Moneycontrol’s queries.On December 26, 2022, Advent International announced the acquisition of a majority stake in Suven Pharmaceuticals from the Jasti family. The private equity firm added that post the completion of the acquisition, it intends to explore the merger of Suven Pharmaceuticals and Cohance Lifesciences.""The merger will be evaluated by the board taking into consideration the strategic rationale and accretiveness to Suven’s public shareholders and will be subject to regulatory approvals and other customary approvals,"" the announcement elaborated.Suven Pharmaceuticals is a listed CDMO with a market cap of Rs 15,816 crores at the end of days trade on 7th February. On the other hand, Cohance Lifesciences is an unlisted platform which was formed to create a new brand entity for three formerly acquired companies, RA Chem Pharma, ZCL Chemicals, and Avra Laboratories in the API and CDMO space.It was set up by Advent to help streamline the businesses along formulations and clinical research lines, providing an end-to-end offering to its customers.Suven Pharmaceutical reported a sharp decline in its net profit, revenue, and profitability in Q3.""Near-term macro challenges persist due to industry-wide inventory de-stocking in Specialty Chemicals and impact of Covid Molecule in CDMO. This is likely to keep our next few quarters' performance soft. We remain confident about our medium term,"" Suven Pharmaceuticals said in its Q3 investor presentation.In related deal activity in the segment, on January 25, Moneycontrol was the first to report that US-based private equity major Bain Capital has emerged as the likely front-runner to acquire a majority stake in TPG Capital-backed Sai Life Sciences.The proposed transaction is expected to value the Hyderabad-based contract research, development, and manufacturing organisation (CRDMO) target at around $800 million, in one of the biggest deals in the niche segment, the report added.Additionally, according to a report by the Economic Times dated January 31, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) and UK-based private equity firm HarbourVest have held discussions to acquire a minority stake in Cohance Lifesciences.A Closer Look At AdventFounded in 1984, Advent International is one of the largest and most experienced global private equity investors. The firm has invested in over 410 private equity investments across 42 countries, and as of March 31, 2023, had $95 billion in assets under management.The firm focuses on investments in five core sectors, including business and financial services; health care; industrial; retail, consumer and leisure; and technology.In 2024, Advent is also set for value unlocking via stake sales in two key portfolio companies.Notably, the firm is exploring strategic options to unlock value in India's largest rigid plastic packaging firm Manjushree Technopak.Moneycontrol was the first to report that Advent International has initiated preliminary steps to explore a sale of top biopharmaceutical firm Bharat Serums and Vaccines.Other than Suven Pharma, Cohance, Manjushree Technopak and Bharat Serums & Vaccines, the India portfolio of Advent includes KreditBee, Yes Bank, Tredence, Eureka Forbes, Aditya Birla Capital, DFM Foods and Modenik."

But you can't say that you won't take a licence from DGFT (Directorate General of Foreign Trade) or not pay a duty after growing beyond a certain size,"" he added.Joshi's comments come at a time when one of India's premier start-ups in the financial sector space, Paytm, has run into trouble with its regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On January 31, the Indian central bank directed Paytm Payments Bank to stop accepting fresh deposits and making credit transactions after February 29. The payments banks has also been barred from accepting top-ups in any customer accounts, including prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags and NCMC cards.The RBI has said it is taking action against the bank after the Comprehensive System Audit and compliance validation report of the external auditors revealed ""persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank, warranting further supervisory action"".""Fintechs are very good in technology and innovations. They are young entrepreneurs, they have an idea, and get backing from angel investors,"" Joshi told Moneycontrol.""But they are small (to begin with). As they grow, they have to start interacting with the government and regulators. Suppose I am an MFI (microfinance institution) and I start an NGO and give loans to people in villages. I don't need a licence for that. But as soon as I become Rs 100 crore in terms of size, then I will have to go to the RBI. Then I can't say 'I did great work until now and will continue to do so'. I'll have to follow the law of the land,"" the secretary added.Also Read: Tough times ahead for Paytm's bank as RBI gives no concessionsPlayers in the fintech space have been made to increasingly follow regulations in both letter and spirit by the RBI. For instance, in August 2022, the central bank barred third-party accounts including prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) such as prepaid cards and wallets from the flow of lending and said that any loan remittances and repayments should be made only between the customer's and lender's bank accounts.More recently, in September 2023, the risk weights on unsecured retail loans were increased to clamp down on the rapid credit growth in this segment, which experts say has been aided by the ease and convenience provided by new-age digital lending platforms. As a result of the higher risk weights, digital lending through fintech platforms slowed down as they required greater amounts of capital, affecting the entities in this space that have grown quickly on the back of commission revenue."

A brief statement from the official Xinhua News Agency said Wu Qing, a banking industry veteran and former vice mayor of the financial hub of Shanghai, was taking the Communist Party and government positions formerly held by Yi Huiman.Chinese stocks sank Monday to 5-year lows despite a pledge by market regulators to crack down on stock price manipulation and malicious short selling. The markets in Shanghai and its smaller partner in Shenzhen near Hong Kong have languished on heavy selling of property shares, which are undergoing major uncertainty with a plunge in the real estate market. Top Chinese shares fell by 11.4% last year, while Hong Kong's index sank by nearly 14%. The ailing economy prompted thousands of people to vent their frustrations on the U.S. Embassy's social media site by adding comments about the stock market's woes to a seemingly unrelated post about protection of giraffes, reflecting the narrow scope for expression in China's Communist Party-controlled media environment.Major players in the housing and construction field that fed China's dynamic growth over recent decades have accumulated massive debts, making them unable to deliver apartments to buyers who have already paid for them with their lifesavings, as well as to repay banks and investors. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that China's economy will expand 4.6% this year, down from 5.2% in 2023. It noted that housing starts had fallen more than 60% from pre-pandemic levels after a crackdown on excessive borrowing that began in 2020.That's a pace only seen in the largest housing busts in cross-country experience in the last three decades, it said. China is moving to increase the supply of affordable housing and spur demand, just weeks before top officials gather in Beijing for the annual meeting of the national congress, a time when the Communist Party seeks to showcase its leadership and set new financial targets.That image has been tarnished in recent years by an erratic and often heavy-handed approach to COVID-19, including monthslong lockdowns that drastically restricted travel and work for tens of millions of people. The crash of the property sector and high unemployment among educated young people have been exacerbated by a shortage of labor in manufacturing and a sharp drop in the birthrate. China, once the world's most populous nation, relinquished that title to India last year and the pace of urbanization has slowed as the ranks of the elderly have expanded. The real estate industry's woes have been highlighted by an order by a Hong Kong court for the liquidation of China Evergrande, the world's most heavily indebted developer with more than $300 billion in liabilities.China's property sector accounts for nearly a third of the country's economic activity and the industry-wide meltdown has weighed on growth and sapped the confidence of both investors and consumers. Many developers are insolvent but are avoiding bankruptcy because accounting rules allow them to delay booking losses on their loans. The government recently expanded access to loans to help developers recover from the downturn.Home ownership in China has vastly expanded over the past few decades after a sweeping housing reform that gave workers ownership of homes that were previously assigned to them by the state-owned companies and agencies that once employed most city dwellers in the formerly centrally planned economy. The home ownership rate in China is about 90%, much higher than in many Western countries."

In it, New Delhi stated, ""Don't take unilateral measures in the guise of environmental measures, since it has trade implications,"" said the official.Further weighing in on emerging trade issues like the carbon tax, the official said, ""Any unilateral measures taken to combat climate change should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on global trade.""The second official said that India is engaging in bilateral discussions on the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in a bid to ease the implementation process for the domestic industry. This carbon tax requires importers, as of 2026, to purchase certificates equivalent to the weekly EU carbon price.The CBAM initially applies to imports in five emissions-intensive sectors deemed at greater risk of carbon leakage: cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertilisers, and electricity. The CBAM charge covers imports of these goods from all third countries other than those included in the ETS (Emissions Trading System) or a linked mechanism."

In November 2023, Indus Appstore announced a tie-up to include apps from prominent real-money game developers Dream11, Nazara Technologies, Gameskraft and Mobile Premier League (MPL).Indus Appstore allows Android developers to list their apps in 12 Indian languages apart from English, as well as upload media and videos to their app listings in these languages.More importantly, the app marketplace will charge a zero percent fee on in-app purchases compared to the 15-30 percent fee levied by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.In October 2023, PhonePe said that the app listings on the platform would be free for the first year, following which a ""nominal"" annual fee would be charged. Developers will also be able to integrate any payment gateway of their choice on the platform, PhonePe co-founder Sameer Nigam said at the time.Indus Appstore claims to offer 24x7 dedicated India-based support via email or chatbot with ""assured assistance and quick resolution of queries"", in a bid to address a common pain point that developers have often faced with Google and Apple. The platform will also offer dedicated account managers.Read: Rakesh Deshmukh steps down as CEO of PhonePe-owned Indus OSConsumer app launchPhonePe had struck partnerships with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Nokia and Lava to integrate the app store into their devices as of November 2023.The app is also expected to be available on the Indus Appstore website and consumers can download and sideload the app on their smartphones. It will also offer a mobile number-based login system to attract consumers without email accounts. On its website, the company says it will provide a ""localised, contextual and a personalised"" experience to users.This launch comes at a time when Google is facing regulatory scrutiny over the business practices of their app marketplace Google Play in India and several other markets.Read: Google to start levying service fee on real-money gaming appsIn October 2022, the Competition Commission of India directed Google to allow third-party app stores on Google Play as part of the corrective measures in its antitrust ruling. However, the National Company Law Appellate (NCLAT) subsequently set aside this direction in March 2023.In recent years, Google has also faced intense backlash from Indian developers over its app policies, particularly after the search giant's announcement in October 2020 that it will begin enforcing a mandatory integration of its Play billing system across the world. Several app developers have mentioned that these commission fees are ""extremely high"" and ""unfair"".Since then, Google has taken several steps to modify its policies, including lowering its commission fee and introducing third-party billing for in-app purchases. The tech giant claims that these changes comply with the CCI's order, but many local app developers disagree and have challenged it in court.On its website, Indus Appstore claims this launch addresses the ""pressing need for a homegrown app store built for the unique preferences of the Indian ecosystem."""

With a keen focus on real-world impact, Nadella explores the rapid diffusion of AI across sectors and its transformative potential for economic productivity and societal inclusion. Excerpts:Q) It's great to see you back in India. We were here in this same room exactly a year ago, Satya, where the big breakout moment for ChatGPT had happened, and I know you were excited about it. But in the last 12 months, it's almost as if no one can talk about anything else, but AI, whether it addresses climate change or cancer. It's the sort of elixir that everyone is talking about. Between the headlines and the hyperbole, where are we on the journey today? And more importantly, over the next five years, where do you believe we will be?A) First of all, Shereen, it's fantastic to be back in India and to be with you. And you're right. I mean, a lot has happened even since last year. I was very excited about sort of the prospect of what AI could mean. I was very stunned even at that point seeing how some of the leading model work we had done was diffusing in India, and even in, you know, something like the public sector, right? That was the first time I saw Bhashini's demo, coupled with GPT4. And I was like, really, it was a drop-the-mic moment for me. And to come back a year later, and we're no longer just talking about AI. I mean, some of the use cases I talked about this morning, I saw from customers, you know, commercial customers, nonprofit organizations, I think this is the fastest rate of diffusion of anything new I've ever seen. And to your point, why is this excitement? Because I think it's tangibly changing economic productivity, whether it's for software development, frontline work in retail and healthcare, whether it's access for a citizen, a rural, you know, say a new immigrant into the urban area in India to be able to access services. I've not seen a general-purpose technology like this that can have that type of broad impact, and that's where I think the excitement comes from.Also read: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says AI has bridged gap between India and the worldQ) Well, speaking about the excitement, Satya, you know, let's also talk about the disruption because while we are talking about productivity gains, and what this does to workflow, what will it do to the workforce is the question, and where do you stand on that?A) Yeah, first of all, at the core level, I think we should go back to the lump of labor fallacy. I think labor markets are a lot more dynamic than we give them credit to. But at the same time, we should be clear-eyed about any displacement. So couple of things that we can do. One is skilling.One good thing about this generation of AI is it reduces the learning curve, not increases the learning curve. So even for somebody displaced mid-career, you can pick up new skills faster, and easily. So that's sort of one. The second thing it does is it sort of..., if the previous era was about information at your fingertips, I think of the AI era as expertise at your fingertips.So you can take somebody who's in the frontline, whether it's in retail or whether it is in healthcare, it perhaps will even improve the wages because they are now able to give more expert health advice or more expert work is being done by non-experts. They may have domain expertise, but they may not have all the knowledge. And so, therefore, I think that there could even be better wage support in new jobs.One of the coolest examples I saw it right here in India it was sort of incubated in MSR, and after that the founder of Karya took it and created Karya, which is about taking AI jobs. These are new jobs that didn't exist around labeling data and what have you, that are now being essentially syndicated out to rural India, where women mostly can find wage support, better wages, 20x wages compared to what is the general wage for doing AI jobs. So I think we will have new jobs, your ability to go up the learning curve will be faster and better, and even better wage support for some of the things that are on the frontline.Q) But in the short term, do you believe that we are going to see more job losses than we do see job creation? Because we have already started to see companies talking about restructuring on account of adopting AI.A) Yeah. I think what is happening, some of it is just adjustment. I think this is where I think, as I say, labor markets are just, right? If you take, take software development. The reality is there is a need for more software developers all over the economy, not just in the tech sector. So that's where I think if there is one sector that is getting ""more efficient,"" some of the labor force in that sector will disperse more broadly, I think. So I think that, yes, I'm not at all saying that there is not going to be displacement, like with any new technology, we've seen it. But I also am very optimistic that we have both the policy tools and the actual tools to help us manage this transition in a net positive way for even a country like India.Q) Speaking about managing this transition, what is it going to mean in terms of investments, Satya? At a company level, let's talk about Microsoft, you did talk about disproportionately investing in building out AI across your tech stack. And for the industry in general, what are we talking about in terms of investments?A) Yeah, so for us, we're very, very excited by what we're seeing in India. At the end of the day, we are putting our capital, we are building out our own data centers, we have four regions, we'll keep expanding that. We're investing in our people here, both India as a source of human capital that's producing products for us all over the world, and also us helping customers, the IT services companies that serve the world from here, equipping them with the latest and greatest.So that's, I think, I would call it the core of what we do. But beyond that, I would say the investment here is if you have a new general-purpose technology, India has a tremendous opportunity to use it in a broad sectoral way, public and private sector across every industry, healthcare, retail energy, what have you. We want to make sure that we are there. You know, we talk a lot about co-pilots, and I want us to be the co-pilot for India as it takes advantage of AI, creates, in fact, its own AI products across all of these sectors, and exports them to the world.Q) Do you have a number of what it will take for Microsoft to invest here in India, and also what Indian companies will need to do in terms of further investments?A) I think the economic data I've seen is if the Indian economy is going to be, let's say, 5 trillion, the AI-driven part of it could be something like maybe 10% of it, maybe 500 billion of it. So what we are going to do is, and all of that is being powered by things like cloud computing with these frontier models, open source models, small language models, and so on. And so our capital investment and human capital investment will fit intothat. So the way I think about it is if Microsoft has X revenue inside the country, that means there needs to be 99% more revenue created because of the output of compute. And so that's kind of how we will invest.Q) I want to talk about OpenAI, and of course, your partnership with OpenAI. Sam Altman has said it's one of the greatest tech bromances. But how do you de-risk yourself? I know that you've said you're not interested in what the board seat does for you. But obviously, you do want to ensure that there is stability as far as OpenAI is concerned. How do you de-risk yourself from a commercial perspective? Have you re-negotiated your commercial terms? For instance, do you intend to do that?A) Yeah. I mean, first of all, I've grown up in a company that has always created lots of enterprise value by partnering and partnering well, right? I grew up in a company where Microsoft and Intel brought together the advances that Intel made and what we did with Windows. Same thing with SAP. I built our database business by partnering deeply with SAP. So at some level, this is core to us. And so the latest example of that is what OpenAI and Microsoft have been able to do. So we're very, very comfortable with the partnership, what it has achieved to date. Of course, we want stability in OpenAI.We are very excited about the new board. We have an observer seat. We are not—you know, we were comfortable before and we are comfortable now. And at the end of the day, we want to be good partners where OpenAI can succeed with us and we can succeed with OpenAI. But more importantly, at the end of the day, it's our customers and partners who rely on the two of us, just like how the PC revolution was created by Intel and Microsoft, we hope the OpenAI-Microsoft relationship creates the AI revolution.Q) You said you're waiting for the competition. Where do you believe competition is going to come at you from?A) It's going to come from everywhere. I think that all of our big tech peers have done faster work on all of this. It's fantastic. I mean, therefore, one of the things that I think is understated is competition among big tech players I think is very healthy. When you have all of the folks competing with each other, that means it's creating a real opportunity for the world to benefit. New entrants, always, whenever anyone gets excited aboutsort of the existing incumbents, you have to watch out for new entrants, and OpenAI is a great example. After all, OpenAI wouldn't have existed, but for our support early on, they are a very credible company today and we are excited to be able to sort of really play our part in it.Q) Satya, let me end by asking you a decade now at Microsoft, steering things at Microsoft, and it's a very different company in so many ways - $3 trillion in market cap to just start with. What are you proudest of over the last 10 years of the changes that you have been able to achieve? And more importantly, what do you see as the engines that will drive Microsoft from here on?A) It's a great point, Shereen. The way I count my time is this is my 32nd year at Microsoft and my fourth big platform shift. I was lucky enough to be part of the PC client-server, the Web Internet, mobile cloud, and now AI, and this is year two of AI. If anything, I am going back in time to your point of learning from what was it like when year two of the PC revolution, year two of the browser, year two of, say, the cloud, and ensuring..., and the lesson I learned is you got to take the new tech, lean in completely, democratize it, and have innovation. Because, at the end of the day, there is no franchise value in our business. What matters is, long before conventional wisdom, can you make it to the other side and then really create that platform? And that's what I am excited about."

(PPBL), an associate company of One97, on January 31, saying “persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank” warranted the supervisory action. The RBI did not provide details of the concerns.One97 said its marketing and financial services business is not affected by the RBI’s directions towards PPBL. Its financial services such as loan distribution, insurance distribution and equity broking are not related to PPBL and are expected to be unaffected.According to Ved, the RBI wanted PPBL to operate at arm's length from the service provider and that did not happen. Despite the huge customer base, he said the regulatory issues led to uncertainty, which investors do not want.One97 Communications shares gained 10 percent to Rs 496.75 on the BSE on February 7 after falling almost 50 percent since the RBI imposed restrictions on the fintech company's payments bank business.Strategic buyersVed said Paytm gained popularity after the November 2016 demonetisation as customers and merchants started using its app for online payments. After this, Paytm became the de facto platform for payments, said Ved.""While everyone in the private sector thought there was no money in UPI, Paytm gained a significant market share in UPI,"" said Ved, referring to the Unified Payments Interface, a platform that enables online fund transfers between bank accounts.Ved said Paytm was unique because it had a platform for customers and businesses and could cross-sell services between them.Paytm built a business of significant value and was on the path to profitability, said Ved. Even though the company has quantified the impact of the central bank's restriction, Ved was not sure how much time the company would take to claw back what it lost.Paytm said the regulatory measures are expected to have a worst-case impact of Rs 300-500 crore on its annual operational profit.There could also be strategic buyers for Paytm's payments business, said Ved.""I don't know whether Vijay Shekhar Sharma is willing to sell Paytm Payments Bank or not. There may be buyers. However, we have to see whether the existing founders are willing to sell stake or not. We also have to see whether the merger and acquisition is blessed by the regulator or not,"" he said.The central bank directed Paytm Payments Bank to stop accepting deposits or credit transactions or top-ups in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, and NCMC cards after February 29, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds.

Paytm Payments Bank has also been barred from accepting top-ups in any customer accounts, including prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags and NCMC cards.The RBI said it was taking action against Paytm Payments Bank after the Comprehensive System Audit and compliance validation report of the external auditors revealed ""persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank, warranting further supervisory action"".Amid reports of a possible Enforcement Directorate probe, Revenue Secretary Sanjay Malhotra told Moneycontrol on February 3 that while law enforcement agencies will investigate Paytm if needed, there is no such action afoot at the moment.Paytm has denied any probe into it, its associates, and the company's founder for money laundering activities."

Do not wait until March 31 to complete the process as technical glitches on investment portals could derail your plans at the last minute.","If you have chosen the old, with-exemptions tax regime and have not made your tax-saver investments yet, you have no time to lose. March 31 – the last date to complete the exercise for the financial year 2023-24 – is less than two months away.If you are a salaried employee and have missed the deadline for filing investment declaration set by your employer, you can still make these investments, but there will be a price to pay. In such cases, your employer would have deducted excess tax while computing your taxable income for the financial year 2023-24. While you can claim tax refund on this excess tax deducted when you file your returns in July, it is a hassle best avoided.In fact, all tax-payers would be better off commencing their tax-saving exercise well in advance, preferably in April, right at the beginning of the financial year. An early start can help you avoid last-minute glitches and hurried investment decisions.A proactive approach will ensure that your tax-planning is not an isolated activity, but is integrated into your overall goal-based financial planning strategy.Also read: New tax return forms for FY 2023-24 seek more details of tax deductions to eliminate false claimsTo understand the do’s and don’ts of tax planning – particularly at the last minute – Moneycontrol’s Preeti Kulkarni spoke to Nisreen Mamaji, Founder, MoneyWorks Financial Services. Here are the key takeaways from the discussion:-              It is always better to start tax planning exercise in April – beginning of the financial year – to make the most of tax-saving benefits on offer under sections 80C, 80D (health insurance premiums) and so on.-              This will ensure that you have more time to do your research and choose investment avenues after carefully evaluating them on parameters such as risk-reward, liquidity and lock-in period.-              You can invest systematically through the year if you start in April, ensuring minimal burden on your cashflows. Investing at one go in March could mean constricted cashflows in the last month of the financial year.-              For instance, you can start systematic investment plan (SIP) into equity-linked saving schemes (ELSS) in April instead of investing a lump-sum in February or March. This will help you effectively navigate market volatility during the year.-              However, there’s no need to panic even if you haven’t made any tax-saver investments so far. But first, check the shortfall in the Rs 1.5-lakh limit under section 80C that you need to bridge.-              Take into account your employees provident fund (EPF) contribution, life insurance premiums and children’s tuition fee paid during the year before you make fresh 80C investments.-              Next, you can choose from a host of 80C instruments such as ELSS funds, public provident fund (PPF), national savings certificates (NSC), senior citizen savings scheme (SCSS) if you are senior citizen and so on.-              ELSS funds come with shortest lock-in period of three years. Although the returns are market-linked and hence risk tolerance needed is higher, they can help build wealth and boost your retirement corpus if you stay invested over the long-term.-              Ascertain your short-term and long-term goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon before you commit to long-term products. Such instruments cannot be liquidated should the need arises in times of emergencies.-              Do not wait until March 31 to complete the process as technical glitches on investment portals could derail your plans at the last minute."

We will let you know about the progress once everything is finalised,” Paytm Money said in a blog on February 3.What happenedDespite efforts, Paytm Money users continue to remain stuck in the process of changing bank accounts.“I have set PPBL as my default account for mutual fund SIP auto-debits. Every time I initiate the process of transferring banks, it shows change of default mandate has been temporarily blocked and asks (me) to try later. They keep telling me that they are working on it but it has been almost a week,” two users said.Another account holder said he was unable to change the default bank (PPB) for mutual fund investment even after successfully adding another bank account.Many took to social media to express similar concerns.“I invested in mutual funds through Paytm Money and PPB is a default account. I have tried so many times to change it. The bank will stop working, then what will happen to my money? How can I redeem the fund?,” a user said.Mine is not a merchant account.

I am unable to delete paytm payment bank as default bank at pytm money. I am also unable to set another bank as default. U hv intentionally disabled this @RBI @SEBI_India— Amit Kumar (@amit_css) February 4, 2024A senior expert in the space said changing primary bank accounts is standard practice and should not come with many issues.“A broker must shift the bank account if the modification request is sent by the client with the required proof. They cannot deny it. It could be that their (Paytm Money) backend system is not up to the mark to deal with this or it’s a CDSL issue,” he added.Central Depository Services Ltd, or CDSL, is a central securities depository in India, which helps investors or shareholders to store their shares and other tradable instruments in electronic form.The dividends made by users on shares are disbursed by CDSL and transferred to their primary bank accounts, wherein online brokerages (depository participants) act as a link between the two.Another executive of a brokerage firm explained that the change of bank account is technically updated by the CDSL and online broking companies act as a mere tech platform.“This is Paytm Payments Bank-specific problem. There are some issues with those account transfers from CDSL’s end, and hence this may be taking time,” he added.Some of the users at Groww complained of going through an offline process to change their PPBL accounts, wherein they were asked to send request forms via posts to make a switch.However, brokers said that this has been addressed after some changes in the system.“Customers will now be able to automatically change their demat bank accounts opened in Groww. We are communicating the same to our customers,” the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, Zerodha is said to be undertaking the process smoothly, while refraining from sharing the number of PPB account holders on their system.“There are no issues. Our clients can delink their Paytm accounts and map another. We will also communicate this to clients who have not unmapped it on their own over the next week and link to another bank account,” the spokesperson at Zerodha said.He added that users can make a switch even after the February 29 deadline for receiving credit in PPBL, but they will have to switch the accounts to make a withdrawal.Read the explainer to understand more"

A veteran trader, Jitendra Jain, has been noticing such movements for the past six months and has even given them a name — 'injections'.He started calling them injections because the price movements appear like injections on the candle charts and because they can be painful jabs that wipe out lakhs or even a few crores of rupees in minutes.Also read: Why the VIX is not the best indicator for a savvy traderShreyas Bandi, a well-respected trader, said that people who trade in a few crores — anywhere between Rs 2 crore and Rs 10 crore — have lost 8 to 10 percent of their capital in just a few minutes because of this phenomenon.Market participants say that this is more frequent in the less-liquid options of Sensex and Mid-cap Nifty, though there have been instances in Finnifty as well.A trader shared on X (formerly Twitter) how he was making a profit of Rs 1 lakh when he was headed to the gym and came back to find that his put option had been squared off at 20x his sell price. He had sold a put option at Rs 50, but the market fell more than he had estimated, and the option was squared off (by buying the put option) at Rs 1,000. The trader shared that his entire year’s profit of over Rs 80 lakh was gone in one move.Various people have replied to the tweet with their experiences. One said that he had sold Sensex 72,500 at Rs 44, and it was squared off at more than 10x the price at Rs 441.Why is it happening?The name Jain gave to these price movements has caught on. On X, people have started frequently posting about the “injections” they have received.Jain believes that these surges started happening because of congestion, with too many players trading the same contracts at the same strikes. Therefore, when a stop loss hits, everyone tries to exit at the same time, and the price of the option shoots up to meet the demand.For example, if you have sold Sensex 70,000 PE thinking the index won’t fall that far and it does, then you will need to buy the put option to square off your position. But, since many people are betting on the same price movement, all of them will compete to buy the same put option, and therefore, the price of this contract will shoot up.Bandi compared the phenomenon to a crowded stadium that suddenly sees smoke rising from a corner. “The danger will not come from that possible fire but from the stampede when people are rushing out of a single exit,” he said, to illustrate why the crowding at a strike price can be more dangerous than an event that sets off a panic.Also, people choose market orders over limit orders to ensure that they get an exit. Market orders cause a buy/sell of an option at whatever the market price is at that point, while limit orders are executed only if the price of the security falls within a range.These events have become more probable with the multitudinous contracts that are being sold. Now there is an expiry every day — Monday is the day for Midcap Nifty expiry, Tuesday for Finnifty, Wednesday for Bank Nifty, Thursday for Nifty, and Friday for Sensex — and most people trade on the same instruments on their respective days of expiry.Also read: SEBI's shortening of the settlement cycle will take a toll on the marketThe initial daysJain noticed the phenomenon first on September 7, 2023. It was on Nifty 19,750CE (call option) when the option went up from around Rs 5 to Rs 36 — more than 7x — in just five minutes.Back then, it was happening maybe once a month. But in the last two months, the frequency has gone up to three to four times a month, he said."

We expect the RBI to maintain the status quo on its stance in the February policy. We expect the stance to change to neutral in April,” Sen Gupta told Moneycontrol.On the MPC’s decision on the repo rate, Sen Gupta said that the central bank will maintain the status quo on policy rates in the February policy.She further highlighted that the core inflation is expected to remain contained with some moderation in growth momentum in FY25. Edited excerpts:What will RBI’s MPC decision on repo rate be on February 8?We expect a status quo on policy rates in the February policy. Further, we expect the RBI to start rate cuts from June or August 2024 onwards.Do you see a change in stance of the RBI in the coming MPC meeting?The key focal point for the RBI monetary policy will be whether the stance is retained and the outlook on liquidity management. RBI’s liquidity management indicates a shift in policy preference, from keeping overnight rates closer to MSF, towards keeping it between MSF and repo rate. RBI has been infusing liquidity via VRRs since mid-December to keep overnight rates below MSF. At the same time, it has also undertaken VRRRs to prevent overnight rates from falling below the repo rate.However, it might be too soon to change the stance from a signalling perspective, as inflation remains above the 4 percent target. Therefore, we expect the RBI to maintain the status quo on its stance in the February policy. We expect the stance to change to neutral in April. That said, stance change will be a close call.RBI policy: MPC may leave repo rate unchanged, say bankersIndia's headline retail inflation rate accelerated to a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December. Implication for monetary policy?The rise in inflation to 5.69 percent in December was primarily due to an adverse base effect. More importantly, third quarter FY24 inflation at 5.4 percent was lower than RBI’s estimate of 5.6 percent. MPC members are likely to draw comfort from broad-based moderation in core CPI inflation, spread across goods and services inflation.The coexistence of subdued core inflation and strong growth conditions is likely due to growth being led by a capex cycle while private consumption growth has been softer than expected.In the fourth quarter of FY24, headline CPI inflation is expected to average at 4.8 percent versus RBI’s estimate of 5.2 percent. Food inflation is showing some signs of easing in January 2024, with a winter decline in vegetables.What are your thoughts on the current account deficit?The current account deficit in FY24, is expected to reduce to 1.2 percent of GDP versus a 2 percent deficit in FY23, led by a reduction in the trade deficit as commodity prices eased and supply chains normalised.Services surplus and transfers have risen, reflecting the strong growth of India’s services exports and strong growth conditions in the US. The current account reflects the gap between savings and investments in the economy. The reduction in Current Account Deficit in FY24 indicates that overall gross savings in the economy as percent of GDP has likely risen in FY24.Also, how do you see the current inflation playing out?In FY25, our inflation estimate is tracking at 4.5 percent assuming a normal monsoon and crude oil prices remaining moderate. Core inflation is expected to remain contained with some moderation expected in growth momentum in FY25. Support to listed companies’ profits from reduction in input cost pressures which was significant in FY24, is likely to be incrementally lower in FY25. This is likely to result in softer urban wage growth, impacting urban consumption.Additionally, capex cycle recovery will need support from private capex, as government capital expenditure (centre plus states) moderates.RBI norms on consumer credit: Banks see some impact but remain bullishWhen do you see a cut in repo rate by RBI?The first step would be aligning the weighted average call rates with the repo rate. Over the October 2023 to January 2024 period, the weighted average call rate was closer to MSF, as liquidity conditions tightened. The rise in system liquidity deficit is led by a seasonal pick-up in currency leakage, build-up of government cash surplus and lesser support from Balance of Payments (BoP).The build-up in government cash surplus reflects strong tax collections (liquidity drain) and moderate government expenditure. However, in February 2024, the weighted average call rates moved towards the repo rate, reducing real rates by 25bps.Hence there has been a change in policy preference from keeping overnight rates closer to MSF, to keeping overnight rates between MSF and repo rate. Hence, the first step of moving overnight rates towards the repo rate has begun.The next step will be policy rate cuts which are expected to start from June or August onwards. Growth conditions have held up, which has provided policymakers with the space to focus on aligning inflation with the 4 percent target."

That may not have been exactly what Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, meant when he said the economy appeared to be on a “golden path,” but it was the rosy scenario investors focused on.Economic growth remains robust to start the year, but some recent data and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have made that nirvana-like set of conditions less probable. A couple of key business sentiment measures have raised the possibility that a pickup in production could fuel a pickup in inflation. At the same time, Powell has said that the Fed wants further evidence of a sustainable easing in price pressures before cutting rates.Such reluctance signals a central bank that’s waiting for the year-over-year level of its preferred inflation gauge to return to 2 percent and, in waiting, increasing the risk of an unwelcome economic surprise. That measure has climbed at a 1.9 percent annualized rate, below the Fed’s target, over the past seven months already. With a continued fall in shelter inflation nearly assured (read this) and overall wage growth cooling to pre-pandemic levels, there’s little reason to believe inflation can pick up in a meaningful and sustainable way.Yet recent data has muddied the waters. On business sentiment, the big news last week came from the Institute for Supply Management’s closely followed manufacturing report, which showed new orders expanding again for the first time since August 2022. This has been a long time coming. I first wrote about the possibility in December 2022 — at the time, inventory levels were too high because of all the orders that had poured in in late 2021 and early 2022. While sales remained resilient, companies weren’t yet in a position to place new orders. I thought inventory levels might take until the spring of 2023 to be worked down, but it ended up taking much longer. The report showed prices paid increased as well, though to a level that on its own shouldn’t signify an inflation concern.More worrying on the inflation front was the ISM’s services report, which came out Monday, showing the biggest one-month increase in a decade for its prices-paid component. The data casts some doubt over whether overall inflation will remain at the low levels we’ve witnessed since the middle of last year.Meanwhile, the Fed looks content to wait a little longer to see how things shape up. Powell used two opportunities in the past week to push back on market pricing for an early start to policy easing. Traders have gone from seeing reasonable prospects for a 25-basis-point cut in March and the certainty of a reduction in May to now wagering on an 80 percent chance of a move in May.The risk is that this recovery in factory orders and perhaps quicker inflation is akin to a ""dead cat bounce,"" but the Fed uses the improvement in cyclical economic activity to postpone rate cuts for too long.After a miserable 2023, a modest recovery in factory orders and housing activity makes sense, with or without rate cuts. An uptick in prices for some parts of the goods economy that have been weak, such as trucking freight rates, would make sense, too.But there’s little doubt that monetary policy continues to restrain growth. With financing costs where they are, it seems unlikely that companies will rush to expand capacity or break ground on new apartments. Despite the strong addition to January payrolls, the average workweek showed another concerning drop, suggesting labour market risks remain.Rather than drawing out the timing of the first rate cut, creating anxiety among businesses and consumers needing to borrow or refinance debt, it would be better to start sooner and cut slowly, communicating that there’s no guarantee the easing cycle will be long and deep if the economy shows signs of a meaningful reacceleration. Instead, a potential uptick in cyclical economic activity and inflation after an unsustainable period of weakness threaten to confuse the Fed and keep rates overly restrictive until something breaks. Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

It has indicated that liquidity conditions will ease.“The RBI may dial down the language on liquidity, assure the market through their finetuning operations and like to keep liquidity at destined level,” said V Ramachandra Reddy, head of treasury at Karur Vysya Bank.Sakshi Gupta, economist at HDFC Bank, said liquidity is likely to be kept tight in the near term, although there could be a move away from a large deficit as government spending picks up.The RBI is scheduled to release the monetary policy on February 8. Experts do not expect any major liquidity announcements in the policy and reckon the RBI will continue with finetuning operations.“Government spending is likely to further ease liquidity conditions,” RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said on December 20. “The Reserve Bank will remain nimble in liquidity management.”A Moneycontrol poll on February 5 showed that the majority of bankers and economists expect the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee to leave the key interest rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in this week’s review. All eight experts who participated in the survey said there won’t be any change in the policy rate.Seven said the central bank would maintain the policy stance of withdrawal from accommodation in the meeting, largely continuing the policy approach taken in recent months. One person said the stance could be changed to neutral.RBI monetary policy in February 2024 likely to be staid, but what comes next?Tight liquidityLiquidity in the banking system has remained tight over the past few months. The RBI has provided support with variable rate repo (VRR) auctions whenever there were major outflows from the banking system. Currently, liquidity in the banking system is estimated to be in a deficit of about Rs 1.01 lakh crore.However, the central bank has conducted variable rate reverse repo (VRRR) auctions over the past few days. Experts said this was because of higher funds parked by a few banks in the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) and a fall in overnight rates.On February 7, Moneycontrol reported that the RBI is likely to conduct more VRRR auctions if the funds parked by banks in the SDF remain high. Under the SDF, eligible entities can place deposits with the RBI on an overnight basis.Since the start of this month, funds placed in the SDF by banks daily remained at over Rs 1 lakh crore. As per RBI data, banks parked Rs 1.02 lakh crore on February 2, Rs 95,979 crore on February 3, Rs 1.11 lakh crore on February 4, and Rs 1.25 lakh crore on February 5.“Through various money market operations, the RBI is aiming to keep overnight rates anchored close to the repo rate of 6.50 percent. In effect, this will be a reduction from 6.75 percent, where the rates have been for the past few months,” said Rajeev Pawar, head of treasury at Ujjivan Small Finance Bank.Adding to this, Ajit Banerjee, Chief Investment Officer of Shriram Life Insurance said the RBI will likely continue actively managing short-term liquidity through measures such as VRRs, reaffirming its commitment to liquidity management.Markets eye rate cut cues even as RBI will likely keep repo rate unchangedInflation expectationsThe RBI is likely to be more comfortable on inflation in the February monetary policy meeting, experts said. But there will be caution. Retail inflation has eased to a level within its tolerance range of 2-6 percent in the past few months.However, it remains above the medium-term target of 4 percent. Since inflation is within the RBI’s tolerance band, its focus now is to bring it to 4 percent.India's headline retail inflation rate accelerated to a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on January 12, thanks to an unfavourable base effect."

Most of its holdings are small-cap stocks, which as a category have suffered steep losses lately.Similarly, funds that had previously evaded market declines by focusing on niche plays have also been swept up by the latest strife. The ChinaAMC BJSE Innovative SME Selected 2Y Regular Open Mixed Launched Fund is down more than 15% after surging almost 60% last year. The Soochow Mobile Internet Flexible Allocation Mixed Fund, which bet on semiconductor names, has fallen about 12%.The reversal highlights the difficulties money managers face in China, where even popular trades such as bets on AI names have a short lifespan. Fund closures in the country hit a five-year high last year, and this trend is expected to extend as investor confidence wanes. An index tracking active equity-focused funds is down 16% this year through Tuesday, outpacing the 2.6% drop in the CSI 300.The relentless rout has erased more than $6 trillion from the value of equities in China and Hong Kong from their early 2021 peaks amid an anemic economic recovery and a prolonged property crisis. The CSI 300 Index sank to a five-year last week before seeing a bounce this week amid hopes for authorities to take more forceful steps to sustain a nascent market recovery.Bouts of stock gains spurred by stimulus hopes have only lasted a few days as weak economic data soon poured cold water on optimism. The swoon in Chinese equities is playing out against the backdrop of a rally in global stocks, with the US market trading near a record.That’s led to a record amount of Chinese money flowing into overseas equities as despondent investors seek a way out of the sagging local stock market.Investor Q&AIn an effort to placate investors, Goldstate Capital published a Q&A with the fund manager last month.“We understand how investor confidence has taken a hit amid the extreme loss this year, but it is a case of being oversold,” said portfolio manager Zhou Boyang, according to the company’s official WeChat account. “We are still optimistic on the market for the rest of the year.”Goldstate Capital and the two other asset management firms declined to comment on the losses when contacted by Bloomberg.The meltdown has also wrecked havoc on some hedge funds. A top Chinese macro hedge fund said it slashed stock positions in January as the rout deepened, taking losses after acknowledging mistakes betting on a swift economic recovery. Last month, Singapore-based Asia Genesis Asset Management Pte. said it is closing its macro fund after wrong-way bets on Chinese and Japanese stocks inflicted “unprecedented” losses.“It is indeed hard to invest onshore, and more often than not, it is difficult to make money so funds seek less common trades,” said Jiang Liangqing, managing director at Zhuhai Greenbamboo Private Fund Management. “But the thing with this is that the trend reverses quickly and gains evaporate.”"

Coming quickly on the heels of a fiscally prudent interim Budget, expectations from the upcoming monetary policy have arisen. A change of stance? Measures to provide durable liquidity injection? With a monetary policy pivot in sight (not just in India but globally as well in 2024), such discussions are expected and perhaps will amplify as we move into FY25.But for now, we expect the February 2024 policy to be a non-event (on both stance and rates), for three primary reasons:Comfort on food remains evasiveAfter slipping below 5.0 percent briefly in October 2023, CPI inflation accelerated yet again in the range of 5.6-5.7 percent over November-December 2023. At a granular level, while seasonal correction in food prices quickened in December 2023, it remained lower than historically seen in December. As such, CPI food inflation has remained northwards of 8.0 percent over November-December 2023, ending the calendar year at a 5-month high of 8.7 percent. The still elusive comfort on food inflation and the prospect of non-core price pressures to pass through to core inflation or upend inflation expectations suggests that the RBI almost definitely will be unwilling to lower its guard on inflation any time soon.Fed cuts: The wait got longerBlockbuster additions to non-farm payrolls (373,000 in January 2024) and continued growth in US wages are reinforcing the ‘exceptionalism’ in US growth momentum continuing well into 2024. This has pushed back not just the timing (beyond March 2024) but also the quantum (115 bps versus 150 bps earlier) of rate cut expectations for the imminent rate easing cycle. In our opinion, the RBI would follow and not lead the US Federal Reserve (in terms of timing its first rate cut) in a bid to keep the rate differential intact.Interim Budget, after allAlthough the interim Budget appears non-inflationary and projects the desired macro signal, it was after all interim in nature. The RBI is likely to be cautious and perhaps would like to prefer waiting for the final Budget in June/July 2024 to get the full picture.Having said so, the February 2024 monetary policy will be keenly watched for RBI to reveal its full FY25 GDP growth forecast. With the government pegging nominal GDP growth at 10.5 percent for FY25, wherein the 6.5-7.0 percent range will RBI peg its FY25 growth forecast? (recall, RBI’s Dec-23 Q1-Q3 FY25 GDP projections average at 6.4 percent).Now let us shift focus to the big picture, and look beyond February 24.On growth, clearly, there has been a fair degree of comfort. The higher-than-projected first advance estimate of FY24 GDP growth by NSO, at 7.3 percent completely defies the expectation of moderation in FY24 (versus 7.2 percent in FY23). Growth momentum is anticipated to find support in FY25 from the broad-basing of the investment cycle (to include private sector) and an end of El Nino allowing agriculture/rural demand to recover. Having said so, the slowdown in global growth, moderation in urban demand (both goods and services) and absence of a deflator ‘kicker’ akin to last year (FY24) will mean lower GDP growth in FY25. We peg growth in the range of 6.1-6.3 percent in FY25.CPI inflation trajectory is likely to turn favourable. As per our assessment, inflation could turn out to be marginally below RBI’s estimate of 5.2 percent in Q4 FY24, on account of delayed winters and positive seasonality, along with administrative measures perhaps beginning to have an impact. We had highlighted in the December 2023 inflation assessment that some staples (beyond perishables) within the food basket namely pulses, sugar and spices had shown nascent signs of let up in price pressures. This could perhaps intensify in Q4 FY24, as sales under the ‘Bharat’ brand especially for rice, wheat and pulses galvanise. Further, the expectation of a normal monsoon, as global agencies predict a complete withdrawal of El Nino (ENSO turns neutral) by Apr/May 2024 augurs well for food price pressures, alongside well-behaved crude oil prices despite tensions in the Red Sea region.The comfort on core inflation, which slipped to a cyclical low of 3.9 percent in December 2023, could also remain intact. We project core inflation remaining close to current levels up to Q2 FY25; moving marginally higher thereafter in the range of 4.5-5.0 percent in H2 FY25. Having said so, we will be watchful of the emergence of core inflation pressures on account of an increase in import costs from the Red Sea disturbance (if it were to persist).Overall, we expect inflation to moderate to 4.8 percent (RBI’s estimate of 4.5 percent) in FY25 from 5.3 percent in FY24. This builds on FY24’s achievement of ‘getting back to the target band’, to ‘alignment with the target’ in FY25.What does this mean for the rate cut trajectory in FY25?The strength of growth eliminates any urgency for RBI to soften its stance when inflation is yet to align with the target. This gives RBI a ‘wait window’ to draw clarity on the 2024 Southwest monsoon, the impact of Rea Sea tensions, timing of US Fed actions before it embarks on its rate easing cycle.Remember, market pricing of a pivot can move aggressively, thereby loosening financial conditions rapidly. This could potentially bring forward de facto monetary easing earlier than desired. We have seen the Fed struggle with this aspect of volatility in market pricing, only to provide pushbacks to restore normalcy. RBI should avoid drawing itself into a similar situation.That said, we expect RBI to pivot on stance (turn neutral) in Q2 FY25 (August 2024 policy), setting the stage for embarking on a shallow rate cutting cycle from October 2024, and sniping a cumulative 75 bps in FY25.…And liquidity implicationsThere have been signs of RBI turning mildly hawkish over the last few months, via its liquidity curtailment steps. Despite the net liquidity deficit soaring to a record of Rs 3.3 trillion on January 24, 2024 (though it has eased thereafter possibly owing to a drawdown in government cash balance towards the end of the month), the RBI is unlikely to provide any durable liquidity easing measures as long as monetary policy stance remains in “withdrawal of accommodation” mode. Steps to ease frictional tightness in liquidity would continue to be taken for fine-tuning operations, which does not require the monetary policy platform.As we expect the repo rate to remain unchanged until Q2 FY25, the RBI could signal its ‘steady for longer’ bias by curbing core liquidity surplus to ensure that money market rates trade in the upper band of the LAF corridor. However, this stance could reverse in H2 FY25 (timed to the rate easing cycle) with the RBI deploying easing measures (OMO purchases) to supplement reserve money growth (in the absence of which core liquidity will get extremely restrictive).Yuvika Singhal is Economist at QuantEco Research.

He further told the court that an application to refer the dispute to arbitration is not maintainable in insolvency proceedings.However, senior advocate Pramod Nair, who appeared for Byju's, urged the tribunal to hear both the parties at length and then pass an order. The NCLT thus deferred the hearing of the case to February 28.Arbitration is a mechanism to resolve disputes between parties without going to court, wherein a neutral person (an arbitrator) is appointed to adjudicate the dispute, and the judgment is legally enforceable. For parties to resolve their dispute through arbitration, they must necessarily have an agreement expressing their intention to arbitrate.CasefileThe case, which was filed by the BCCI on September 8, 2023, came up for a hearing only on November 28 last year. At the very first hearing, the NCLT issued notice to Byju’s and sought its response.According to the order from November 2023, the BCCI claimed that Byju’s had defaulted on a payment of Rs 158 crore. “It is stated that the general notice was issued to Byju’s vide email dated 06.01.2023 and the default amount of Rs 158 crore, excluding TDS as reflected,” the NCLT order read.Other insolvency pleas:The NCLT has issued notice to Byju's in a total of three insolvency pleas till February 7. The first one is in response to the plea moved by the BCCI, and the other two related to the pleas moved by erstwhile vendors of the company.On February 6, the NCLT issued a notice in an insolvency plea filed by a digital marketing firm called Surfer Technologies against ed-tech giant Byju's. Surfer argued that Byju's owes them Rs. 2.3 crore and all of them are admitted debts. According to Surfer, they were generating leads for Byju's and passing them on; these leads were overseen and then authorised by the ed-tech company.On February 7, the NCLT issued notice to Byju's for the third time, in a plea filed by France-based Teleperfomance Business Services.

OCs are those who provide goods and services to a business but have not been paid. FCs are those who lend money to the company. Teleperformance is likely to be classified as an OC.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has also filed a separate insolvency plea claiming that Byju’s had defaulted on payment of Rs 158 crore."

The NMC has sought comments from all the stakeholders on the implementation and preparation of conducting the National Exit Test (NExT) by filling up the feedback form by February 7.The stakeholders have also been requested to go-through the NMC National Exit Test Regulations, 2023. The doctors' body said bringing in the NExT defeats the vision of the prime minister and government of affordable and accessible medical education by seriously hampering the survival of medical institutions in underprivileged communities.""We cannot afford to train doctors and deny degree to practise,"" it said. The association further pointed out that currently, uniform standards of medical education across all academic institutions do not exist and testing the entire country with one test would not be feasible.""Using the same exam to test the basic minimum required for licensing and highest standards required for post-graduate entrance assessment is completely illogical,"" it said. The IMA further stressed that the NExT cannot be conducted both as a licentiate exam and a PG entrance exam, as the focus of the licensing exam should be on assessing the minimum standard while that of the PG exam should be to select the most meritorious students.The suggested format of an MCQ-based test will only decrease the attention and interest of students in classes and clinics and help in the mushrooming of coaching centres that are already threatening the medical education system in the country by patronising only the rich and affordable classes, it pointed out. This will also seriously hamper the academic and clinical skills of the students, it stated.As and when the NExT gets planned, the IMA asked for extensive discussions with it and other stakeholders. It further stated that the establishment of a passing criteria that strike a balance between accessibility and the preservation of academic rigour needs to be considered.The initiation of comprehensive stakeholder consultations, followed by a trial period to address potential concerns and the adoption of an assessment methodology that ensures equitable evaluation accommodating the diverse demographics of the student body should be dome, the IMA added. Any change in the medical exam system has to be from a fresh batch after proper notification and making them understand the pattern clearly, it highlighted.""The implementation of NExT without proper evaluation of its potential benefits, limitations and impact on medical education is gross injustice to medical students because even after completing the course, they would be deprived of their right to practise medicine. ""Adequate technical infrastructure, faculty training and support are required in all medical institutions across the country. Limited access to resources may hinder the equal distribution and adoption of NExT across all medical colleges. In light of these stipulations, we assert that NExT should not proceed until these prerequisites are duly satisfied,"" the IMA stated."

The amount of investment planned and the approval from the regulatory authority has not been previously reported.A spokesperson for ADIA declined comment. An email to the International Financial Services Authority (IFSCA), which regulates financial services in the hub, was not answered.With the approval, ADIA will become the first sovereign wealth fund to begin investing in India via GIFT City. The greenlight comes days before Modi is set to visit Abu Dhabi to inaugurate a large temple.Since becoming prime minister a decade ago, Modi has visited UAE six times, strengthening ties with India's third-largest trading partner.Trade between India and the UAE totalled $85 billion for the financial year ending March 2023, according to Indian government data.The Arab nation is host to one of the largest Indian diaspora populations in the world at 3.5 million, which constitute almost 35% of UAEs total population.""By the middle of this year, ADIA could start investing through this fund. The allocated funds would be invested in India over a period of time,"" said the first of the two sources, without elaborating.Funds which set up at GIFT City can invest in Indian and foreign equities and debt securities, among other assets.Modi's government has in recent months tried to boost activity at the GIFT City, including by allowing firms which are unlisted in India to list shares directly at exchanges there.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharam, while announcing the federal budget this month, said the government aims to build up GIFT City as a ""gateway for global capital and financial services for the economy.The zone offers a 10-year tax holiday for companies setting up there, no taxes on the transfer of funds from overseas jurisdictions and closeness to Indian markets.ADIA and its wholly-owned subsidiaries has specifically been exempt from long-term capital gains taxes from Indian investments via a special provision introduced in 2020 and applicable till March 2025.Fund management activities via the hub have picked up after a slow start. As December 2023, it had 95 local and global funds with commitments of $30 billion and investments of over $2.93 billion.""IFSCA is in early stages of discussions with other sovereign wealth funds to set up operations in GIFT City,"" said the second of the two sources cited earlier in the story."

IEX Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) Satyanarayan Goel said initial simulations of market coupling by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) did not show any significant benefits.""IEX welcomes directions by the CERC regarding the shadow pilot study on market coupling. After examining the stakeholders' suggestion on the CERC staff paper on market coupling dated August 21, 2023, the Commission carried out simulations for coupling in the day-ahead market (DAM) and real-time market (RTM), and no significant benefit was observed,"" Goel told Moneycontrol.Of all the electricity that is traded in the Indian power exchanges, IEX has a share of about 90 percent. Power exchanges offer different products such as DAM, RTM, term-ahead market, green-dam and so on. DAM and RTM contribute 75-80 percent of the country's total exchange volumes, of which IEX holds nearly 100 percent market share.MC Explains | What is market coupling and why is it in the news?Market coupling, once implemented, is likely to reduce the dominance of IEX in terms of market share. IEX has been against market coupling saying the interpretation of the system can kill innovation and competition in the sector.Goel said one of the suggestions received was for coupling RTM with Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and simulation studies of this indicated marginal benefit under this alternative.The CERC order, seen by Moneycontrol, however, also stated that coupling RTM and SCED would help increase the depth of the market while ensuring system reliability. ""Based on the simulation results presented by the staff, the Commission is of the view that the proposed coupling of RTM with SCED may enable harnessing of the unutilised generation, serving the unmet demand and resulting in significant cost optimisation,"" read the order.IEX says market coupling will kill innovation, move akin to clubbing Ola, UberGoel said, ""For a detailed analysis CERC has now directed Grid-India to carry out simulations in the next six months for different alternatives considering operational, market and regulatory aspects of the implementation.""He added that the CERC order is only for a pilot study and a final view will be taken based on the outcome of the study and consultation with stakeholders thereafter.IEX shares fell 5 percent intraday on February 7, a day after the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) ordered for a shadow pilot on the market coupling of India's power exchanges. At 2:35 pm, the stock was trading at Rs 145.15.Satyajit Ganguly, MD & CEO of Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL), said market coupling will facilitate in creation of an integrated and efficient electricity market that supports the growth of multiple power exchanges and enlarges their role as ‘Market Infrastructure Institution’.“It would lead to a level playing field for all power exchanges in DAM & RTM. PXIL welcomes CERC’s move, which will result in an innovative and healthy competition environment in the Indian power market,” he said.Ganguly added that the mechanism of market coupling will integrate the bids of market participants, who may choose to participate in multiple exchanges. “This will allow them to avail benefits of multi-power exchange model but with the discovery of single common price based on merged bids of the combined market,” he said.The other power exchange, Hindustan Power Exchange Limited (HPX), did not respond to Moneycontrol's query at the time of filing this report."

'MECON, Ranchi, Uttaranchal', was hired as a consultant for the installation of a pollution control plant.","The CBI has registered an FIR against the managing director of Kerala government PSU Travancore Titanium Products Limited (TTPL) and others in connection with its losses of Rs 120 crore due to alleged irregularities in the hiring of 'MECON, Ranchi, Uttaranchal' as a consultant in 2004.The FIR registered recently also names TTPL former managing director Eapen Joseph. 'MECON, Ranchi, Uttaranchal', was hired as a consultant for the installation of a pollution control plant.The CBI alleged that Joseph abused his official position and committed criminal misconduct to enter into a criminal conspiracy with then officials — chief manager (marketing) Santosh Kumar and executive director A M Bhaskaran. They allegedly appointed 'MECON, Ranchi, Uttaranchal', a PSU under the steel ministry, as a consultant at a charge of Rs 9 crore instead of the agreed Rs 3.5 crore, the FIR, registered on the directions of the Kerala High Court, said.The FIR lists the MD of TTPL as accused number one but does not give the name. TTPL manufactures titanium dioxide pigment widely used in tablet and pellet coatings. The process generates large quantities of liquid effluent containing ferrous sulphate and sulphuric acid, discharged into the Arabian Sea.In 2003-04, the TTPL engaged 'Metallurgical and Engineering Consultants (India) Limited (MECON), Ranchi, Uttaranchal' to address the problem. MECON had to prepare a basic project implementation document (BPID), an environmental impact assessment (EIA) report and an environmental management plan (EMP) as well as carry out engineering project management and implementation. Officials said the estimated cost of the project proposed by MECON was Rs 129 crore for the first phase and Rs 126 crore for the second phase. The project cost was more than twice the value of the total assets of TTPL, the Kerala High Court had noted in its November 2023 order.""More than Rs.120 Crores had already been spent by the Titanium Company (TTPL) for the pollution control projects proposed by MECON. But the plants could not be commissioned. In the meantime, MECON intimated to the Titanium Company in June 2007 that the project's total cost for Phase I and II escalated to Rs.414 Crores (Rs.225.8 Crores for Phase I and Rs.188.6 for Phase II). ""The additional amount required to complete the pollution control project, part of Phase I, was about Rs.160 Crores. The Titanium Company was unable to incur such a huge additional financial burden,"" the court noted.It said the project conceived and implemented through MECON caused a loss of Rs 120 crore to without any corresponding benefit. ""The selection of MECON as a Project Management Consultant, the implementation of its recommendation without proper assessment of financial viability and technical feasibility and the placement of orders through MECON was part of a criminal conspiracy hatched at the highest level of administration in the State Government and by the officials of the Titanium Company and MECON,"" it said.In its FIR, the CBI alleged MECON placed work orders for a Finland-based company Chematur Ecoplanning for Rs 258 crore without inviting a global tender. This violated the provisions of the Supreme Court Monitoring Committee without Union Environment and Forest Ministry's sanction and violating Hazardous Waste Rules 1989. Chematur was paid Rs 20 crore as an advance without obtaining a performance guarantee. Joseph and Bhaskaran received an undue pecuniary advantage for themselves and those who favour them, the agency alleged.In an alleged criminal conspiracy, Joseph facilitated former chief commercial managers, TTPL Thomas Mathew and B. Gopakumaran Nair, to set up a namesake firm to ""plunder the TTPL funds"", in which they made themselves consultants and took consultancy charges, it said."

Collectively, the CEO and other members of the group management committee took a 21 per cent reduction in their variable pay, Channel News Asia reported.""The Board determined that the variable compensation for the CEO and other members of the Group Management Committee should be cut to hold them accountable for the series of digital disruptions during the year (2023),"" DBS said. Singapore's largest lender suffered a series of disruptions to its digital banking services last year, culminating in the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) barring DBS from any acquisitions of new business ventures for six months.DBS was also made to pause non-essential IT changes for six months and was not allowed to reduce the size of its branch and ATM networks in Singapore. Gupta said on Wednesday that the bank's senior management team has shown that it is taking responsibility for the series of service disruptions last year.We announced that we're taking accountability at the senior management, starting with me, but also the rest of my senior management team. I think that's a good element of governance,"" Gupta said. If you can establish accountability and figure that people take responsibility for making fixes, that's a good place to start. We've been able to demonstrate that and that's obviously despite a record profit year, he told reporters.The bank maintains guidance for net interest income for 2024 at around last year's levels after posting a 2 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net profit, beating expectations. ""While interest rates are expected to soften and geopolitical tensions persist, our franchise strengths will put us in good stead to sustain our performance in the coming year,"" Gupta said in a statement.Besides maintaining net interest income at around 2023 levels, he expected return on equity (ROE) to be 15 per cent to 17 per cent for this year and fee income growth at double-digit, according to slides accompanying his results. Singapore's banks, the largest in Southeast Asia, are set to post higher profits for the fourth quarter because of higher interest rates, though growth momentum is poised to slow as central banks pivot toward rate cuts and volatile markets weigh on the wealth business.DBS, the first Singapore lender to report this earnings season, said October-December net profit grew to 2.39 billion Singaporean dollars (USD1.78 billion) from 2.34 billion Singaporean dollars a year earlier on the back of a 9 per cent increase in total income. DBS, which is also Southeast Asia's biggest bank, proposed a final dividend of 54 cents per share and 1-for-10 bonus issue.Full-year annual profit jumped 26 per cent to Singaporean dollars 10.3 billion from Singaporean dollars 8.19 billion in 2022. Return on equity climbed to a record high of 18 per cent from 15 per cent a year ago."

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. After thorough deliberation, the Board of the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) has approved an extension in trading hours for index futures. Previously, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had spoken about varying opinions within the broking community, indicating ongoing discussions. Buch had remarked, “It's a divided house, and we have yet to gather input from investors.”The National Stock Exchange (NSE) submitted a proposal to SEBI last year, requesting an extension of trading hours for index futures from 6 pm to 9 pm. However, this was met with scepticism from smaller, traditional brokers, who anticipated additional resource allocation for an evening trading desk if market timings were changed.Recent information from ANMI suggests that smaller brokers have consented to the proposed alterations. According to the NSE proposal, there would be evening sessions between 6 pm and 9 pm initially, alongside regular trading hours. In a subsequent phase, index derivatives trading might extend until 11:30 pm.Concerns weren't limited to smaller brokers; some other market participants too expressed apprehension, citing potential impacts on work-life balance due to extended trading hours.However, it's important to recognise that an open exchange does not mandate trading activity. Many major exchanges worldwide operate for extended periods. Additionally, extending NSE trading hours should be manageable if smaller brokers are able to currently manage commodities trading until midnight without issue.One needs to understand the need for extended hours in a world where the market is impacted by news from anywhere in the world. One reason is that we have seen volatility increase and post-market developments see the market open with huge gaps over the past few years because markets have become more connected. While there is some overlap between domestic and European market timings, our markets are closed when the US is open.Wars, financial crises, central bank announcements, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters are all affecting markets more severely than they used to be earlier. Part of the panic reaction could be the increased participation of retail traders globally.Extended hours allow traders to hedge their portfolios in derivative markets, mitigating potential losses. While only index futures are traded during these hours, that provides a means to safeguard positions amid market fluctuations.Despite extended trading, the bulk of trading activity in such markets occurs during regular working hours only. Extended hours primarily serve to address international developments, offering traders a chance to react to global events and potentially reduce market gaps.Currently, international traders enjoy round-the-clock trading via GIFT Nifty, granting them an advantage over Indian traders.

129,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mc-explains-what-is-market-coupling-and-why-is-it-in-the-news-12210701.html,MC Explains: What is market coupling and why is it in the news?,"February 07, 2024 02:49 PM IST","It would mean a uniform price for electricity across power bourses, but analysts say this will not have any immediate impact on the end user (household, industry or commercial).","The term “market coupling” is back in vogue with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issuing a suo motu order directing Grid Controller of India Limited (Grid-India) to implement it in India's power exchanges on a shadow pilot basis.The development resulted in the shares of Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), a bourse for electricity trade, crashing by 23 percent in just two days, with the IEX stock falling 4.8 percent intraday on February 7 to trade at Rs 145.45 intraday and at 11.07am.Moneycontrol gives you a lowdown on this development.What is market coupling?India has three power exchanges—IEX, Power Exchange India Limited (PXIL) and Hindustan Power Exchange Limited (HPX). These are voluntary markets and each of them collect buy and sell bids on their own and, thus, come up with their own market clearing prices (MCPs). In simple terms, currently, each power exchange has a different cost of electricity, even though it usually differs from each other only by a few paisa.Aldo read: One Nation, One Grid, One Price | India plans market coupling in power tradeMarket coupling is a model where buy bids and sell bids from all power exchanges in the country will be aggregated and matched to discover a uniform MCP. It means there will be only one price for the electricity that is to be traded at any point of time through these exchanges. If implemented, power exchanges will be rendered as a platform where only buy and sell bids will be received and power dispatched to the buyer.Why is it in the news now?As per the CERC’s February 6 order, Grid-India will develop the necessary software for running the shadow pilot within two months. The shadow pilot is then to be implemented for four months. It also directed India's three power exchanges to share necessary data and other information required by Grid-India for running the shadow pilot.In August, 2023, the CERC floated a staff paper on market coupling and sought comments from stakeholders on it by September 30. This came after the Union Ministry of Power, on June 2, asked the CERC to initiate the process of market coupling across the country's power exchanges.Is market coupling going to be implemented immediately?No. The CERC in its order has made it clear that results of the shadow pilot run should not have any effect on the price and volume discovery in the actual real-time market (RTM) and day-ahead market (DAM) of the bourses. It also stated that the trial run will not impact the final schedule and settlement for any entity during the trial period.""Based on the insights gained while running the shadow pilot, the Commission shall further decide upon the need for creating the necessary regulatory framework for market coupling,"" the CERC said in its order.The process will also entail a lot of technology upgrades and bringing in new systems, which will take time.Will it impact the end consumer?Market coupling, upon its implementation, is not going to have any immediate impact on the end consumer of electricity (household, industry or commercial). However, in the long run, power ministry officials and a section of stakeholders say it will lead to an overall reduction in power tariffs.Why does the government want market coupling?Apart from the point of uniform price discovery across exchanges mentioned above, the government wants market coupling also because it wants to significantly increase the share of power exchanges in the trade of electricity. The government wants to reduce prevalence of the current format of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs), which run for as long as 25 years.It will also help improve the overall allocation of transmission corridors among the power exchanges. At present, usage of transmission corridors is not optimal due to the skewed market share of various power exchanges.Also read: Market Coupling | IEX may lose market share, power sector likely to gainBesides, government officials said it is also required for efficient integration of renewable energy, which is going to constitute 500 GW in India's installed capacity by 2030.Also, to shift to a market-based electricity trading system, the government needs to implement the market-based economic dispatch (MBED) mechanism in India, which is not possible without market coupling. MBED envisages a centralised scheduling for dispatching electricity across the country at the interstate as well as intrastate level. At present, electricity dispatch happens at multiple levels—state as well as central—for which modes of trade are also multiple PPAs, exchanges and power banking.Currently, power exchanges account for only 7 percent of India's electricity trade and the rest is mostly through long-term PPAs which restrict fluidity and liquidity in the sector. For example, if a generating company (genco) has a higher price of power, the distribution company will still have to procure electricity from it due to the PPA signed with it, despite other gencos offering lower power prices.If MBED is implemented, it will render flexibility to both buyers and sellers. This is how, through MBED, power tariffs also will come down in the long run.Why did IEX shares tumble?Of all the electricity that is traded in the Indian power exchanges, IEX has a share of about 90 percent. Power exchanges offer different products such as DAM, RTM, term-ahead market, green-dam and so on. DAM and RTM contribute 75-80 percent of the country's total exchange volumes, of which IEX holds nearly 100 percent market share.Market coupling, once implemented, is likely to reduce the dominance of IEX in terms of market share, which was the primary reason for its share prices to hit Rs 145.15 at 2:35 PM on February 7, down 5.04 percent.Who aggregates and discovers the price in market coupling?There are two ways market coupling can work. One, where an external agency termed the market coupling operator (MCO) will collect the bids and discover the MCP, while also being the custodians of registrations, deposits, payment securities, settlement of financial dues and so on. In India’s case, it could be Grid-India, if the MCO model is used.The second option is a roster system, where the power exchanges take turns in aggregating the bids and discovering the uniform MCP."

There is no immediate proposal to ban exports of parboiled rice, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are confidential. The tax is currently due to expire March 31.Any such move could add to the rally in benchmark Asian rice prices, which are hovering near a 15-year high after India began restricting sales of key varieties in 2023. That would be bad news for some countries in West Africa and the Middle East that rely on the South Asian nation for most of their requirements of the food staple.A spokesperson representing both the food and commerce ministries didn’t immediately comment.An extension of the levy would be a part of the government’s aggressive measures to control food inflation that climbed to almost 10% in December from a year earlier. India has already curbed exports of wheat, sugar and most rice varieties, and cracked down on hoarding. It has also extended low edible oil import duties for another year.Still, retail prices of rice in Delhi remain about 11% higher than a year ago. Food Minister Piyush Goyal launched a program Tuesday to provide subsidized rice to retail customers across the country. The government is already selling wheat flour and chickpeas at cheaper-than-market rates.Parboiled rice, which accounted for about 30% of India’s total exports before the curbs, is the result of a process that involves partial boiling of paddy before milling to boost its nutritional values and change the texture of cooked rice. The South Asian nation had a share of about 40% in the global rice trade in 2022-23."

Will the stance change?,"February 07, 2024 02:32 PM IST","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-led Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is likely to leave key interest rates unchanged in this week’s monetary policy review. All eight experts who participated in the Moneycontrol survey said that there won’t be any change in policy rates. Seven of them highlighted that the central bank would maintain the policy stance of withdrawal from accommodation in the meeting, thus largely continuing the policy approach taken in recent months. One person said the stance could be changed to neutral. If the MPC maintains status quo on February 8, this will be the sixth consecutive pause in the last one year. Since the April monetary policy in 2023, the RBI has kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5%, after raising it by 250 bps since May 2022. What should we expect from the RBI this time around and will the focus be more on liquidity management rather than rates?

The company hopes to gain market share in the category because consumers will prefer to buy a safer Godrej product over that of some unorganised player.","The stocks of Godrej Consumer Products Limited (GCPL) surged over 9 percent on February 1 after the company launched its Goodknight Agarbatti, India’s first, legal anti-mosquito incense sticks.The anti-mosquito incense sticks business is currently a Rs 1,200 crore market that’s crowded by unorganised players. These players bypass the regulations of the Central Insecticides Board (CIB) to create effective yet harmful products.GCPL plans to gain over 50 percent market share from the unorganised players. The Godrej incense stick is using a new molecule – Renofluthrin (RNF) — and GCPL has tied up with a manufacturer that will develop it for the company. RNF is considered twice as effective as other molecules used in home insecticides (HI) in India, says GCPL.Also read Cycle of local players entering market almost over, says HUL's Rohit JawaAnalysts said that the GCPL’s exclusive rights over RNF, along with a strong distribution system, will help the company gain market share in the anti-mosquito incense sticks category.“The new product has an extensive distribution network, which will enable it to make inroads into every nook and corner of the country, and its high-decibel advertising campaign will highlight its safety and efficacy compared to the unorganised trade,” said Vishal Gutka, Research Analyst, Phillip Capital.GCPL will be able to gain market share in the category because consumers will prefer to buy a safer GCPL product over that of some unorganised player, said Ajay Thakur, consumer staples analyst at Anand Rathi. ``Plus, Goodknight Agarbatti is available at a price point that’s similar to the competition’s: Rs 12 in north India, and Rs 10 in south India, enabling consumers to go for the safer product,’’ said Thakur.Home insecticides is a regulated market where companies have to have their formulation, or molecule, approved by the CIB before marketing their product. GCPL has registered RNF with the CIB and can use it in incense sticks.Companies spend several years formulating and testing a new molecule, before they can get the CIB’s approval. “Since unorganised sector players do not take the board’s approval, they dip the sticks in pesticides to make them more effective, which is very harmful,” said an analyst on condition of anonymity.This is not GCPL’s first try at anti-mosquito incense sticks. The company, in 2018, had forayed into this segment with agarbattis made of natural ingredients. However, that was a dud as natural ingredients like neem were ineffective against mosquitoes, said Thakur. The product was slowly phased out.Even though GCPL has a first-mover advantage in incense sticks, it won’t have much of a margin since the product is priced quite low, said analysts Moneycontrol spoke to. “GCPL will gain market share in the incense stick segment, however their margins in this will be lower than the company average,” said Gutka.GCPL can use RNF only in incense sticks now and awaits approval for high-margin products like liquid vaporisers and aerosol. GCPL has exclusive use of RNF medium term, after which the competition can also use the molecule, said Nitin Gupta, Senior Research Analyst, Emkay Financial Services. “From margin perspective, format approvals for liquid vaporiser and aerosol would be crucial,” said Gupta.Medium term is expected to be around 3-4 years say analysts.In an earlier report, Phillip Capital had said, “India continues to work with old molecules, which hampers the effectiveness of HI products, as mosquitoes keep evolving.” It added that the average weight of mosquitoes has more than doubled in the past couple of decades, making products with older molecules less effective. Thus, GCPL has a competitive edge over its competitors in the medium-term at least.The HI category contributes around 30-40 percent of GCPL's revenues. The company's sales have grown at a CAGR of 10 percent over the last three years, while its profit has grown at a CAGR of only 3 percent over the same period. GCPL's share price has increased 29 percent in the last one year, and 17 percent in the last six months.GCPL is expected to report a revenue of Rs 15,749 crore over FY24-25, as per ICICI Securities. It is expected to report a net profit of Rs 2,513 crore over the same period.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

States such as Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Assam are keen on implementing the UCC.Efforts are on to speed up the process to bring about the legislation on common code ahead of the Lok Sabha elections is believed to have major electoral ramifications for the ruling BJP as it was one of the key promises the party had made in the last general elections.The BJP had said in its 2014 and 2019 manifestoes that it will implement the UCC in order to empower women, thereby adhering to the principle of gender justice.The UCC is contemplated as a single law to govern the personal aspects of all citizens of the state such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and adoption.Let's look at the states that are set to toe the Uttarakhand line on UCC...Madhya PradeshSpeaking to the media earlier this month, Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said that his government will implement the UCC. He stressed that he will follow what the Centre will say. “Madhya Pradesh follows the rule of the land,” he added. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said a committee will be formed in MP to look into the issue.AssamSpeaking at various public forums, Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma expressed that Assam will be the third state, after Uttarakhand and Gujarat, to implement the UCC.He highlighted that the Assam UCC will not be applicable to the tribal communities, but it will have “innovative points” against child marriage and polygamy. He stressed the need to end polygamy, for which, his government is planning to bring a Bill in the Budget Session of the Assembly, which began on February 5 and conclude on February 28. The state budget for the next fiscal will be presented on February 12.GujaratAhead of the Assembly polls, Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi had in October 2022 announced that the state will form a committee to implement the UCC. He also stressed that the decision was made in accordance with Article 44 of Part 4 of the Constitution to apply a common law for all citizens.Minister Parshottam Rupala had asserted that the proposed UCC will not violate any fundamental rights, and will cover the Hindu Marriage Act and Muslim personal laws.RajasthanRajasthan has given enough indications that the bill is under consideration. While congratulating the Uttarakhand chief minster, state minister Kanhaiya Lal Choudhary said: “We are making an effort to ensure that Rajasthan becomes the second state after Uttarakhand. The CM is in support of this. He has given directions for this, and work will be done soon. This will be discussed in the current session and if the time is insufficient, it will be brought in the next session.""Let's take a look at the key features of Uttarkhand UCC...- The age of girls for marriage to be increased to 21 years from 18 years.- The hill state’s small tribal community is exempted from the proposed law, which also mandates registration of live-in relationships.- Children born of live-in relationships will be considered legitimate and deserted women will be entitled to maintenance from their partners.- The UCC draft mentions discontinuing the practice of ‘halal’ and ‘iddat’ – terms commonly used while settling marriage disputes among Muslims.- The UCC bans the practice of ‘polygamy’ under Muslim personal law."

Blue Ocean means a new, uncontested market.","The top 30 per cent of rural households in India will show an annual spend of approximately USD 540 billion by 2030, says Anand Daniel, partner at global VC fund Accel, about the increasingly aspirational segment that accounts for 52 per cent of rural consumption.""There is a Blue Ocean opportunity for startups building for rural Bharat's top 30 per cent - there is immense potential for growth and innovation in this segment, which has yet to be fully explored,"" Daniel told PTI, citing the massive runway for business models with a ""Bharat"" focus. Blue Ocean means a new, uncontested market.Internet penetration in rural India, which is getting modernised in terms of both digital and physical infrastructure, reaches 350 million users and 82 per cent of villages, he noted.Accel, an early investor in Flipkart, Freshworks and Swiggy, is excited about areas such as commerce and healthcare for the sector, Daniel said, adding that education and entertainment are the other two sectors that seem very promising.Excerpts from the interview: Q: What makes you bullish on the Bharat opportunity? A: While there is talk of a slowdown in rural India as evidenced by slower volume growth in FMCG, increased demand for work under MGNREGA and weak two-wheeler sales, these data points don't show us what's happening with the top 30 per cent of rural households.By 2030, the top 30 per cent of households will show an annual spend of approximately USD 540 billion. We know that rural India overall is a large consumer market with about USD 500 billion of annual consumption expenditure from over 915 million people.This is two-thirds of India's population. Interestingly, this rural spend is highly concentrated, with 52 per cent rural consumption coming from the top 30 per cent households. Till now, we have seen the success stories of the Indian startup ecosystem or category leaders largely built on catering to the needs of the urban Indian consumer.Given the surface area of the rural Bharat opportunity, we are optimistic that the next wave of disruption will come from daring builders catering to the needs of that top 30 per cent which is an increasingly aspirational rural India.Large public companies across sectors such as FMCG, auto, and fintech are already catering to some needs of rural India and capitalising on this opportunity.There are 10 large public companies making nearly 49 per cent (USD 35 billion-plus) revenue from rural, and each of them adopted a rural-first business model to cater to this segment.We are now seeing the emergence of startups with Bharat-focused business models. More than 50 such startups that are building for Bharat had raised USD 6.7 billion in funding by early 2023.Q: Are there specific sectors that are more promising? Where will we see faster growth in the next three-five years?A: Category wise, rural and urban consumers spend on similar things. However, while urban top 30 per cent spend twice as much on non-food segments (69 per cent) as food, the rural top 30 per cent of consumers spend equal amounts across food and non-food segments.This is pretty eye-opening - in the top 30 per cent rural households, 12 categories (five food, seven non-food) have an annual spend of USD 10 billion plus each, showing us many investable opportunities.Currently, we are excited about areas like commerce and healthcare for Bharat. Education and entertainment are the other two that seem very promising.In commerce, we are observing different models emerge -- kirana-led commerce, village-level entrepreneur-led commerce, rural house of brands -- across sub-categories such as fresh fruit and vegetables, grocery, lifestyle products, beauty and personal care and electronics.We have already invested in two grocery business models for T2/T3 cities and towns with Apnamart and Citymall, and are now looking for similar solutions in rural areas as well. In healthcare, we are seeing solutions being built around remote clinics, digitisation of pharmacies, generic medicines and secondary and tertiary care.There are several reasons for this trend playing out now. First, rural India is getting modernised in terms of both digital and physical infrastructure-internet penetration is high, reaching 350 million users, and 82 per cent of villages are now reachable by road.Second, rural consumers are getting exposed to urban brands and products via online content consumption through social media and Over the Top (OTT) platforms, which indicates that e-commerce adoption in rural India is expected to follow the e-commerce boom in tier-3 cities.Q: What are some of the key challenges that founders can face when building for rural India? A: Building for rural consumers can be tricky - consumers are widespread geographically,which means that population density is low, plus the average revenue one can earn per rural customer will be lower than that of an urban customer.So, founders need to solve for aspects like distribution costs and cost-effective customer acquisition.When it comes to distribution costs, supply chain optimisation should be an area of focus for founders while maintaining viable unit economics. With regard to cost-effective customer acquisition, founders need to have a very sharp focus on selecting their customer and high-value economic clusters (a top 30 percentile rural consumer spend similar to an average urban consumer that is nearly USD 1,000 annual per capita expenditure).There also tends to be a lack of in-depth understanding of the rural consumer. This is a high-trust community that is aspirational and time-rich. Founders need to stay customer-obsessed, and learn the nuances of this audience to fully grasp the painpoints of this target group. There is a Blue Ocean opportunity for startups building for rural Bharat's top 30 per cent -- there is immense potential for growth and innovation in this segment, which has yet to be fully explored.Q: What's your investment approach/philosophy? How has it changed over the past decade in India?A: On average, a bulk of our portfolio returns come from just a handful of investments. This is essentially the ""power law"" at work in the venture capital industry. So our investment approach is to find these outlier companies and back them as early in their journey as possible.A few such outlier examples from Accel's portfolio in India would be Flipkart, Freshworks andSwiggy - all of these were our early-stage bets.We believe in Accel's ""prepared mind"" approach to investing- this is a thesis-based method of investing wherein you research a space and know what large problem needs to be solved and then look for the best team building a solution for that problem."

Non-veg thali cheaper in January, veg thali costlier","February 07, 2024 01:57 PM IST",Here is what is driving the price of a home-cooked vegetarian thali up and making the non-veg thali cheaper,"The price of a home-cooked non-veg thali came down in January, while that of the vegetarian thali went up from the year-ago period, CRISIL-MI&A Research has shown.From Rs 59.9 in January 2023, the price of home-prepared non-veg thali declined to Rs 52. A veg thali, which cost around Rs 26.6 last year, climbed to Rs 28 this January.A near 26 percent decline on-year in poultry prices drove the cost down for the non-veg thali. Higher cost of pulses, rice, onion and tomato pushed the price up for the vegetarian meal.Onion prices in January surged 35 percent on-year, while tomato was up 20 percent, the research showed. Rice and pulses were up 14 percent and 21 percent respectively.Both non-veg and veg thali prices declined on-month due to a fall in onion, tomato and broiler prices. The decline was, hwoever, sharper in case of a non-veg meal as broiler chicken prices, which account for nearly 50 percent of the thali, fell 8-10 percent.Food prices have kept the overall inflation print above the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4 percent. Retail inflation rose to 5.69 percent in December from 5.55 percent in the previous month.Lower vegetable prices led to slowing of price momentum in inflation in December. The Consumer Food Price Index was down 0.9 percent month-on-month (MoM).The RBI's monetary policy committee (MPC) is expected to hold rates on February 8. In its December meeting, the MPC said the unpredictability around food inflation and volatile crude prices in an uncertain international environment posed risk to the inflation outlook.The MPC said that the disinflation process needed to be sustained and it would carefully monitor for any signs of generalisation of food price pressures which can fritter away the gains on the core inflation front."

Emerging market currencies are relatively very fairly priced...and we're not expecting for them to appreciate much,"" said Phoenix Kalen, global head of emerging markets research at Societe Generale.""The Fed rate cuts are already well priced and the consequences of U.S. exceptionalism are still unfolding and that's going to have positive implications for the dollar index and negative implications for EM currencies.""While the Indian rupee was predicted to gain only around 0.6% by end-July, the Thai baht and South Korean won which lost 3.4% and 2.5% respectively this year were predicted to gain around 3.5% in the next six months.While EM currencies were largely dependent on the global interest rate cycle mainly led by the Fed, growth headwinds in China remain a key obstacle on their performance.The Chinese yuan was forecast to just recoup its 1.3% losses so far this year in the next six months.South Africa's rand was expected to gain around 2.3% to 18.41/$ in six months as it catches up to broad EM gains, but that would still not wipe out the fall of almost 7% last year.Goldman Sachs wrote in a note the rand offers one of the most attractive combinations of value and real carry, supported by more benign inflation forecasts.However, it remains one of the most dollar-sensitive EM currencies, which makes the risk-reward less compelling under its baseline trajectory of more gradual broad dollar depreciation.The Russian rouble is expected to lose nearly 2% to 92.28/$ while the Turkish lira will weaken over 9% to 33.67/$ in the next six months."
195,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/uk-universities-grapple-with-who-to-prioritise-international-or-domestic-students-12212441.html,UK universities grapple with who to prioritise: International or domestic students?,"February 07, 2024 01:28 PM IST","Recruiting overseas students to supplement a shortfall in revenue is reasonable. When this income stream becomes so important that institutions are willing to prioritise international applicants over better-qualified local students, though, it’s a sign that the system’s incentives have become skewed","Britain has a world-class higher education system that attracts students from across the globe, generates $32 billion a year in exports and serves as a significant source of prestige and influence for the country and its values. It also has a funding model that doesn’t work — and that’s becoming more and more of a problem.Pore through the data on UK universities and the extent to which the sector has become dependent on fees from overseas students is immediately apparent. The share of income from non-European Union students almost quadrupled since the turn of the millennium to 19.1 percent in the 2021/22 academic year. A record 680,000 foreign students arrived that year, blowing past a government target of reaching 600,000 by 2030. The percentage of non-UK students rose to 24 percent of the total, more than double the share two decades earlier.That’s all good, it might be argued. International students pay significantly higher fees than their domestic counterparts and therefore help to subsidise the costs of educating Britain’s young people. This is, after all, why universities have made such efforts to recruit from overseas. The extent of the growth represents a concentration of risk, though. “The higher education sector faces a looming crisis,” a House of Lords committee said in September, arguing the current system of funding was “not sustainable.” It said there was a worrying complacency that the income from international-student fees could be counted on for the long term, despite an increasingly competitive global environment and the risk of geopolitical shifts disrupting student flows.The more immediate threat may be a domestic political backlash. Evidence has been building that universities’ pursuit of higher-paying overseas intakes is squeezing out British applicants. Admittedly, the aggregate data don’t suggest this. Local student numbers have continued to grow, albeit more slowly than the overseas cohort, indicating overall access to higher education has expanded.The more salient question, though, is where and what the domestic cohort studies. Admission to the most competitive courses at the most desirable institutions is getting harder. The Russell Group of 24 leading universities admitted 86,000 domestic students in 2022, down from 102,000 in 2020 and the lowest level since 2014, the Financial Timesreported last year. The Sunday Times added some granular detail to the picture last month with a report showing how 15 universities includingDurham, Bristol and Exeter are offering pathways to overseas students with far lower exam grades than they demand from UK applicants.Universities UK, which represents 142 institutions, contested the findings, saying its admissions processes had been misrepresented — but nevertheless agreed to review them. The Sunday Times allegations tally with other media reports, including a January article in the Financial Times that said the University of York was lowering entry requirements for some overseas applicants in response to financial challenges. Either way, the financial incentive for universities to attract more higher-paying international students by lowering the academic bar is clear.To some extent, Britain’s university chiefs can’t be blamed for seeking alternative sources of revenue. That’s effectively what the governmentencouraged them to do by freezing annual domestic tuition, which has been held at £9,250 ($11,655) since 2017. If fees for UK students had risen in line with retail price inflation since 2012, when they were £9,000, they would be about £14,000 by now. Overseas students pay as much as £38,000, and an average of £22,200. The Russell Group says English universities run a deficit of £2,500 per year on each domestic undergraduate.Recruiting overseas students to supplement a shortfall in revenue is reasonable. When this income stream becomes so important that institutions are willing to prioritise international applicants over better-qualified local students, though, it’s a sign that the system’s incentives have become skewed. Britain should be careful where this leads. Universities are public institutions, and British parents who judge their children to have missed out on a place unfairly will feel justifiably aggrieved. This has the potential to feed into a politically toxic debate over Britain’s immigration policies. The government has already stopped most international students from bringing family to the UK, under rules that took effect at the start of last month.There are no easy answers. Universities urgently need to put their finances on a more stable and sustainable footing. That’s likely to mean a combination of increased fees for UK students and more state funding. Neither looks palatable or even particularly practical right now, given the cost-of-living crisis and other claims on public spending priorities — particularly the National Health Service, which is in a parlous state with waiting lists near record highs.Overseas students are also a market that the UK shouldn’t take for granted. Even if their number may have risen too far, too fast, they should remain a valued component of Britain’s education offering — for both economic and soft-power reasons. There are signs that the government’s anti-immigration rhetoric is already having an effect: Overseas student acceptances fell 36 percent in January compared with a year earlier, according to data provider Enroly.On the bright side, that may alleviate some of the public anxiety over surging overseas student numbers. But it will also widen the black hole in university finances. Britain’s higher-education chiefs have some difficult conversations ahead.Matthew Brooker is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

All three stocks that outperformed the markets so far in 2024 are offering high dividend yields.According to a Quality Dividend Yield Report published by IDBI, there are at least 16 stocks that qualify as quality dividend yield stocks as per their pre-defined filters. The selection criteria used by the research house include more than Rs 800 crore market cap, above 3 percent dividend yield, profit for past three years, and five-year average return on equity of more than 9. Special dividends (one-off) are not taken into consideration, while consistent special dividends are considered for consistent dividend-paying track record.Follow our live blog for all market actionOn the average, these high-dividend-yield shares have gained 11.8 percent on year-to-date basis when the Nifty 50 gained a mere 0.75 percent. In the past one year, the average returns delivered by this set of high dividend yield stocks has been 51.68 percent when the Nifty 50 has gained 24 percent.Will high dividend yield stocks outperform?“In this market, where valuation in many sectors are ahead of fundamentals and this is becoming more a liquidity-driven rally, it is important to bring back your focus on dividend yield stocks. The companies with genuine cash flow can only pay dividends. Therefore, if the dividend yield is decent then it becomes a safety net even if the stock falls. Instead of chasing stocks especially low float PSUs where valuation is not justifiable, it is better to rely on quality high dividend yield stocks,” Purvesh Shelatkar, head of institutional broking at Monarch Networth Capital, said.In 2024 so far, outperformance has seen in stocks from the oil and gas sector, PSUs, PSU banks, energy and realty sectors.

Copilot is Microsoft's AI-powered digital assistant, which is similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT.“I want us to be the co-pilot for India as it really takes advantage of AI, creates its own AI products across all of these sectors, and exports them to the world,” Nadella said in an interview with CNBC-TV18's Shereen Bhan at Microsoft’s ""CEO Connection"" event in Mumbai on February 7.Nadella reached Mumbai earlier in the day on a two-day visit, an annual ritual, with theme for 2024 set as AI and opportunities arising out of it. He is expected in Bengaluru on February 8.India has a tremendous opportunity to use general-purpose technology such as AI and generative AI in a broad sectoral way in both public and private sectors and across industry, Nadella said.Microsoft will keep investing in India on both fronts: as a source of human capital that's producing products for the world and also with the “latest and greatest” equipment helping customers such as the information technology services companies.Also read: We're closely tracking impact of AI on percentage of India's GDP growth: Satya NadellaThe Indian-origin CEO also said AI is changing economic productivity, adding he has not seen a general-purpose technology like AI that can have such a broad impact.Among the areas witnessing massive growth are software development and frontline work in retail and healthcare, he said. AI is also being used by rural area immigrants into the urban area to access services, Nadella said.“I was very stunned… on seeing how some of the leading model work we had done was diffusing in India, and even in something like the public sector,” Nadella told CNBC-TV18.An advantage from this generation of AI is that it reduces the learning curve, Nadella said to query on job losses due to the technology . “So even for somebody displaced mid-career, you can pick up new skills faster, easier,” he said.If the previous era was about “information at your fingertips”, the AI era is about  “expertise at your fingertips” in fields such as retail and healthcare.He said wages may improve as more expert work is being done by non-experts. “They may have domain expertise but they may not have all the knowledge and so therefore, I think that they could even be better wage supported new jobs,” Nadella said.Job displacement, however, is a given when a new technology comes in to the market, he said. “But I also am very optimistic that we even have both the policy tools and the actual tools to help us manage this transition in a net positive way for even a country like India,” Nadella said."

Outside of RMG also we are looking at acquisitions including casual gaming firms and esports platforms. We are in the negotiation stages with the companies. In the next 3-4 months we have a plan to acquire 8 companies and by the end of the year we will acquire all 13 of them,"" he said.Joshua added that GST changes have put pressure on the profitability of RMG companies and consolidation will help mitigate the pressure.""Gaming companies spend 20 percent of their revenue as operational cost which include marketing, salaries, technology cost, among others. By consolidating 7-8 companies we will save at least 15 percent of the companies' expenses. We are able to offset the negative impact of GST and as a larger company we are able to access larger capital pool in terms of investor growth funds. We can grow faster as a portfolio company than an individual firm. There will be a lot of consolidation at an operating level with cost efficiencies that will build in,"" he said.The company has earmarked $120 million for the first phase of acquisitions which include eight firms. ""We are expanding our pool to accommodate rest of the companies. We have founders capital and family offices that are backing us for these acquisitions,"" said Joshua.Consolidation is the way forward in the gaming sector, said Paul Micheal, CEO of OneVerse Gaming.""We saw a lot of small gaming cos mushrooming both pre and post-pandemic. I realised that for this industry the time has come for consolidation even before the GST change because of too much of competition and companies not knowing the system that would have killed the market. Hence, I pushed the narrative and spoke to these companies that we are acquiring.""Micheal said that as a larger gaming company, they will be able to offer better technology to users, and higher rewards which will lead to more player retention.""We will have the scale (after the acquisitions) because of which we will be able to offer higher bonuses and rewards to players which other companies are unable to do so today. We have identified companies with healthy unit economics and the companies we have acquired are profitable,"" Joshua said.The company, which has been building metaverse relations based on virtual reality experiences on the Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro for sectors including real estate and healthcare, among others, will expand its reach to gaming.""We will have gamers experiencing gaming on Apple Vision Pro. We have a head start of two years in offering these experiences versus other companies. We will start going live on metaverse and start deploying immersive experience for our customers (in gaming) and we will be able to give to customers better technology,"" said Joshua, adding that OneVerse's gaming business is profitable.""It looks like gaming could become the largest portfolio (for Oneverse) after the acquisition deals close,"" the founder noted."

The MPC is scheduled to meet from February 6 to 8. The RBI has kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent since February 2023, when the rate was raised from 6.25 percent. The central bank has raised the repo rate by 250 basis points (bps) since May 2022.If the MPC maintains status quo on February 8, this will be the sixth consecutive pause in the last one year. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.“The RBI will look at keeping the repo rate unchanged at 6.5 percent in the coming MPC meeting. We expect no change in stance as well,” said AK Srivastava, managing director and chief executive officer (MD and CEO), Indian Overseas Bank.Rajiv Ahuja, executive director, RBL Bank, echoed Srivastava’s views. “Expect a status quo in the coming MPC and the stance would be neutral,” Ahuja said.Also read: Moneycontrol Poll | Bankers, economists expect MPC to leave repo rate unchanged on Thursday""We believe the RBI may keep a status quo on key policy rates, however the focus on fiscal consolidation in the recent Interim budget,"" said George Alexander Muthoot, MD, Muthoot Finance. The war against inflation The central bank in the last few years was seen battling hard to contain the rate of inflation and it has somehow managed to bring it down to its comfort band of 2-6 percent in the last few months. While it is within the RBI’s tolerance band, inflation is however above the medium-term target of 4 percent, and the focus now is to get there.India's headline retail inflation rate accelerated to a four-month high of 5.69 percent in December, according to data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on January 12, thanks to an unfavourable base effect. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation print in November was 5.55 percent. At 5.69 percent in December, the latest CPI inflation figure is below expectations, with economists predicting that prices likely rose 5.9 percent in the year to December 2023 compared to the previous 12 months.So when do we see rate cuts? On January 18, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das, during an interaction with a private television channel had said: “At this time, the topic of rate cut is not on our table, it’s not even under discussion. Our focus is to remain actively disinflationary, to bring the inflation to 4 percent.” Bankers suggested that the central bank will look at lowering rates in the second half of calendar year 2024, highlighting that the rates have peaked, nudging the RBI towards a cut.Dinesh Khara, the State Bank of India chairman, said that the RBI belongs to this school of thought. “Expect rate cuts in the second half of 2024,” Khara said at the post-results media conference.“The rates are more or less near the peak now and it looks possible that the repo rate might come down in the second half of the calendar year,” said Ittira Davis, MD and CEO, Ujjivan Small Finance Bank."

They will fund a growing economy and will benefit from an overall revival of the banking system, according to Bagga","The Indian equity market may be poised for another rally before the general elections, even as the timeline for Fed rate cut gets pushed out to the second half of the year.In an interview to Moneycontrol, market expert Ajay Bagga shares his perspective on the unfolding Paytm saga amid the recent regulatory actions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) targeting payments banks that have sent ripples through the fintech ecosystem, prompting investors to re-evaluate their positions. Edited excerpts:What are your thoughts on the current market scenario and the likelihood of rate cuts from the Fed?The current market scenario is marked by anticipation surrounding both domestic and international factors. While earlier expectations included the possibility of multiple rate cuts from the Fed, recent developments, including a robust US economy and clear messaging from the Federal Reserve suggest a shift in expectations.The likelihood of rate cuts has diminished, with indications pointing towards no cuts until June or July. This adjustment in market sentiment, coupled with the upcoming elections, introduces a level of uncertainty regarding market movements.Despite this, I see the potential for one more rally before the elections, that could drive markets to new highs. But once the new government is formed, a lot will depend on the full-year budget in July and what happens around there.Should investors consider buying private sector banks amidst underperformance and liquidity issues?While private sector banks currently face challenges such as underperformance and liquidity issues, there are underlying factors that make them attractive long-term investment prospects. Despite short-term setbacks, private sector banks are a long-term buy as they will be the suppliers of capital into a growth economy. Additionally, improvements in the balance sheets of PSU banks suggest broader opportunities within the banking sector despite their recent run up. Remember, PSUs are playing catch up after a decade's underperformance. Recently, government said that PSU banks have earned Rs 98,000 crore as against Rs 70,000 crore last year. That's the kind of re-rating on the balance sheet for PSU banks. So banks will continue to do well.Also Read: What’s next for Paytm stock after 3% recovery? Don’t buy yet, if you don’t have huge risk appetiteWhat's your perspective on the recent regulatory actions targeting Paytm Payments Bank and its impact on the fintech ecosystem?The recent regulatory actions targeting payments banks reflect the importance of regulatory compliance within the fintech ecosystem.As a highly regulated sector, financial services require adherence to strict standards to safeguard consumer interests and maintain market stability. While the specific implications of these regulatory actions are still unfolding, it underscores the need for fintech companies to navigate regulatory frameworks effectively. RBI would not take such a big measure without understanding the implications. It is one of the best regulators in the world. If you remember,  five payment banks licences were surrendered by the promoters on their own out of the 11 that were given.The model itself is very difficult to make money on and, including say, a Vodafone and Pesa, which worked in East Africa, did not work in India. They gave back their licence. You can't really blame the regulator for this and we don't have enough information to make judgments. You know, the fintech guys are writing articles that RBI doesn't know the digital ecosystem. I don't think so.Also read: Paytm jumps 10% to hit upper circuit after large trade of sharesSo would you advise investors to stay away from the stock amid the ongoing regulatory scrutiny?Yes I would... I don't want to comment on the company. It might be a great company, might be run by great people but when there's so much noise around it, it's fair to presume that it may not end anytime soon. So get all the information and then take a call. Don't go by what FIIs or brokerages are doing, do your due diligence, gather more information and then take a call.Yes, maybe you missed this opportunity, no problem. Right now the problem is very big. RBI doesn't shut down banks, it asks other banks to take over. So, for the RBI to virtually shut down a bank there has to be a reason. Their decisions are well thought out and their big mandate is market stability. RBI will not make the market unstable.Also read: RBI may cancel licence of Paytm Payments BankThe start-up ecosystem in India is thriving despite risks because the country offers access to a vast consumer market, and presents lucrative opportunities for profit. Investors and stakeholders are drawn to this potential for financial gain rather than solely aiming to enhance our lives.Therefore, amidst concerns raised by private equity entities and vested interests about regulatory actions impacting the start-up ecosystem, it's essential to recognise the underlying motivations driving participation in the market: financial gain within a robust consumer landscape.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

With the government presenting an unexpectedly prudent budget on February 1, could the RBI drop a hint on February 8 that rate cuts may be around the corner?","Exactly one week after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim budget for 2024-25, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das will announce the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) interest rate decision on February 8.While there is unlikely to be anything substantially new from a monetary policy perspective, the finance ministry may have given Das and his fellow rate-setters some food for thought.To be sure, no one really expects the RBI to actually lower the policy repo rate on February 8. In fact, it would be a huge surprise if even a single member of the MPC votes to cut interest rates this week. But an unexpectedly low fiscal deficit target of 5.1 percent of GDP for 2024-25 will not go unnoticed.""From the RBI's vantage point, the fiscal policy will likely be seen as complementing the monetary policy,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said.""While the RBI's MPC is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged on February 8, we expect the first steps to address tight frictional liquidity and a more active discussion on removing the tightening bias in the policy guidance,"" they added.Varma and Nandi see the first rate cut in August, with risks skewed towards the easing cycle beginning in June.Liquidity has indeed become an issue. While linked to the stance of monetary policy, the banking system's liquidity has been in 'withdrawal of accommodation' mode for the better part of two years now and has seemingly been fully withdrawn considering the weighted average call rate is above the repo rate and the RBI is conducting variable rate reverse repo auctions almost on a daily basis.""…the infusion of durable liquidity is becoming necessary, and idealistically, the monetary policy stance should change to 'neutral' from 'withdrawal of accommodation' to maintain consistency of stance and action,"" Soumyajit Niyogi, a director at India Ratings and Research's Core Analytical Group, said.Will the MPC then change its stance to neutral this week?If one goes by the RBI's inflation forecast, there may or may not be a case. Sure, the MPC finally does have visibility when it comes to its inflation target, with the central bank's latest forecasts seeing Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation hitting 4 percent in July-September, before rising to 4.7 percent in October-December.But a sustained reduction in inflation is what matters. As external member Ashima Goyal has previously said, a sequence of forecasts showing a sub-5 percent headline retail inflation would present an opportunity to reduce interest rates.Then there is core inflation. From as high as 6.1 percent in the first couple of months of 2023, retail inflation, excluding food and fuel items, had dropped dramatically to under 4 percent by the end of the calendar year.According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's group chief economic adviser, a ""behavioural shift"" – demand shifting from offline to online – may explain why core CPI inflation has fallen so steeply.""If this is sustained, the decline in core inflation could become more enduring in nature, opening up space for policy rate cuts,"" Ghosh said.Like Nomura's Varma and Nandi, Ghosh thinks August is the ""best bet"" for the first rate cut from the MPC, although he sees the possibility of it coming in June, too."

IEAs 2030 projections for Indian oil demand supply growth.The report comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was heavily investing in the energy sector, emphasizing that the sector would get highest infrastructural push.The faster pace of oil consumption reflects the emergence of a burgeoning middle class, characterised by higher living standards and changing spending habits, IEA said, adding that as consumers become wealthier, they are more inclined to purchase energy-intensive big-ticket items such as cars and domestic appliances.India is set to maintain its position as a key exporter of transportation fuelsto markets in Asia and the Atlantic Basin, the agency noted and forecast new refining capacity to boost product supplies to global markets to 1.4 mb/d through mid-decade before edging lower to 1.2 mb/d by 2030 if the domestic demand holds steady.So far, India's oil marketing companies (OMCs) benefitted  from discounted Russian crude and significant inventory gains, offsetting the impact of unchanged retail prices of petrol and diesel. ""Over the next seven years, 1 mb/d of new refinery distillation capacity will be added – more than any other country in the world outside of China,"" IEA added.Oil demand strengthened by road transportAccording to the report, road transport leads the oil demand growth of the world's third-largest oil importer. The agency noted car ownerships in in India is limited and  low in international terms but the  size of the Indian car fleet is poised to grow more than 40 percent by 2030.Commenting on the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) among Indian consumers, IEA said it estimates that electrification will displace more than 200 kb/d of oil consumption by 2030, with about 70%coming from lower gasoline use.About 3.5 million EVs were registered in India by the end of 2023,according to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.Meanwhile, IEA said that India’s total aviation activity and jet fuel requirements were roughly equal to those of France, leaving substantial potential for growth.Indian oil production on declineAccording to the report, output recorded in 2023 came at  just under700 kb/d, of which crude oil production was 600 kb/d, as compared to the peak of  over 900 kb/d in 2011.""The more supportive policy and investment regime, combined with favourable geology in recently opened and under explored areas, offers potential opportunities to bring on new supplies,"" IEA said."

Insurance companies, led by LIC with a substantial 68 percent share (Rs13.02 lakh crore) in equity investments, collectively sold a net of Rs 15,622 crore during the quarter.Domestic mutual funds reached a record high share of 8.81 percent in NSE-listed companies by the December quarter, up from 8.73 percent in the quarter ended in September 2023, driven by net inflows of Rs 58,198 crore, according to a Prime Database report.Despite net inflows of Rs 54,925 crore, the overall share of Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) decreased slightly to 15.96 percent by the December quarter.

Over the last 15 years, the government holding in listed PSUs dropped to 22.48 percent, mainly because of divestment, while promoter holding in NSE-listed companies too hit a five-year low of 41.31 percent at the end of the third quarter of this fiscal. In the past year alone, it fell by 330 basis points. Promoters took advantage of the bullish market, and lower holding in companies going public contributed to this decline, Haldea said.The stakes with retail investors dipped marginally to 7.57 percent, with a net sell-off of Rs 12,163 crore, while that of high net-worth individuals (HNIs) increased marginally to 2.06 percent. Combined retail and HNI share dropped to 9.63 percent, but the overall retail, HNI, and MF share reached an all-time high of 18.44 percent by Q3, Prime Database report added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

He added that TCI is aiming for a 10-15 percent topline growth in FY25. Edited excerpts:Q. What has been the biggest impact of the Red Sea disruptions on your business and how do you expect that to change in the next quarter or so?A. There hasn't been a direct impact of the Red Sea disruptions on our business as we don't operate on those waters.However, the rise in bunker fuel prices, coupled with the slowdown in import-export traffic, and the rise in insurance costs have had a trickle-down on the domestic economy as a whole, which has impacted our operations as well.Q. In Q3, TCI’s revenue from its freight division and operating margins fell below 4 percent. What were the biggest reasons for the fall?A. Our freight business was affected to some extent by the slowdown in the economy where the core sector, which we've seen, has been slowing.So we do a lot of work on the engineering, electricals and those kinds of industries and we've seen that to be a little slower in the last two quarters and that has had an impact on the business.Secondly, the margin structure also got affected because we weren't able to grow the business as much, and then you have some amount of cost structure that kicks in. So that also had a little bit of a negative impact.But Q4 is typically the best quarter for us, and we are anticipating good growth in this period. And then that should continue on… Some amount of inflationary pressure on the consumer side was also seen and that also had a little bit of a negative impact.Q. Do you expect the slowdown in the core sector to continue for the next quarter or two, until after the general elections in India?A. There is some amount of slowdown because of the elections, but there's also some amount of business that tends to increase with elections. We'll have to wait and see. I don't expect the slowdown to continue for much longer.Q. The government recently said logistics costs in the country ranged from 7.8 percent to 8.9 percent of GDP for FY22. How accurate are the government's estimates?A. I'm not going to counter what the government has done in terms of saying that I have a specific framework to evaluate the logistics cost in India. We will have to go by what the government is saying. And I think that's fair in terms of the cost structure.However, as a country, we need to now start thinking more of productivity versus the cost structure. How can we enhance productivity for the logistics sector by looking at improvements in the way that we operate, standardisation of trucks, for example, or utilising our processes as much as possible. All of these things are very critical to now look at the next stage of managing this logistics cost, whatever be the number.Q. At the start of the year you estimated double-digit topline and bottom line growth in FY24. Are you confident of meeting your guidance?A. Q4 is typically the best quarter for us and I think we will get to—our guidance is now between 8 percent and 10 percent for the full year. So I think we are looking at that for the time being.Q. What are your top line and EBITDA margin targets for FY25? And what are your capital expenditure plans?A. 10-15 percent, which we think will start with the new government coming in and the new budget. We think the traction to growth will be quite high in the next quarter.As far as capex goes, we have spent Rs 150 crore so far in nine months. Our capex budget – we reduced it in quarter two from Rs 375 crore to Rs 275 crore because the ship purchase is not happening in one shot, but we have to give timely payments every year. So, instead of one block payment, it is divided into instalments.That should bring our total capex closer to Rs 250-260 crore from a budget of Rs 275 crore. Next year also we are looking at Rs 250 crore.We have spent most of our capex this year on acquiring 500 containers.Q. Is TCI looking to move away from fossil fuel-run trucks? What is the fleet size that you operate at the moment?A. We have converted some of our fleet already into CNG trucks. We have close to 200 CNG trucks that we are operating out of our fleet of 1,000 trucks.Some of our clients are also asking for last-mile to be electric vehicles. We are talking to a few vendors to incorporate those EV trucks."

The first goal is to increase their topline to the 2022-23 level and come as close to the previous levels as possible.,"Railways consultancy firm RITES will aggressively bid for export and consultancy orders in the remainder of 2023-24 and in 2024-25 to make up for the fall in revenues from the Indian Railways' quality assurance/inspection division, Rahul Mithal, the company's CMD, told Moneycontrol.""In terms of order inflow across all my four streams of revenue, in the October-December quarter, RITES won more than 100 orders, which is more than one order a day, and going forward we are confident that this order win momentum will continue,"" he said.RITES secured more than 100 orders worth Rs 612 crore in the quarter that ended December 31, 2023, to make up for the fall in its revenues and net profit in 2023-24 due to the Indian Railways reducing the rates for quality assurance/inspection tenders since the start of the year.Out of the total order, Rs 270 crore came from consultancy orders, Rs 288 crore from exports, Rs 28 crore from leasing orders and Rs 26 crore from turnkey orders.“The new rates of railway inspection are, on average, about 1/5th of the earlier rates,"" Mithal said, adding that around 60 percent of RITES’ quality assurance revenues came from Railway tenders.RITES Ltd on February 1 reported a 12.5 percent drop in consolidated profit at Rs 128.78 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. The company had posted a profit of Rs 147.18 crore for the year-ago period.Income dropped to Rs 699.85 crore from Rs 703.38 crore in the year-ago period and the company ended Oct-Dec with an order book of Rs 5,496 crore.Edited Excerpts:When we last spoke after your Q1 results you had mentioned that RITES will look to aggressively pursue export and consultancy orders, how has that strategy panned out so far?If you look at our last nine months, our total revenues have fallen 7.6 percent, EBITDA is down 15.1 percent, EBITDA margins are down to 26 percent from 28 percent and profit after tax is down 17 percent.The fall in revenues from the railway inspection business has been a major challenge we have faced in the last three quarters and our strategy to mitigate this challenge has been to maximise revenue from the project consultancy stream.Our project consultancy business, not including our railway inspection business, has grown by 21 percent, which is why despite a significant hit on our revenues due to the new railway inspection rates, which are 1/5th of earlier rates, revenues from our consultancy segment have grown by nearly 6 percent.Our order book from the segment has increased to around Rs 2,600 crore from Rs 2,500 crore last year. We have also been pushing for export orders and in Q3 we won our first export order of about Rs 300 crore to supply 10 locomotives to Mozambique Ports and Railway.Apart from this, RITES has also emerged as L1 for an approximate Rs 900 crore order from Bangladesh Railways to supply 200 broad gauge passenger carriages.In 2024-25 RITES aims to return its revenues and net profit to the 2022-23 level and then build from there. We are confident in our ability to win more consultancy orders and move away from turnkey orders.In around two to three quarters our first goal is to increase our topline to the 2022-23 level and then obviously the margins will be much tighter, then grow further and EBITDAs come as close to the previous levels as possible.Apart from the order wins from CFM, Mozambique, and Bangladesh Railway, are there any other major export orders you are confident about?As of now, we have participated in several tenders at some very aggressive bids which we've been doing for the last three, or four quarters. We have been bidding across geographies, both in Africa and other areas. So there are things in the pipeline. We are also in negotiation with certain agreements and contracts, and we are looking forward to some maturing in the coming quarters.It may be premature to say something right now.The Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the creation of three new railway corridors, and the Railway Minister highlighted that around 440 projects have been identified to create these corridors. How many of these projects is RITES in the mix for and what can be seen as a realistic timeline for the creation of these corridors?If you look at the capital expenditure push by the government for the last few years, a lot of capex has gone into creating new semi-high-speed alignments.We have been getting orders from different sections of the Indian Railways for works like the identification of semi-high speed corridors, upgradation of corridors to semi-high speed, alignment studies, and connectivity projects. The announcement of these new corridors will be in line with the ongoing upgradation of the Indian Railways.Similarly, if you look at the second corridor announced which will enhance port connectivity, we are already getting a lot of connectivity work from various clients like the PSUs, whether it is coal fields, steel plants, etc.Going forward, as the government comes out with a more streamlined roadmap for the development of these corridors the scope of consultation work for RITES will only increase.The Finance Minister also announced plans to upgrade 40,000 standard rail coaches to Vande Bharat standards, what is the opportunity RITES is eyeing in the same?Yes. So we'll see how this pans out. We already are in the inspection business.We have different verticals, our inspection vertical, and our technical design vertical. I'm sure that we will leverage some portions of this as this pans out.The last time we spoke you had mentioned that RITES has signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Railways of Zimbabwe for the supply of rolling stock worth around Rs 650 crore, can you share details on that contract?So far that contract has not materialised. The agreement is in place and we are closely working with them to help them get funding from the African Development Bank. The way things are moving, we are hopeful that the funding should get in place.What is RITES’ capital expenditure, revenue and order inflow guidance for 2024-25?Our aim for 2023-24 will be to consolidate and come as close to 2022-23 as possible, in terms of revenues. In 2024-25 we are hoping that some of these export orders will materialise and start contributing to our revenues.We are aiming for a double-digit growth on the EBITDA level in 2024-25 when compared to 2023-24.In terms of our order inflows, we will aim to grow our revenues from all four streams of revenue and maintain the pace of winning one order a day for the next two quarters.You see our capital expenditure has been in the range of about Rs 120 crore-130 crore for the last few years, and there's going to be no major change in this model."

In a report, the analysts have rejected positive outlook on the sector, citing concerns about near-term focus, profitability, and overlooking risks in the medium term, business models, and disruptions.PSU stocks surged 19-443 percent in the past year, led by capital goods, electric utilities, financials, and oil and gas. ""We find certain assumptions, surrounding the medium-to-long-term growth and profitability of these sectors, to be highly optimistic. We doubt much has changed in most sectors,"" the Kotak report said.PSUs in capital goods experienced a notable rerating on the back of increased order flow, but Kotak has warned of underestimated risks in assuming prolonged large order inflows, especially in sectors like thermal electricity generation. ""The government’s three-in-one role of buyer, owner and policymaker or regulator creates uncertainty regarding the companies’ future earnings and returns,"" it said.In electric utilities, Kotak notes a significant rerating, highlighting NTPC's valuation concerns and the market's overestimation of growth potential for PowerGrid. The transition to solar electricity and competitive tariff-based bidding projects pose risks, according to the analysts."" We are puzzled by the market’s confidence,"" Kotak wrote on the rally in state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs). In OMCs, the rerating was driven by high profitability assumptions, but Kotak has questioned market confidence, citing volatile marketing margins and optimistic profitability assumptions. ""The government pricing policy uncertainty and low FCF-to-PAT ratios make P/E-based valuations irrelevant,"" it said.Portfolio revisionKotak said it has added Pidilite Industries to its portfolio with a weight of 150 basis points while exiting PowerGrid Corp (190 bps). The brokerage house has redistributed the remaining 40 bps to SBI Life.PowerGrid Corp's robust performance, with a 69 percent return over the past year, is now trading at 2.4X FY2026 BV — a considerable premium compared to its fair multiple of around 1.5X BV. While historically viewed as a prime investment for India's electrification, current valuations seem to be reflecting the anticipated growth opportunities for the next few years, it said.The brokerage house is reassured by Pidilite's strong earnings visibility in the thriving residential real estate up-cycle, expecting it to continue for the next few years. Pidilite's solid market position and potential weakening competition are factors contributing to this confidence. The company's profitability, despite recent price cuts and increased advertising and promotion spending, is considered comfortable.Additionally, Pidilite's low risk of disruption sets it apart from other building materials products. Adhesives, a key product, are likely to remain B2C, unlike other building products that may transition to B2B as development trends shift towards larger projects by major developers, Kotak said.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The audacious move comes as the company navigates bankruptcy proceedings, with Neumann aiming to inject much-needed cash to salvage the once high-flying real-estate juggernaut.Here is a snapshot of the goings-on at WeWork company and its enigmatic founder:The timelineIn 2010, Neumann kicked off WeWork, turning what seemed like a simple real estate venture into a $47-billion behemoth by 2019.But come September 2019 and cracks started appearing in WeWork's shiny facade. Neumann stepped down as CEO amid murmurs of questionable dealings and a rather raucous company culture.WeWork has been facing bankruptcy proceedings since November. The company is trying to renegotiate a bunch of leases that they think are way too costly but things are far from smooth. The company tried to withhold rent from landlords who weren't playing ball but it has not worked.Its initial public offering (IPO), once the golden ticket to success, hit a snag as investors raised eyebrows at WeWork's valuation, forcing its withdrawal.Investors may have taken a knock but Neumann walked away from the chaos with pockets full, thanks to SoftBank's hefty payout of $480 million in 2021. Talk about a golden parachute!Fast forward to 2024 and the WeWork ship is still sailing through stormy waters. Bankruptcy looms large as debts pile up and the company's future hangs in the balance.Neumann, ever the maverick, wants to be back in the game. Reports have said Neumann's latest real estate venture, Flow Global, has expressed interest in acquiring WeWork or its assets. The company has also offered to provide bankruptcy financing to support WeWork and prevent it from sinking further.Neumann and his legal team have put forward a $200 million financing plan from his startup to help WeWork with restructuring.This cash infusion would offer a short-term financial lifeline, with priority for repayment. As a result, Neumann could hold considerable sway over the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings. He, however, may need support from WeWork's major creditors, including SoftBank Group Corp and investment firms like King Street, Silver Point, and Brigade Capital Management, who control most of the company's secured debt.Neumann's proposal to inject cash into WeWork might be met with some hesitation as the man who once steered the ship into troubled waters now wants to grab the helm again.

During the first nine months of this financial year (April-December 2023), the Chennai-based CV maker sold 87,736 units of medium-and heavy- duty trucks (7 percent up YOY).While giving an overview of its financial results, the homegrown CV maker stated that the demand trajectory remains good for the rest of the period, albeit higher than the fourth quarter base last year.  The Hinduja flagship company had also indicated that it would remain at above 30 percent market share in the M&HCV space and move towards a 35 percent market share going forward.As Dheeraj Hinduja , Executive Chairman of ALL puts it, “I'm confident that with the strength of the current and new products backed by continuous expansion of sales network, we will continue to grow in both  the M&HCV and LCV (segments) Despite challenging international market conditions, we have managed to stay marginally ahead of the volumes clocked last year.”While stating that its growth in the M&HCV space is in line with industry growth, he also indicated that the company  will drive growth in non-MHCV businesses covering the Aftermarket, Defense and Power Solutions businesses.The BSE-listed company asserted that it has posted the “highest record performance” for nine months, selling 1,38,416 units of Commercial vehicles across segments. It has grown by 65 per cent in the bus segment, which is almost twice the industry growth.Thanks to a high vehicle offtake, the company clocked a revenue of Rs 27,100 crore for a nine month period of April-December 2023, with the highest EBITDA of Rs 3,014 crore and the highest PAT of Rs 1,718 crore.Shenu Aggarwal, CEO of Ashok Leyland revealed that in the M&HCV space, on a  nine month basis the industry has grown by 9 percent and Ashok Leyland by 7 percent.“While the growth has been across all segments, M&HCVs have been growing slightly better this year. Within the M&HCV segment, the bus market is moving very well and saw the highest growth so far in this year. The second one is the tractor-trailer segment , which is also showing very good signs of growth. The third one is the tipper segment. These sub-segments are growing faster than the rest of the segments,” Agarwal told Moneycontrol.He revealed that most of the sectors such as steel mining, roads, etc., are doing well, e-commerce and rural ones are ""slightly subdued”.It may be recalled that India's eight core sectors posted a growth of 3.8 percent in December, according to data released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on January 31.Ashok Leyland has also improved its market share from 28.2 per cent last year to 33 per cent in the overall CV market.Bottomline skyrocketsDespite growing just 2 percent in its topline at Rs 9,273 crore during the third quarter of FY24, Ashok Leyland witnessed a 60 percent increase in its bottomline at Rs 580 crore. The company attributed a combination of factors such as good volumes, better price realisation and higher cost savings to boost its bottomline during Q3 FY24.When asked to cite reasons behind the growth in profits, Aggarwal revealed, “We have been able to maintain a very strong price discipline. We are not going to sacrifice margins because of (gaining ) market share.  Secondly, we had (made) a humongous effort on the cost savings like last year. The third factor is, the commodity prices has also softened a little bit, which helped improve our margin.”Meanwhile, Ashok Leyland is gearing up to widen its presence in the EV segment.  It has recently handed over the first set of keys of the 14-tonne Boss Electric Trucks to Billion E-Mobility at the Bharat Mobility Global Expo in New Delhi."

""It had turned positive but now oil companies are losing close to Rs 3 per litre."" He said the profit margin on petrol has trimmed from low teens to around Rs 3-4 a litre.Asked about fuel price revision, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told reporters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week that the government does not dictate prices and the oil companies take their decision considering all economic aspects.""They say there is still volatility (in the market),"" he said.Asked about the bumper Rs 69,000 crore profits that the three firms have clocked in the first nine months of the current fiscal, he said the expectation would be to start price revision if the trend continues in the fourth and last quarter of the current fiscal year ending March 31.""They had losses when they voluntarily decided not to raise prices (despite oil prices going up),"" he said.The combined net profit of IOC, BPCL and HPCL in the April-December (first nine months of current fiscal year) was better than their annual earning of Rs 39,356 crore in pre-oil crisis year, regulatory filings by them showed.The firms had posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during the April-September 2022 despite accounting for Rs 22,000 crore announced but not paid LPG subsidy for the previous two years. Subsequent softening of international prices and government giving out LPG subsidy helped IOC and BPCL post annualised profit for 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal) but HPCL was in the red.This fiscal year, things have changed dramatically. The three firms posted record quarterly earnings in the first two quarters (April-June and July-September) when international oil prices - against which domestic rates are benchmarked - almost halved to USD 72 a barrel from a year ago. International prices rose again in the subsequent quarter to USD 90, leading to moderation of their earnings.But, on a year as a whole they had rich profits.The fuel price freeze that began on April 6, 2022, had a loss as high as Rs 17.4 a litre on petrol and Rs 27.7 per litre on diesel for the week ended June 24, 2022. However, subsequent softening led to losses being eliminated. The three firms had a margin of Rs 11 a litre on petrol and Rs 6 on diesel last month.But now things have changed, another industry official explained.International oil prices have been turbulent in the last couple of years. It dipped into the negative zone at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and swung wildly in 2022 - climbing to a 14-year high of nearly USD 140 per barrel in March 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, before sliding on weaker demand from top importer China and worries of an economic contraction.But for a nation that is 85 per cent dependent on imports, the spike meant adding to already elevated levels of inflation and derailing the economic recovery from the pandemic.So the three fuel retailers froze petrol and diesel prices for the longest duration in the last two decades. They stopped daily price revision in early November 2021 when rates across the country hit an all-time high, prompting the government to roll back a part of the excise duty hike it had effected during the pandemic to take advantage of low oil prices.The freeze continued into 2022 but the war-led spike in international oil prices prompted a Rs 10 a litre hike in petrol and diesel prices from mid-March 2022 before another round of excise duty cut rolled back all of the Rs 13 a litre and Rs 16 a litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel done during the pandemic.That followed the current price freeze that began on April 6, 2022 and still continues."

394,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/chinas-clean-technology-is-made-of-dirty-metals-12209191.html,China’s clean technology is made of dirty metals,"February 07, 2024 10:32 AM IST","Decarbonisation is fueling consumption of metals, chemicals and glass, which are in turn causing a lot of greenhouse pollution as they’re manufactured. Clean-energy products are much more efficient than the alternative once they’re being used — but producing them is causing a spike in carbon emissions","Two months ago, the world’s governments signed on to an ambitious program for decarbonisation. The capacity of renewable power worldwide would triple by 2030, while energy efficiency would improve at double existing rates, delegates to the COP28 climate meeting in Dubai agreed.Right now, those two objectives are pushing in opposite directions.To see why, look at China. The country is likely to build the lion’s share of new renewable capacity. At the same time, it’s responsible for about a third of the world’s emissions — and its efficiency is worsening. That’s almost certainly connected to the vast volumes of materials all those solar panels, electric vehicles, and wind turbines are using up, and the coal that’s getting burned in producing them.Electricity consumption rose at a blistering 6.7 percent pace last year, the China Electricity Council, a trade group, said last week. If you still think China isn’t using energy in the lavish manner of rich countries, think again. In 2023, power demand came to about 6.54 megawatt-hours per person — about a third more than the average Italian or UK resident. This year, China’s per-capita electricity use is likely to overtake France and Germany.No other country is installing renewable power at anything like China’s speed, but such a headlong rate of demand growth makes it very hard for clean energy to keep pace. Just the increase in electricity consumption last year was equivalent to all the power generated in Germany. With drought drying up hydro dams, coal ended up supplying nearly three-quarters of the additional electricity. Thermal power increased by 6.1 percent from a year earlier, a faster pace than the economy as a whole — a clear signal that China’s carbon efficiency is going backward.What we’re seeing is a race between renewable energy installations and power demand, with the fate of the planet in the balance. The scale of wind and solar build-out in China looks impressive, but electricity consumption is rising so fast that it’s still not enough to stop the country burning yet more coal.It would be a little comforting if this was a result of an improvement in Chinese people’s living standards, but that’s not what’s happening. Households only take about 15 percent of grid power, compared to 38 percent in the US. The driver of China’s electricity demand growth is instead the energy-intensive, carbon-emitting production of basic materials such as metal, glass, cement, chemicals and plastics.Grid demand from those sectors rose by about 5.3 percent last year, according to the council, well ahead of the anemic 0.9 percent from households, and accelerating toward the end of the year. While that trailed the 11.3 percent pace in high-tech manufacturing, basic materials use so much electricity — about 29 percent of China’s total power generation in 2021 — that they’re still responsible for most of the rise in energy usage, as well as the consequent coal consumption and carbon emissions.The problem is that most of the new demand for these materials is coming from clean-tech industries the energy transition desperately needs. The boom sectors in China’s economy last year have impeccable green credentials: high-speed trains, solar cells, and electric vehicles saw the biggest jumps in output, at 63 percent, 54 percent and 30 percent, respectively.The basic materials doing best are the ones being bought by those sectors. Output of aluminum alloy for solar panel frames and EV bodies climbed 18 percent; copper, used in everything electrical, rose 14 percent; laminated glass, for solar panels and auto windscreens, gained 9.2 percent.Decarbonisation is fueling consumption of metals, chemicals and glass, which are in turn causing a lot of greenhouse pollution as they’re manufactured. Clean-energy products are much more efficient than the alternative once they’re being used — but producing them is causing a spike in carbon emissions that may be ongoing for as long as current rates of growth are sustained.There’s still reasons to hope that 2023’s dirty energy transition will prove a temporary blip. The full impact of China’s real estate crash is yet to show up in the materials sector. While developers have slashed building starts by about half, they’re still completing them at fairly normal rates as they struggle to raise cash from prospective buyers. Copper, aluminum, zinc and glass are typically used at the end of the build when windows, fittings and wiring are added, so we’re yet to see the collapse that will come when completions start to reflect the current depressed state of starts.Manufacturing clean-energy products right now can be thought of as an investment in years of reduced emissions, as well. A solar panel produced in 2023 will still be generating zero-carbon power at the middle of the century — the pollution, like the cost, is all upfront. A coal power plant built this year, by contrast, will still need to be fed with fresh soot decades into the future.Even so, it’s troubling how years of dazzling growth in China’s clean-energy sector are failing to put more of a dent in its emissions. Time is running short. If the country’s electricity demand growth doesn’t start slowing soon — and the council’s forecast is for another headlong 6 percent pace this year — even its record-breaking rollout of renewable power won’t be enough to avert disaster.David Fickling is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Hon'ble PM @narendramodi ji's vision for India's economic ascent and journey towards becoming the world's third-largest economy is truly inspiring. Privileged to be part of the round table chaired by the PM. His insightful vision is bound to get the global leaders to invest in the massive opportunity in #energytransition that India offers.""Essar had over the years invested Rs 2 lakh crore in sectors ranging from ports to steel plants, oil refining and fuel retailing, power generation, mining, shipping and telecom. It sold its oil refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat and fuel retailing network to Russia's Rosneft-led consortium in an over Rs 86,000 crore deal (USD 13 billion), which was the largest FDI in the sector.Its steel plant was sold to ArcelorMittal-led group in insolvency proceedings.Essar currently owns businesses in the core sectors of energy, metals and mining, infrastructure, services and technology. In the energy sector, it has commercial interests in oil, gas and coal bed methane exploration and production in India, Vietnam and Nigeria, oil refining and retailing in the UK and power generation in India and Canada.The group's aggregate revenues now stand at about USD 15 billion. Its businesses include a 10 million tonnes per annum oil refinery in the UK, 12 trillion cubic feet reserves (including some producing fields) of unconventional hydrocarbons in India, an iron ore mine and pellet project in the US, and a high-grade thermal coal mine with 72 million tonnes of proven reserves in Indonesia, among others.It is now building the UK's first 1 GW blue hydrogen project and is looking to produce green hydrogen and green ammonia in Salaya in Gujarat. It is also investing in the LNG value chain, including LNG trucking and LNG fuel stations."

Shell is open to a part or full sale of the unit, which is expected to fetch an enterprise value of $1.6-1.8 billion","Global energy major Shell Plc has kicked off the sale process for its Indian renewable energy unit Sprng Energy and has started reaching out to prospective buyers for the portfolio, which could fetch an enterprise value of $1.6-1.8 billion, two sources aware of the development told Moneycontrol.Shell acquired the Sprng Energy platform from infrastructure investor Actis in August 2022 for an enterprise value of $1.55 billion, and got a portfolio of 2.1 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy assets and a pipeline of 7.5 GW. Since then Shell has invested around $100 million in the Indian unit to partly repay debt and to fund development of new assets. It has added around 700-800 megawatts of assets to the pipeline.“Shell is working with investment bank HSBC for the proposed stake sale. The Indian portfolio could fetch an enterprise value in the range of $1.6-1.8 billion and an equity value in the range of $800-900 million,” said one of the sources cited above.The sale process is at the preliminary stages and Shell and its advisor have just started reaching out to prospective investors.Prospective buyers who have been reached out include American private equity investors KKR and Canada’s Brookfield, both of whom are active investors in the Indian renewable energy sector and own large portfolios of renewable energy assets.The sources cited above said that Shell is open to selling the entire platform or just a part of it.“They may sell the whole holding company or a part of it. Alternatively, they could also do a part sale of some assets or the entire portfolio of assets. They are open to all ideas and the final structure will depend on the offers they get,” said the first source cited above.A Shell spokesperson declined to comment on Moneycontrol’s queries. Spokespersons for HSBC, KKR and Brookfield also declined to comment.The Indian renewable energy portfolio is not the only such sale that Shell is contemplating.On February 6, Bloomberg reported that Shell Plc is looking to sell part of its stake in a wind farm it built off the coast of the Netherlands as part of measures to drive more value for shareholders.Bloomberg reported that the energy major is seeking to reduce its share in the Hollandse Kust Noord project, built in collaboration with Dutch utility Eneco NV, citing sources. Shell is the majority shareholder in CrossWind, which built the 759-megawatt Dutch offshore wind farm, the report said.“The stake sale in Sprng reflects the new reality of energy markets following the Russia-Ukraine conflict. High oil and gas prices have meant that Western energy companies have been making huge sums of profit from conventional energy sources, driving them to refocus on these sources against betting aggressively on renewable energy,” said the second source cited above.In June 2023, Shell CEO Wael Sawan outlined his new strategy to investors, which included cutting costs, boosting payouts to shareholders and devoting more resources to oil and gas.The company’s shift in focus to oil and gas has attracted investors. Shares of Shell Plc hit a record high in October helped by rising energy prices and geopolitical tensions in the middle east."

Earlier, Paytm top executives held discussions with the RBI brass as well.Separately, there are reports of the central bank weighing the option of superseding the Paytm Payments Bank.Moneycontrol couldn't verify the reports independently.The RBI on January 31 imposed major business restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank including accepting fresh deposits and doing credit transactions after February 29.The central bank said a Comprehensive System Audit report and subsequent compliance validation report of the external auditors revealed persistent non-compliances and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank, warranting further supervisory action.No further deposits or credit transactions or top-ups shall be allowed in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags, NCMC cards, etc. after February 29, 2024, other than any interest, cashbacks, or refunds which may be credited anytime, the RBI said.It, however, said the withdrawal or utilisation of balance by the customers from their accounts, including savings bank accounts, current accounts, prepaid instruments, FASTags, National Common Mobility Cards, etc. will be allowed without any restrictions till the available balance is exhausted.On March 11, 2023, the RBI barred Paytm Payments Bank from onboarding new customers.On February 6, the stock of One 97 Communications, the parent company of Paytm, close at Rs 463 on the National Stock Exchange, up 2.63 percent, after falling over 40 percent in the previous three sessions.Why did the RBI clamp down on Paytm Bank?Moneycontrol has reported that  the RBI decided to act against Paytm Payments Bank after observing a complete disregard for regulatory standards and compliance requirements, thus raising serious concerns about the promoters’ as well as the group’s commitment to transparency.""The present action by the RBI is to protect the financial system and prevent a payment bank, which is a RBI regulated entity dealing in public money, being run in a manner detrimental to the interest of its depositors, customers, and other genuine stakeholders,"" a source told Moneycontrol.Major regulatory breaches The banking regulator found major irregularities in KYC, which exposed the customers, depositors, and wallet holders to serious risk. These include the absence of KYC for a very large number of customers (running into lakhs), PAN validation failures in lakhs of accounts, and single PAN for multiple customers, the person quoted above said.During its probe, the RBI also found that in thousands of cases, the same PAN was linked to more than 100 customers and in some cases to more than 1,000 customers. The it also found that the total value of transactions, running into crores of rupees, was beyond regulatory limits in minimum KYC pre-paid instruments, raising money-laundering concerns.The regulator found that there was an unusually high number of dormant accounts, which are prone to be misused as mule accounts. There are also concerns relating to money-laundering arising from deficiencies in the KYC processes and lack of transaction monitoring system.In lakhs of cases, the accounts and wallets have been frozen by various law enforcement authorities across the country, as these were used for committing digital frauds, the RBI probe found.PPBL’s financial and non-financial business was co-mingled with its promoter group companies in violation of licensing conditions and RBI directions on the matter.Responding to the RBI action, Paytm told the exchanges that it is ""taking immediate steps to comply with RBI directions, including working with the regulator to address their concerns as quickly as possible.Further, the company said depending on the nature of the resolution, it estimates the worst-case impact at Rs 300-500 crore on its annual EBITDA. ""However, the company expects to continue on its trajectory to improve its profitability,"" Paytm added."

The demand for statehood for Ladakh and inclusion in the Sixth Schedule calls for a political review of the situation in Ladakh, and in Jammu and Kashmir, which can help towards making the necessary course correction","In the pre-2019 state of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh was the outlying region. There may have been local rumblings about Kashmir and Jammu getting greater attention. When Article 370 was dismantled which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government at the Centre had also bifurcated the state into Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, and each part was given Union Territory status.While Kashmiris were unhappy over the removal of the special status under Article 370, though it was meant for the whole state, which included Jammu and Ladakh, the people of Jammu were relatively happy that they are on an equal footing with Kashmir. But there have been murmurs of dissatisfaction in Jammu that the BJP’s decision did not turn out to be of much advantage to Jammu. They still have to share the new political status with Kashmir. There was a broad religious angle to the new setup. Kashmir was mostly Muslim, Jammu, despite areas like Doda, was largely Hindu, and Ladakh was largely Buddhist though Shia-dominated Kargil is part of Ladakh.It was perhaps to be expected that the political groups in Ladakh, the Leh Apex Body (LAB) and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA), should have come up with the demand for statehood even as the Supreme Court had heard the case over Article 370 and the demotion of J&K into a Union Territory, had received an assurance from the central government that the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir would be restored. That meant Ladakh was left out in the cold, and it will remain a UT.The demand of Ladakh was inevitable. It would have come up anyway, and it has come up soon enough. Also the demand to be included in the Sixth Schedule to give it a tribal status was in the logic of things. And those who had submitted the memorandum on their demands have rightly cited the cases of Mizoram, Tripura, Sikkim. And they also cited Article 371 – a version of Article 370 having special provisions protecting a set of states and their territories and local people  – which is again a natural demand.  So does this mean that the gambit of undoing Article 370 was a futile exercise? In some ways, Article 370 came with its own mortality written into it when it was called a temporary provision.When the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir is restored, the demand can crop up that Article 371 be extended to it because of cultural characteristics, Kashmir  with its Kashmiri language and living traditions, and Jammu with its Dogri language and traditions. Perhaps it would not be a bad idea if Ladakh was to be re-integrated with Jammu and Kashmir, and the old state is brought under Article 371!This is a tricky issue for the BJP because it had opposed special status for Muslim majority Kashmir Valley, and did not seem to note the fact that Hindu-dominant Jammu and Buddhist-dominant Ladakh were also part of the special status. What is needed is a political review of the situation in Ladakh, and in Jammu and Kashmir, and make the necessary course correction.Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr is a New Delhi-based journalist.

""We would look for earnings growth in IT and banks,"" he tells Moneycontrol in an interview. Edited excerpts:Do you expect more difficulty for Paytm?It is possible. We will have to wait and see how things evolve. However, it is also possible that the worst is behind. As per the management, they are confident that they can migrate most of their existing business from the Paytm bank to other banks with whom they have tie-ups in place. In that case, the eventual loss of business might turn out to be minimal. Under that scenario it will turn out that the stock is trading at an attractive valuation. However, all of that depends on how things evolve.Retail investors who believe that ""since it has already fallen by 40 percent, it cannot fall more"" should remember that there is no law that stops a stock from falling further.Speculative retail traders who like entering troubled waters should be cautioned that if they don't understand the details of what has happened by reading the RBI notification and the Paytm communication and cannot quantify the potential extent of the damage in intrinsic value, they should stay away from the stock. There are numerous other opportunities.For the sophisticated investors who can judge the intrinsic value in both the scenarios of loss of the business and recovery of the business and can compare to current valuations and take a small position of 4-5 percent as part of a portfolio fully understanding that there could be further risks, which are currently not known, can consider it.Also, be cautious of panic selling in the stock.

If other central banks start cutting interest rates, then RBI will be forced to keep those in mind and not let the INR appreciate too much.The RBI's job has become quite complicated. It neither wants the INR to appreciate or depreciate too much. The domestic inflation scenario is quite benign and growth is gaining a good momentum. But the international scenario is where RBI will be vigilant.After reading the interim budget, do you expect several significant announcements from the full budget scheduled to be presented in June-July?Absolutely. The budget was a summarisation of all the work done so far over the last two terms, totalling nearly 10 years. If one reads it closely and connects the dots, it gives a clear strategic road map for the next 25 years as well as for the next five years and connects it to the policies that have evolved over the last 10 years.Also read: APRU increase, 5G monetisation will happen with tariff repair: Gopal Vittal, Airtel MDWhat do you expect from the Q4 earnings after reading the December quarter numbers? What are the things to watch out for?We would rather say that FY25 is going to be quite exciting and there should be ample growth in revenues and earnings in FY25. We would look for earnings growth in IT and banks. This would impact the growth in Nifty earnings significantly for FY25 since banks are nearly 35 percent of the Nifty and IT nearly 15 percent.When the earnings for both banks and IT are normalised and projected for FY25, it appears that the Nifty PE is likely to be below 20, which is quite an attractive valuation.Which are the sectors to look for in FY25?We are optimistic about the market unlocking the mispricing in following growth vectors: digital transformation and artificial intelligence, banks and fintech, power, electric vehicles and clean tech and renewable energy.The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is tightening trading restrictions for both domestic institutional investors and some offshore units. Your take?We would caution investors to just stay away from China. There are a lot of governance issues and transparency issues in that market. Taking the country, political and governance risk besides the economy and currency risks, doesn’t make sense except for extremely sophisticated investors who can assess those risks and have an appetite for those. Further, it is unclear what potential rewards there exist for those investors to take those risks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

But 'buy' recommendations decreased from 25 to 22, while 'hold' and 'sell' calls rose to 5 and 7 from 4 and 5, respectively. The overall sentiment towards the stock remains positive on the Street, characterised by a mood of 'cautious optimism'.Bharat Petroleum's Q3 results fell below analyst estimates on lower gross refining margin (GRM) and weaker marketing margin. Despite a record H1, the Q3 profits declined. Its Q3 refining throughput rose 5 percent on-quarter to 9.9 mmt, with reported GRM at $13.4/bbl, surpassing estimates.While Singapore GRM averages $6.5 per barrel, long-term sustainability is uncertain. Analysts project BPCL's GRM at $13.1/6/6/bbl for FY24/25/26. Mumbai/Bina/Kochi GRMs missed by 39.3 percent/25.7 percent/23.6 percent. The PAT beat is attributed to a 51 percent surge in other income/lower interest cost, despite a marketing inventory loss of Rs 369 crore, according to a Nirmal Bang report.BPCL's implied marketing margin contracted from Rs 7 a litre in 2Q to Rs 4.2 in 3Q, impacted by lower diesel margins and inventory loss. Interest costs dropped significantly QoQ, but higher depreciation and lower other income offset the reduction. The completion of refinery upgrades in Mumbai and Kochi and plans for petrochemical and renewable energy projects at Bina have been announced.According to JP Morgan, despite historical trading at a premium due to better ROE and asset quality management BPCL's valuation premium against IOCL and HPCL may remain limited due to IOCL's aggressive petrochemical expansions.Analysts said retail margin upside is restricted by periodic pricing constraints influenced by political considerations, potentially offsetting analysts' forecasted oil price declines. Clarity on the rights issue timeline, pricing, size, and other details, targeted for completion in FY24, is eagerly awaited by analysts.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

As per the December 2023 draft product guidelines, policyholders terminating their life insurance policies before completing the original tenure would have to pay lower surrender charges, thus taking home more of the premiums paid until then. Surrender charges mean penal charges for making an early exit, in insurance parlance.For example, at present, a policyholder surrendering her policy after paying the second-year premium is entitled to get just 30 percent of her premiums back. If the IRDAI’s December draft were to be finalised in the current form, this ‘premium refund’ could go up by 175 percent, depending on the threshold premium—a concept introduced in the draft paper.“At the meeting with IRDAI officials, most major life insurance companies strongly opposed the provisions of the December 2023 draft that proposes higher surrender values for policyholders, particularly in the early years,” an industry insider privy to the matter told Moneycontrol on the condition that he would not be named.Also read: Higher insurance agent commissions to continue, but IRDAI asks insurers to adhere to EoM capsDisadvantage customers?Insurers want the regulator to make room for principle-based regulations, which could mean that surrender payout calculations would be essentially left to the discretion of insurance companies and their actuaries, subject to certain yet-to-be-defined broad principles.However, not all insurers and stakeholders agree.  A top industry official requesting anonymity said: ""It is highly unlikely that customer interest will be well taken care of if such a dilution goes through. Insurer are citing lower internal rate of return (IRR) for customers as one of the reasons that warrant the rollback, but the fact is that they are simply yielding to pressure from their intermediaries.""According to him, principle-based regulations will not be in customer interest. “For example, earlier, unit-linked insurance policies (Ulips) came with exorbitant built-in higher premium allocation charges, which primarily went towards paying commissions to agents. This caused huge financial losses to customers until the regulator came out with objective regulations on Ulip charge caps. If the shift to principle-based approach goes through, it will be amongst the few instances of exposure drafts undergoing a huge change, resulting in a major rollback,” he said.Discussions to continueEarlier, when the proposal was released, some insurance CEOs and independent experts had expressed concerns around potentially lower returns for policyholders who persist - pay premiums over the long-term or until maturity.“There is an impression that insurers are concerned about the proposed surrender value provisions because of the higher embedded commissions, but that is not the case at all. This is not linked just to agents’ commissions, but also has a lot to do with ALM (asset-liability management) as life insurance products entail long-term investments. Then, there is market-value adjustment to be made,” said a senior insurance executive, who did not wish to be named.Insurers also fear increase in lapsation of policies if the proposed surrender value regulations were to be finalised. “Distributors could induce people to surrender existing policies and switch to newer policies, promising higher returns. And customers, too, could yield easily as they would now (if proposal goes through) have relatively less to lose,” the CEO of a private life insurance company had told Moneycontrol.Another life insurance CEO said that the current discussions were only preliminary in nature. ""The consultation is going on, nothing concrete has emerged so far. Insurers will put forth a proposal after the consultations are over,"" he said."

I see a slight upward bias from here in USD/INR,"" said Dhiraj Nim, forex strategist at ANZ.""The rupee could depreciate modestly, but over the longer horizon...a supportive balance of payments and the eventual softening in the dollar would pave the way for modest appreciation.""Fed policymakers have pushed back strongly against early interest rate cut bets, delaying a long-awaited turn in the dollar's dominance over other currencies.[EUR/POLL]The RBI is still widely expected to cut rates later this year, but at a much slower pace than the Fed, so relative rupee strength may linger.Expectations that growth in Asia's third-largest economy would remain the fastest among major economies may also provide further background support.Still, any gains in are likely to be limited with the RBI expected to continue using foreign exchange reserves, currently around $616.7 billion, to safeguard against volatility.The rupee was expected to gain more than 0.6% to 82.50 versus the dollar in six months and 0.8% to 82.40 in a year. Forecasts ranged between 79.00 and 84.50 for the 12 month horizon.India has attracted significant inflows to its bond markets from foreign investors in recent months, helped by JPMorgan's decision to add the debt to its indexes.""Inclusion in JPMorgan's GBI-EM index this year and lack of optimism on China suggest that portfolio flows into India should continue,"" noted Aditya Sharma, emerging markets strategist at Natwest Markets, referring to the government bond index for emerging markets.""Additionally, the RBI's FX interventions are focused on suppressing volatility from broader USD moves."""

Clegg did not describe the penalties.He added there was currently no viable mechanism to label written text generated by AI tools like ChatGPT.""That ship has sailed,"" Clegg said.A Meta spokesman declined to say whether the company would apply labels to generative AI content shared on its encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.Meta's independent oversight board on Monday rebuked the company's policy on misleadingly doctored videos, saying it was too narrow and the content should be labeled rather than removed.Clegg said he broadly agreed with those critiques.The board was right, he said, that Meta's existing policy ""is just simply not fit for purpose in an environment where you're going to have way more synthetic content and hybrid content than before.""He cited the new labeling partnership as evidence that Meta was already moving in the direction the board had proposed."

The broader market ended in the green with BSE SmallCap gaining 1.23 percent, BSE MidCap rising 1.06 percent and BSE 500 gaining 0.92 percent.Why it’s important: Markets would evaluate the central bank’s commentary on monetary policy, although the positive momentum is expected to continue amid heightened volatility.#2. Retail investors come of age in India, make most of recent market rallyRetail investors who put in money directly in stock have in recent times tended to sell at highs and buy at lower levels, a reversal of their past behavior. Gains booked by retail investors in the secondary market have outpaced gains made through the safer route of mutual funds. Direct retail investors in the current financial year have so far net sold shares worth Rs 1.68 lakh crore, coinciding with a broad-based rally.Why it’s important: Indian retail investors seem to have matured, timing their purchases and offloading largely in sync with market movements. Direct investments remain the riskier option though.#3. Reserve Bank may cancel license of Paytm Payments Bank or supersede its boardThe Reserve Bank of India is considering either cancelling the license of Paytm Payments Bank or superseding its board after the settlement of all pipeline transactions and nodal accounts are completed by March 15. The banking overseer has also said no deposit or credit transactions or topups will be allowed in any customer accounts, prepaid instruments, and wallets, etc. after February 29.Why it’s important: The newbie payments bank has been found to have violated several norms, including know your customer rules, which compelled the regulator to order the lender to stop banking transactions. There could be more trouble ahead for the payments bank.#4. Paytm founder meets finance minister, Enforcement Directorate to initiate investigationThe Enforcement Directorate is likely to start a formal probe into Paytm to investigate issues flagged in the reference from the Reserve Bank.

He had met top central bank official the preceding day.Why it’s important: Paytm is understood to have requested an extension to the February 29 deadline. It might not get what it wants if the financial crimes agency starts probing its business practices.#5. BharatPe slapped with fresh notice by corporate affairs ministry on operational issuesThe corporate affairs ministry has issued a fresh notice to BharatPe that seeks details from the digital payments company about its working and the proceedings it had begun against co-founder Ashneer Grover. The ministry has also queried about findings in a status report filed by the Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing, which investigated allegations of financial irregularities at the company.Why it’s important: The new notice to BharatPe comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of fintech firms over compliance and governance. Rival Paytm is also facing the music.#6. Top investors look at acquiring medical sutures maker Healthium MedtechTop investors such as General Atlantic, ChrysCapital and Carlyle are looking to buy medical sutures maker Healthium Medtech. The company owned by Apax Partners has appointed investment bank Jefferies to run the process. A deal may value the business at $750-850 million. The proposed selling of the company come after it did not go through a public issue.Why it’s important: There has been a lot of interest and deals in India’s healthcare segment that is seen expanding rapidly. Apax may not get the 3X return on investment it is seeking though.#7. FMCG firms in India brace for tough year ahead as consumption growth plateausIndia’s packaged consumer goods industry may face a tough year ahead after two years of robust growth led by higher prices. Makers of soaps to shampoos and biscuits to beverages may grow at just 4.5-6.5 percent in value terms this year, market researcher NielsenIQ said, sharply lower than 8.4 percent in 2022 and 9.3 percent in 2023.Why it’s important: There seems to be a definite slowdown in the FMCG sector, which is in line with the central government’s estimate of slower household consumption growth.#8. Finance ministry aims to transfer stressed assets worth Rs 1 lakh crore to bad bankThe Union finance ministry is pushing for a significant transfer of stressed assets amounting to Rs 1 lakh crore to the National Asset Reconstruction Company from state-owned lender by the end of March. The bad bank operates by acquiring non-performing assets from banks, paying 15 percent in cash and the remainder in government security receipts, which banks can invoke during resolution or liquidation.Why it’s important: The bad bank hasn’t exactly been an unqualified success as lenders were reluctant to engage with its terms, which has now required an intervention by the finance minister.#9. Market rally sees government collect Rs 25,000 crore in securities transaction taxIn a year when investors flooded into the stock market and benchmark indices regularly smashed records, the government earned 25 percent more from the tax on selling listed securities. The income-tax department netted Rs 25,000 crore in securities transaction tax till the end of January, compared with Rs 20,000 crore collected in the same period a year ago.Why it’s important: The sharp rise is in line with the 26 percent growth seen in personal income tax collection in the fiscal year till January 10 but way above the 8 percent expansion seen in corporate tax collection.#10. Start-ups missing in action at brisk hiring season in premier business schoolsIndia’s premier business schools have put placement jitters behind them with graduating batches being scooped up by recruiters in a year startups and fintechs have gone missing and the number of offers per recruiter has fallen. To make up for the gap, placement teams at Indian Institutes of Management have tapped more firms and insisted joining dates should remain unchanged.Why it’s important: Brisk hiring at the IIMs would be good news for management graduates. The same cannot be said of engineering colleges though as tech hiring as seen a sharp moderation."

Cognizant said discretionary spending by clients has still not picked up.The poor show, though expected, points towards the continuing overall weak demand environment for IT companies.Though a US-based company, Cognizant's performance reflects overall market sentiment for IT service companies in India such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro. These companies, in turn, have majority of their clients based in the US and Europe.While the company had guided for a decline of 4 to 1.2 percent for the quarter, its revenue fell 2.4 percent in constant currency terms. Sequentially, revenue decreased by 2.9 percent.The company's net profit increased by over 7 percent to $558 million YoY in the fourth quarter. The New Jersey-based company, whose employees are majorly based in India, follows calendar year.For the full year 2023, the IT major posted a 0.4 percent YoY decline in revenue at $19.4 billion. In constant currency terms, it was 0.3 percent lower.Cognizant has given a guidance of $4.68-$4.76 billion for Q1FY24, which translates to a decline of 2.7 percent to 1.2 percent.""Our guidance range is broader because we do not know what we do not know,"" Kumar said while addressing analysts after declaring the results. ""But our thesis is very simple, we are going to be prepared for a comeback of discretionary,"" Kumar added.For 2024, the company has guided for a revenue of $19-$19.8 billion, which translates to a decline of 1.8 percent to a growth of 2.2 percent. Last year, while reporting its Q4 earnings, Cognizant did not provide a full year guidance. For 2022, the company had pegged the full year guidance at $20-20.5 billion.Despite acquisitions contributing to about $200 million to topline, Cognizant provided an anaemic guidance.CEO Ravi Kumar S, who has been at the helm for a year, said the company delivered its Q4 revenue within the guided range, maintaining its commercial momentum.“If you dissect our guidance, you would see that there is a certain sequential growth that we have assumed during the course of the year. But environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly a slower start to the year,” Jatin Dalal, the new chief financial officer said.The IT major’s adjusted operating margin rose 190 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 16.1 percent.Bookings for the quarter stood at a record $26.3 billion on a trailing-twelve-month basis, up 9 percent year-on-year.Kumar explained that the proportion of large deals was lower in 2022 compared to 2023. ""Now that we're entering 2024, what we won in 2023 will contribute to 2024, it did contribute to 2023, but it will contribute more in 2024 and it will create a backlog for the future,"" Kumar said.Vertical playRevenue from the financial services vertical decreased by 5.8 percent to $1.395 billion. This is the first time in 30 years of Cognizant’s history when revenue from the financial services vertical is trailing the health sciences business.Revenue from the health sciences vertical declined by 2.1 percent YoY to $1.396 billion in the fourth quarter. This is not because health sciences division grew faster, but because the financial services shrank faster by 6% YoY and the health sciences division shrinking by 2% in the same period.During 2023, three leaders from the Financial Services vertical quit the company. Meera Krishnamurthy, who was the head of banking and financial services, was one amongst the several big-wigs who exited the company.Kumar said the financial services vertical churns out a higher number of discretionary deals. And because the sector carries the burden of high interest rates, it is leading clients to a wait-and-watch scenario, thereby pausing discretionary work.""Let's see how the industry (financial services) shapes up in the year. And normally what I have seen based on the experience is, if there are one or two repeatable cycles of interest rate adjustments downwards, we will start to see the spend coming back,"" Kumar said.Revenue from the Products and Resources vertical increased by 3.1 percent to $1.2 billion for the quarter under consideration.Employee metricsThe company saw its headcount increase by 1,100 sequentially, ending with 347,700 employees in 2023. Attrition fell by 11.8 percentage points to 13.8 percent on a trailing twelve-month basis.Back in India, IT services companies have seen a steady decline in headcount. India’s top three IT companies have reported a reduction of 16,254 employees cumulatively in the third quarter of FY24, amid an uncertain demand environment.In Q1, Cognizant kicked off a cost-cutting programme called NextGen, as part of which it planned to cut 3,500 jobs as well as give up 11 million sq ft in office space primarily in large Indian cities and moving to smaller cities — incurring a cost of $350 million as part of this ($150 million in employee separation costs and $200 million in facility exit and other costs).In 2023, it has so far incurred $229 million, consisting of $115 million in employee separation costs, $108 million in facility exit costs, and $6 million in third-party and other costs.Generative AIThe company said 88,000 of its employees have completed artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI courses.Cognizant currently has over 250 early engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI, and another 350 are in the pipeline. ""We aim to infuse AI, not only into our core offerings but into everything we do, including using generative AI to create industry and functional services,"" Kumar said.Although, consumer use of generative AI is starting to explore, enterprise use cases have been ramping slowly, Kumar told analysts. However, the company expects the pace of enterprise adoption to pick up soon, and after a slow takeoff, the movement of the curve will be accelerate sharply, he said.""Our research also predicts that 90% of the jobs will be disrupted in some way by this technology,"" Kumar said.From 2023-2032, the percent of jobs with high exposure scores, meaning the degree to which an occupation will be affected by generative AI could increase from 8% to 52%, he further said. Setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work, productivity and economic growth."

The Reserve Bank of India has restricted Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and doing credit transactions after February 29.Paytm’s fortunes have significantly changed in the last one week. According to Bloomberg data, One 97 Communications stock had 9 ‘buy’ calls and 5 ‘hold’ calls on January 30, with consensus target price of Rs 960.

He warned them not to have another ‘Yes Bank scenario’.It could be considered as an investment choice for sophisticated investors who can track the communications coming out of both the RBI and PayTM and understand, interpret and infer appropriately from those communications, he said.If Paytm could successfully migrate the wallet business to other banks, it could keep most of the wallet customers without huge customer loss and it won’t have a long-term impact on the company, according to Gupta.Paytm outlook uncertain; valuation attractive, but things could get worse tooBut, what about investors who already own Paytm stock? “People who already have Paytm in their portfolio need not panic and book loss now, because it is trading at juicy valuations, assuming that the overall business comes back to the original levels, albeit in partnership with other banks,” he explained.Gupta added that things could get even worse for Paytm. It could be suitable only for investors who put a limited proportion of their portfolio into the stock, and who have a good risk appetite.Meanwhile, Bernstein has given an outperform call on Paytm with target price of Rs 600 as they expect the company to “successfully execute operational changes required to overcome restrictions”.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

However, the scope of motor insurance is much wider. Yet awareness remains low about the kind of comprehensive coverage it offers.It goes beyond the basic coverage of third-party liability, encompassing damages arising out of not only accidents but also theft, natural disasters, and more. Not just that, comprehensive coverage not only refers to own damage cover but also the option of adding suitable add-ons to address any specific needs.Let's delve into the significance of these add-ons and how they contribute to enhancing overall coverage.Also read: EV insurance covers to gain on budget push to battery making, charging infraRound-the-clock roadside assistance coverageThis add-on feature offered in motor insurance policies provides round-the-clock support to policyholders in the event of vehicle breakdowns, a flat tyre, engine failure, an empty fuel tank, or any other situation that renders the vehicle immobile. It offers towing services, on-site repairs, emergency fuel and adjustments, and any other assistance to address operational issues.Engine protection coverThis add-on covers the policyholder for the cost of the damages to the engine that occur due to engine malfunction, lubricating oil leakage, ingress of water, hydrostatic lock, etc. The engine is the most important and expensive part of a vehicle, and any damage to it can result in significant repair costs.Even those with their own damage cover may be forced to bear the cost of repairs on their own in the event of engine damage. For vehicle owners living in areas prone to flooding or waterlogging, this is a valuable and essential addition to motor insurance.Also read: How to file insurance claims for your flood-damaged carZero-depreciation coverDepreciation occurs due to a gradual reduction in the vehicle's value over time due to factors such as the age of the car and wear and tear. Since all vehicles are subject to depreciation, standard motor insurance coverage determines the total amount payable during a claim by calculating and applying the standard depreciation rate as prescribed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).However, with a zero-depreciation cover, commonly known as a bumper-to-bumper cover or nil-depreciation cover, the policyholder can get the full value of the vehicle without factoring in depreciation. In fact, due to the absence of deductions, the customer can save significantly on claim costs. For example, in the case of a five-year-old vehicle, insurance companies apply a 50 percent depreciation rate.Assuming an average claim falls within the range of Rs 30,000-40,000, the insurance company will cover only half of this amount. The remaining Rs 15,000-20,000 will need to be covered by the customers who did not choose to add this coverage at the time of purchasing the policy.Thus, customers can minimise the financial impact of rapid depreciation. In addition, new drivers or those living in accident-prone areas may also find this coverage beneficial. However, even existing policyholders have lately been opting for this coverage.While the benefits are significant, it's important to note that zero-depreciation cover usually comes with a higher premium than standard policies. Yet, for many policyholders, this expense is justifiable due to the cost-efficiency it brings during claim settlements, mainly because it negates the depreciation value of the vehicle. It is essential to be aware of certain limitations associated with this cover. Some insurance companies provide zero-depreciation coverage up to specific vehicle ages — ranging from up to five years and up to 10 years for older vehicles.Consumables coverThis add-on feature provides additional protection by covering the expenses incurred on consumable items used during vehicle repairs. This specifically caters to costs related to materials such as nuts, bolts, screws, engine oil, lubricants, and other essential items. While standard motor insurance policies typically cover repairing damaged parts, they may exclude these consumables, leaving policyholders with having to pay for out-of-pocket expenses.Return to invoice coverThis add-on comes to the policyholder’s rescue if the vehicle is stolen or suffers a total loss. Under a regular comprehensive policy, one is eligible to receive compensation up to the Insured Declared Value (IDV). However, with this add-on, one can get full compensation up to the last invoice amount of the vehicle.This translates to significant savings as the IDV gets depreciated, and it doesn’t factor in the road tax registration and other costs that are borne by the policyholder at the time of purchase.In conclusion, opting for add-on features in your motor insurance policy is a strategic decision that significantly enhances the overall value of your coverage. These supplementary features address the specific needs and potential gaps that may arise during unforeseen circumstances.(The author is the head, motor insurance at Policybazaar.com)"
474,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/why-pre-paying-your-housing-loans-early-makes-good-financial-sense-12206641.html,Why pre-paying your housing loans early makes good financial sense,"February 07, 2024 09:15 AM IST",An increase of 5-10% in your annual EMI is enough to bring down your home loan interest costs by half. But pre-paying your home loan isn’t just about savings.,"In the initial years of a home loan, the interest component in equated monthly instalments (EMI) is larger, which gradually decreases as time goes on. Financial advisors recommend prepaying the home loan earlier as the money you prepay goes straight towards reducing the home loan principal and cutting the total interest cost.Now, home loan rates are around 9 percent for many. So, borrowers are feeling the heat from increased costs.The decision to prepay your home loan should be a well thought one. We will discuss here with an example the best time to do so and explain a couple of strategies to prepay the home loan.Home loan repaymentAssume you have a home loan of Rs 75 lakh for 25 years at a 9 percent rate of interest. You will be paying an EMI of Rs 62,940 per month. During the term of 25 years, you will repay the principal of Rs 75 lakh plus interest of Rs 1.14 crore. It means if you keep your loan outstanding for the entire 25-year tenure you will end up paying at least double the loan amount (refer to graphic).Interest component is high in the initial yearsIn the initial years of loan repayment, a major part of your EMI goes towards interest, while a small part goes towards principal repayment.Have a look at the annual loan amortisation schedule for your loan of Rs 75 lakh, 25 years tenure and 9 percent interest rate (refer to graphic).In the first year, 89 percent of EMIs go towards interest servicing and 11 percent of the Rs 7.55 lakh annual EMI (12 x Rs 62,940) goes towards principal repayment. In the 10th year, the interest component reduces to 75 percent and further down in the 15th and 20th year, it’s down to 61 percent and 39 percent, respectively.So, every month, the interest component in the EMI decreases a bit while the principal repayment part rises. Here, the monthly EMI still remains the same.“The bulk of EMI in the initial years is for interest servicing. And it is for this very reason that you should consider prepaying the home loan during the initial years,” says Dev Ashish, founder of StableInvestor.com.Here are a couple of home loan pre-payment strategies:Use your bonus well. Pay an extra EMI every yearHere, instead of 12 EMIs of Rs 62,940 every year, you should pay 13 EMIs of this amount. This pre-payment strategy will bring down your tenure from 25 years to about 19-20 years. You will also end up saving around Rs 32 lakh in interest costs.“Every year you might get some bonus/incentives from your employer. So, a part of that surplus can be used to make at least one extra EMI payment,” says Ashish. He adds that if making one full additional EMI payment is difficult, then just paying Rs 5,000 extra EMI per month will have a similar impact.In addition to annual bonuses and surpluses, you can also liquidate low yielding investments such as traditional endowment policies that fetch 5-6 percent annual returns over the long term or even fixed deposits. Do not withdraw from your Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and National Pension Scheme (NPS) corpus for home loan prepayment. “Doing so could set your retirement planning back by years,” says Adhil Shetty, CEO, Bankbazaar.com.Increasing EMI by 5-10 percent every yearAnother option is to increase your EMI, in line with your annual increments, and direct surpluses towards the home loan. Many borrowers successfully pre-pay their loans with tenures of over 25 years within 10-12 years.So, as your yearly income grows, your monthly EMI for a home loan should also be increased. Say in this example, if you increase your EMI by just 5 percent, your 25-year loan gets over in just 13 years. You will end up saving around Rs 52 lakh in interest costs by just increasing the EMI by 5 percent every year (refer to graphic).“Five percent is not too big a payment and better than not prepaying at all. It allows you to prepay slowly and leaves you money to invest for goals such as saving for retirement and educating your children,” says Shetty.And if you increase the EMIs by 7.5 percent and 10 percent every year, then your loan gets over in 12 years and 10 years, respectively. Here, you will save Rs 60 lakh and Rs 65 lakh by increasing the EMI by 7.5 percent and 10 percent every year respectively.Avoid using emergency fund for loan prepaymentEmergency funds should be used during job loss and medical emergencies in the family.“Using emergency funds for making prepayments can force borrowers to avail loans at higher interest rates or redeem other investments at suboptimal prices for meeting unforeseen expenses during periods of unemployment,” says Ratan Chaudhary, Head of Home Loans, Paisabazaar.Do not redeem investments meant for crucial financial goalsJust because it is beneficial to prepay your home loans, it doesn’t mean you sell your investments to generate the cash. If your equity mutual funds earn you, say 12 percent compounded returns over a period of time, and your loan runs at 8 percent, it doesn’t make sense to sell a high yielding asset to pay off an 8 percent loan.Besides, investments are — and should be — earmarked for long-term goals. Any premature withdrawals from your investments would make it harder for you to reach your financial goals. “And it may also force you to borrow costlier loans to achieve your crucial financial goals,” Chaudhary warns."

It also said that the festival season-led demand was weaker than expected in the same period. However, the urban demand has remained resilient in the October-December quarter, and has shown signs of improvement, said the brokerage firm.After increasing prices over the last couple of quarters, the FMCG sector likely took a pause in Q3FY24, and even price cuts in a few cases, said Yes Securities. FMCG companies took price cuts in order to pass on the benefit of lower commodity inflation to consumers and compete with smaller regional players.The brokerage firm also said that with comfortable gross margins levels and a weak pick up in demand, companies will maintain the high intensity of advertising spends in the October-to-December quarter as well.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Sitharaman said that ""devolution to states happens as per the Finance Commission recommendation"" and that the Union government has no ""discretion"" in the allocation of tax revenues.The discussion over lower devolutions to states, especially due to the Centre’s higher reliance on cesses is not new. But with general elections slated in April, May 2024, the renewed intensity of this debate is significant.At the heart of the devolution dispute seemingly lie two major issues. First, the devolution given to states has been significantly lower in the last few years compared to the recommended levels of the 15th Finance Commission.Second, the share of devolution for the less populous and fiscally stronger southern states tends to be lower, while few northern states, which are weaker on these metrics, get a larger share of central taxes.The issueTax devolution refers to the distribution of net proceeds of Union taxes and duties by the Centre to the states, which help them to carry out spending on development, welfare and priority-sector projects and schemes. At present, as per the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission, 41 percent of the divisible tax pool of the Centre is transferred to states in 14 instalments annually covering the five-year period of 2021-22 to 2025-26.India Ratings and Research on February 6 in a note said that tax devolution given to states has been significantly lagging compared to the recommended levels of the 15th Finance Commission.In FY25, the Union government has budgeted to share 35.5 percent of the divisible tax pool (gross tax revenues net of cess and surcharges (excluding GST compensation cess) and taxes of Union territories) with states, lower than the suggested 41 percent. Furthermore, the states’ share in central taxes has been trending downwards, averaging 35.4 percent of the divisible pool during FY21-FY25BE, down from 39.8 percent during FY16-FY20, the note added.The Reserve Bank of India in its latest edition of State Finances: A Study of Budgets of 2023-24 released on December 11, 2023, highlighted the same. “Due to increase in cesses and surcharges, the divisible pool has shrunk from 88.6 percent of gross tax revenue in 2011-12 to 78.9 percent in 2021-22 despite the 10-percentage point increase in tax devolution recommended by the 15th finance panel.”The central bank suggested that since the actual tax devolution hinges critically on the cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the states need to augment their own fiscal capacity and reduce dependence on transfers.“Over the years, the share of central taxes shared with states as a percentage of the divisible pool has been hovering around 35-36 percent in the last four years. One of the reasons for that is cess and surcharges are more than 10 percent of the gross tax revenue. So, it is reducing the overall pie. And, out of that overall pie a lower share is going to the states, which is why some states are asking the Centre to share more revenues,” India Ratings’ chief economist Devendra Pant told Moneycontrol.North Vs SouthConcerns were raised by southern states even before 2020, when the 15th Finance Commission submitted its report using the 2011 population census to decide the devolution of taxes from the central government to the states, with a separate factor to reward some for controlling their population.This was a shift from the previous commission, which used a combination of the 1971 and 2011 censuses as macro-indicators in the equalisation formula, with a much higher weight being given to the former. This was done to reward states that have effectively controlled population growth.The NK Singh-led Commission's pivot to the 2011 census entirely, as one of the criteria for deciding the pattern of devolution, was done to be more responsive to existing population levels.This means that higher the population of a state as per the latest census, the higher the amount of funds it will get from the central government for its spending needs. Therefore, the less populous states in India stand to lose from the divisible pool of revenues.This is where the North, South divide debate makes an entry. North Indian states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar whose populations have expanded rapidly since 1971 naturally get a relatively larger share of funds thanks to the shift by the erstwhile 15th finance panel.Take for example, the population of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which grew at the rate of over 20 percent in the period between 2001 and 2011, while the southern state of Karnataka saw an increase of 15.60 percent during the same period.The situation would be different if the Finance Commissions still used part of the 1971 census as a criterion since both these states had a lower gap in the rate of increase in population with Uttar Pradesh seeing a rise of over 25 percent between 1971-1981 while Karnataka witnessing an increase of over 26 percent.The story runs the same if you compare another southern state with a counterpart in the North. Tamil Nadu’s population grew by over 15 percent between 2001 and 2011, whereas Bihar saw a much larger increase of over 25 percent.The statement showing the state-wise distribution of net proceeds of Union taxes and duties as per the Budget estimates for 2024-25 seemingly makes the impact of this divergence in population apparent. All five Southern states – Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Kerala will be getting 15.8 percent as a share of the total allocated amount for devolution for the next fiscal, while the northern states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh alone account for nearly 28 percent.Though the specific details of this proposal are not available yet, one must separately note that in the Budget for 2024-25, the Centre announced the move to form a high-powered committee for ""an extensive consideration of the challenges arising from fast population growth and demographic changes"". It is not known if this would have an impact on the metrics used by finance commissions.What makes matters even more complicated is that as admitted by the 15th Finance Commission in its report, most of the lower per capita income states are also more populous.Therefore, many of the southern states that perform better on this metric would get a lower share compared to states with lower per capita income. This is a result of the income distance criteria, another metric used by the Finance Commission to decide on the pattern of devolution among states.Weighing in on the debate, Congress leader Praveen Chakravarty raised the issue of double counting. “The farther the state is from the prosperity of the national average, the greater they get in devolutions. So, Bihar, which is the farthest from the national average, will get a lot more than, say, Kerala. But there is an issue of double counting here since if a state is distant from the national average in prosperity then it usually has a higher population as well as a lower human development index,” he said.According to India Ratings’ Pant, since two of the indicators deciding the sharing pattern are population and the development parameter of a state compared to the national average, the states that rank higher on population and lower on development would predominantly get a larger share in devolutions.This has led to allegations by some southern states over the past few years that by getting a smaller share of tax revenues, they are getting penalised rather than being rewarded for effectively controlling population.In the current financial year, the central government has released Rs 8.20 lakh crore of shareable proceeds in 12 instalments (including two advance instalments) to the states till January 2024 against the Budget target of Rs 10.21 lakh crore, which has now been increased to Rs 11.04 lakh crore as per revised projections for FY24. For the next fiscal, the devolution of states’ share has been enhanced to Rs 12.20 lakh crore, which is 3.7 percent of the GDP.Southern rallyNot just Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have also raised concerns over the shrinking share in devolution from central taxes.In his speech for Budget 2024-25, Kerala Finance Minister KN Balagopal pointed out that despite the likelihood that their own tax revenues will almost double the figures of 2020-21 by the end of the next fiscal, the state is facing a financial crisis given the dip in the share from central revenues.“Our total tax revenue includes Kerala’s eligible tax share from the tax collected by the Centre. As per (RBI) statistics of 2021-23…the Centre will provide Rs 35 for every Rs 65 collected by the respective states. But the Centre provides only Rs 21 against Kerala’s own tax collection of every Rs 79. That is, only Rs 21 out of Rs 100, which is the Centre’s contribution. Uttar Pradesh gets Rs 46 out of Rs 100 from the Centre. Bihar gets Rs 70 out of Rs 100. Do we need any other better proof than the statistics of RBI?” Balagopal said.Tamil Nadu’s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) government has also claimed that the state has been receiving a lower share from central levies. Finance minister Thangam Thennarasu last month reportedly explained that the state received only 29 paise for every rupee it gave to the Centre, adding that while Tamil Nadu accounted for 6.1 percent of the country’s population, its share in the pool of taxes had reduced from 5.30 percent under 12th Finance Commission to 4.07 percent in the 15th Finance Commission.Chakravarty says that the argument of the Southern states is that “their share of giving keeps growing but they have not seen good use of those funds in the northern states. So, at what point will it end, because the whole point is to bridge the gap"".What adds to the misery of states is the nature of the goods and services tax (GST). Some states have alleged that the control they have over their own revenues has been reducing, with the rollout of the GST in July 2017 further lowering their ability to tinker with tax rates and increase revenues.“Absolutely, GST exacerbates the problems. GST has certainly made the southern states that much more unwanted in the fiscal plan of India,” Chakravarty adds.The way forwardAnother school of thought, however, says that the Centre has little role to play in this, given that the Finance Commission is an independent entity.“This demand has been coming for a while, so the 16th Finance Commission may look into it, but the outcome is difficult to gauge. Whatever the Finance Commission has recommended in the past, the Union government has accepted, including the increase in the percentage of devolution,” Pant said.The ball therefore clearly lies in the court of the newly constituted 16th Finance Commission.“Since states are responsible for over 60 percent of general government expenditure, lower than the recommended share of states in central taxes coupled with cess and surcharges will remain an important issue before the 16th Finance Commission,” according to Paras Jasrai, Senior Analyst, India Ratings.Arvind Panagariya, the former vice-chairman of NITI Aayog and now the chairman of the 16th Finance Commission, has a tough task ahead as he steers the panel that will decide the new formula for sharing of tax revenues between the Centre and states for a period of five years starting April 1, 2026."

Sumit Binani- the resolution professional appointed for the KSK Mahanadi power project by the insolvency court - did not respond immediately to queries sent by Reuters.The unsolicited bid shows Indian private companies' renewed interest in coal-based power plants.The share of private investment in India's coal-based power dwindled after 2018 due to lower demand and an ambitious thrust by the federal government on renewable energy. However, coal-based power plants are back in focus as India expects demand to cross 260-gigawatts during peak hours in summer this year.India will operate new coal-fired power plants with a combined capacity of 13.9 gigawatts until December this year, the highest annual increase in at least six years."

For policymakers, it’s important to stabilize the stock market to avoid further hurting consumer confidence as China enters the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.“The news that the nation’s number one is holding a meeting is an encouraging development as it shows that the plunge is getting close to punching through the authorities’ comfort level,” said Li Weiqing, fund manager at JH Investment Management Co. “It gives me the impression that they are doing everything they can, apart from calling out to the market — now is the time to buy.”The report on the Xi meeting followed a flurry of supportive announcements earlier in the day, including a vow by Central Huijin Investment Ltd., the unit that holds Chinese government stakes in big financial institutions, to buy more exchange-traded funds. Every effort will be made to maintain stable market operations, the securities watchdog said in a follow-up comment.Foreign inflows surged as overseas funds added more than 12 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) of mainland shares on Tuesday, the most this year.Chinese stocks that are listed in the US rallied on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index jumped as much as 4.8%, with major internet stocks including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and PDD Holdings Inc. rising at least 2%. This came after a gauge of tech shares listed in Hong Kong staged its briskest rally since December 2022.One risk for buyers is that the outcome of the meeting fails to impress, triggering a renewed selloff. The battered market has seen multiple false dawns over the past year, with stimulus-fueled rebounds barely lasting more than a few days as poor economic data and new policy surprises hurt sentiment.The equity crash in 2015 suggests any rescue attempt may not turn around the market immediately. Authorities curbed speculative trading, targeted market manipulation and guided some investors to avoid stock sales back then. Yet stocks took months to eventually bottom out, and peaked at a much lower level than the 2015 high.“Our view has been that state support can indeed lead to a tactical rebound but we are not sure if that can be enough for a sustained rally,” said Rajat Agarwal, Asia equity strategist at Societe Generale SA. “Even if we see 2015, the buying started in the summer but the rebound didn’t last and the market only bottomed out in early 2016.”As the slump extends, Xi has shown signs of becoming increasingly involved in the nation’s financial and economy policies, including making an unprecedented visit to the central bank late last year.Authorities have been working around the clock over the past few months to come up with market rescue measures, the people said. The securities regulator has worked weekends and the National Financial Regulatory Administration has called at least a dozen meetings over the past two months on stabilizing capital markets.The CSRC and NFRA didn’t immediately respond to Bloomberg requests for comment.Officials this week tightened trading restrictions, banning some quantitative hedge funds from placing sell orders and others from cutting stock positions in their leveraged market-neutral funds, in an effort to stem losses. The securities regulator also said Monday it will guide brokerages to adjust their margin call levels and maintain “flexible” liquidation lines to limit forced selling.Earlier efforts have included curbs on short-selling as well as state buying of shares in the nation’s largest banks. The measures have shown little success in restoring investor confidence, which has been hurt in recent years by an economic slowdown as well as Xi’s growing control over private enterprise and sweeping crackdowns.Even with this week’s rebound, equity benchmarks are still among this year’s worst performers among more than 90 global gauges tracked by Bloomberg. The CSI 300 tumbled to a five-year low on Friday and was still down more than 40% from a peak in 2021.“The fact that a special meeting may have been called could indicate that things have become so bad that it needs to be reported to the top,” said Xu Dawei, fund manager at Jintong Private Fund Management in Beijing. “If there were to be a report from the state media on this, I would say with confidence that this is the pivot point, as concerted actions are also now seen.”"

Puri said currently, the world is facing multiple crises, energy availability is one among them.The oil minister said IEW has become a prominent energy event in a year. “In just a year, the energy India energy week has become a prominent take on the global energy calendar,” said Puri.Puri noted that other global initiatives by India, such as the International Solar Alliance and the Global Biofuels Alliance, have also been a success for the country.The minister also praised the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ensuring low petrol and diesel prices in India. “We were able under your leadership to ensure that prices of petrol and diesel in India were, in fact, amongst the lowest in the world,” said Puri.Speaking at the inauguration, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said IEW 2024 presents a unique opportunity for Goa to showcase its potential in the energy sector.“My commitment is to create a pool of skilled workforce to the various efforts towards the skilling, rescaling and upskilling to cater to the various emerging sectors in the state,” said Sawant.The minister applauded the government’s efforts for removing obstacles of investment and incentivizing the oil and gas sector.Sawant also said India is actively transitioning towards renewable energy sources, aiming for 100 percent electric vehicles (EVs) adoption by 2027. “We are leading the way in electric vehicle adoption aiming for 100% EV penetration by 2027.

The company’s shares dropped as much as 4% as of 12:25 p.m. Tuesday in London. The stock has slumped 54% since the end of July.Stroll, 64, tapped Felisa to be CEO in May 2022, replacing former Mercedes-AMG boss Tobias Moers, who spent less than two years in the job. His predecessor, Andy Palmer, left months after Stroll rescued Aston Martin in early 2020.Aston Martin’s search is no surprise given that Felisa — who initially retired from Ferrari NV in 2016 — was “always a temporary solution,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Dean said in a report.The carmaker synonymous with James Bond has repeatedly needed to raise more capital since Stroll took over as the largest shareholder four years ago. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and EV maker Lucid Group Inc. have taken stakes in the UK company since mid-2022.Aston Martin warned in November that it expected to ship fewer vehicles than previously forecast for the full year, after supply-chain issues hampered the rollout of its new DB12 sports car.Felisa was on Aston Martin’s board when Stroll needed a chief executive to replace Moers, who left in the midst of the company’s troubles launching the £2.4 million ($3 million) Valkyrie supercar. Felisa spent 26 years at Ferrari and was CEO in his last eight years with the company, ending in 2016.While Stroll has steadied Aston Martin to a degree, the Canadian billionaire acknowledged last year that he didn’t know what he was getting into when he threw the company a lifeline around the start of the global pandemic. He’s set targets for the manufacturer to generate £2.5 billion of revenue and £800 million in adjusted earnings by 2028, both well short of what Ferrari brings in annually.Aston Martin’s next CEO faces the challenge of executing the transition to electric vehicles while launching two new front-engine sports cars, a new Valhalla supercar and a revamped DBX sport utility vehicle, BI’s Dean wrote. The carmaker forged ties with Lucid last year to source components from the EV maker in exchange for shares and cash.Stroll capitalized on growing investor interest in Formula One racing late last year by selling a minority stake in Aston Martin’s team — which is separate from the listed car company — to US private equity firm Arctos Partners at a valuation of about £1 billion."

Net income fell to $902.5 million in 2023 from $1.82 billion in the previous year, SMIC said.Through 2023, capital expenditure stood at $7.47 billion yuan. That compares with $6.35 billion for 2022, representing a 17.6% increase on the year.It expects capital expenditure to be roughly flat this year compared with the previous year, it added.The semiconductor industry entered a slump in recent years after a pandemic-driven shortage of chips turned into a glut as the economy slowed and demand for these products fell.But there are signs that the industry may recover in the coming year due to increased demand for products that use semiconductors, such as smartphones and other consumer electronics.SMIC expects a gross margin of between 9-11% in the first quarter of this year, compared with 16.4% in the fourth quarterof 2023.The company entered the international spotlight last year when analysts said that the company had assisted Huawei in developing one of the most advanced chips ever manufactured domestically in China. This chip was used in Huawei's Mate 60 smartphone series released last August."

The segment accounted for 31.7 percent of the company's overall Q3 revenues.The Kiddopia business saw its revenue decline by 4.2 percent to Rs 54.7 crore for the quarter.

Higher loyalty promotion expenses also resulted in lower net revenue, the company said.The added GST cost resulted in the company posting a loss of Rs 2.5 crore for the quarter, as compared to Rs 3.3 crore profit in the year-ago period.Nazara's adtech business saw a 44 percent decline in its revenues to Rs 26.1 crore for the quarter, from Rs 46.6 crore.

Businesses replied that CPI inflation may end 2024 at 4.96 percent, 23 basis points higher than their prediction of 4.73 percent in October 2023.One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.Also Read: Revenue Secretary Malhotra sees no reason to cut fuel excise""Overall, the firms are expecting increasing cost pressures,"" Abhiman Das, professor of economics at IIM-A, who conducts the survey, said.As per the results of the survey, one-third of the firms polled think costs have increased significantly - or by more than 6 percent - up from 29 percent in the previous round of the survey. At the same time, the fraction of firms reporting 'moderate cost increase' - or 3.1 percent to 6.0 percent - remained around 29 percent. IIM-Ahmedabad's Business Inflation Expectations SurveyThe results of the survey - which has become an important input in monetary policy decisions - comes just ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) interest rate decision. The Indian central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) began its three-day meeting on February 6 and will announce its interest rate decision at 10am on February 8. The rate-setting panel is largely expected to maintain the policy repo rate at 6.5 percent for the sixth meeting in a row.The BIES largely polls manufacturing firms. The latest round of the survey, the 80th in the series, is based on responses mostly received in the second half of January.The rise in inflation expectations of firms comes amid prices rising at a quicker pace. In December, headline retail inflation rose to a four-month high of 5.69 percent, although the increase was less than expectations of 5.9 percent. Meanwhile, Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation - which businesses face - rose to a nine-month high of 0.73 percent in December.Unlike CPI inflation, WPI inflation was subdued for much of 2023, only rising above zero in November. It is expected to rise further in the coming months.Retail and wholesale inflation data for January is set to be released on February 12 and February 14, respectively. As per the RBI's latest forecast, CPI inflation is seen falling to 4 percent in July-September 2024 before rising to 4.7 percent in October-December 2024.Inflation expectations are keenly eyed by policymakers, as anchoring them is critical to ensuring price stability. On December 8, the MPC said monetary policy ""must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and fuller transmission"".The IIM-A survey is one of only two surveys conducted in India to measure inflation expectations. The other is the RBI's Inflation Expectations Survey of Households. The latest round of the survey, released on December 8, showed that while three-month-ahead inflation expectations of households were steady in November 2023 at 9.1 percent, the one-year-ahead expectations were up 20 basis points at 10.1 percent.While cost pressures have risen for manufacturing firms, sales expectations have also improved significantly, with about 57 percent of surveyed firms reporting 'normal' or greater sales in December 2023, up from 46 percent in November 2023.""Overall, the profit margins expectations have also improved. Around 48 percent of the firms in December 2023 are reporting profit margins to be 'about normal' or greater – significantly up from 43 percent reported in November 2023,"" Abhiman Das added.The survey measures 'normal' as the average of the preceding three years, excluding the Covid-19 period."

Both said they would go ahead with their respective semiconductor business ventures with new partners. Since then, there have been reports that the plan may get shelved, which Vedanta has denied.“It is not a child's play. We are doing the semiconductor project. We are there. We are submitting, we are talking. We are working on it,” Agarwal said in response to media reports that the company has not submitted a final plan to the government for approval.On February 5, Business Standard reported, quoting the minister of state for electronics and information technology, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, that the government is not looking at Vedanta’s plans as serious proposals in the absence of a technology partner and a new proposal.“We are working on two projects–one is the (display) glass and one is your semiconductor. We have submitted everything,” Agarwal said, as he spoke to Moneycontrol on the sidelines of India Energy Week (IEW) in Goa.The group led by Agarwal had entered the semiconductor and display glass business venture through Twin Star Technologies Limited (TSTL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Volcan Investments Limited, the ultimate holding company of the Indian listed entity Vedanta Ltd and part of the promoter group. The joint venture with Foxconn was under this entity. Both partners did not have experience but planned to rope in a technology partner.The Vedanta group’s decision to move the ownership of its new ventures from the promoter group entity to the India-listed company was seen as the immediate trigger while many industry players argue that it was a long time coming.“Leave aside Vedanta, India has to produce semiconductors. If India does not produce semiconductors, how do we grow? How do we compete with the first world?” he said.Separately, Foxconn too has maintained that it will take its plan ahead to set up a fab plant in India.The government had launched the Semicon India Programme in December 2021 with an outlay of Rs 76,000 crore for the development of semiconductors and display manufacturing ecosystem in India.Under the programme, fiscal incentive of 50 percent of the project cost is available to companies/consortia/ joint ventures for setting up of semiconductor fabs in India of any node size (including mature nodes). Similarly, a fiscal incentive of 50 percent of the project cost is available for setting up of display fabs of specified technologies in India.The application window for the scheme is open till December 2024.Application window of a separate Rs 1,100 crore Design Linked Incentive Scheme (for design of chips) is also open till December 2024. Dozens of applications have been received under DLI Scheme and several applications have been granted approval."

What caused precipitous selling was the call by some brokers for additional margins, not just for Paytm stock they were holding but also other outstanding positions","Coming on the heels of the high margin requirements for trades ahead of the budget, brokers’ call for additional collateral following the Paytm rout may have exaggerated the fall in the stock, traders and brokers Moneycontrol spoke to said.The Paytm stock has been in free fall for the past three days losing more than 42 percent in value before recovering 3 percent. The stock ended at Rs 452.80 on February 6. Since February 1, the stock has lost close to 40 percent on concerns over loss of business because of RBI curbs.Sources suggested that the margin funding book for the Paytm stock on NSE stood at close to Rs 250 crore to Rs 300 crore before the carnage started. What caused precipitous selling was the call by some brokers for additional margins, not just for the Paytm stock they were holding but also their other outstanding positions.Not exploring legal options, says Paytm Payments BankThis unexpected demand came on account of two reasons. A number of brokers decided to maintain high margins ahead of the Interim Budget anticipating higher volatility. With Paytm stock plunging, there was fear of a wider market rout with uncertainties around global cues as well. While some of them reduced the margin requirement post-budget to ‘normal’ levels, others continued with higher margins. ""This could have also helped offset some losses caused by Paytm margin calls,"" sources said.HDFC Securities's Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Dhiraj Relli confirmed to Moneycontrol that they are in a comfortable position as the clients they reached out to promptly paid up extra collateral for Paytm.The executive of a tech-based discount broking firm, who did not wished to be named, also said that clients were asked to either give margin or unwind position as part of regular risk management policies.5X jump in Paytm employees looking for jobs, ‘safe pastures’For clients who were not able to cough up extra margin, the position would have either been squared off or collateral was sold, said Trivesh D, Chief Operating Officer of Tradejini, a Bengaluru-based broking firm.What is Margin Trading Facility?MTF is similar to a BNPL or Buy Now Pay Later kind of arrangement where investors borrow funds from their brokers to purchase stocks. Not all brokers offer this feature.For instance, a client pays only Rs 25 but is able to buy stocks worth Rs 100. It is a product for the cash segment, and brokers charge anywhere between 7 percent to 21 percent on the borrowed funds.While the norm is 25-30 percent, brokers Moneycontrol spoke to said that every stock has a different margin requirement and companies keep tweaking the number based on volatility."
540,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/parliament-panel-recommends-below-18-gst-on-health-insurance-microinsurance-12206041.html,"Parliament panel recommends below 18% GST on health insurance, microinsurance","February 06, 2024 06:30 PM IST","The Parliamentary Panel on Finance feels that there is a need to rationalise the GST rate on insurance products, especially health and term insurance.","The parliamentary panel on finance, led by MP Jayant Sinha, has recommended to reduce the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on health insurance products for senior citizens and microinsurance products below 18 percent to make it more affordable.“The Committee feels that there is a need to rationalise the GST rate on insurance products, especially health and term insurance, which is 18 percent at present. The high rate of GST results in a high premium burden, which acts as a deterrent to getting insurance policies,” the panel said in its report on ‘Performance review and regulation of insurance sector’.The committee is of the view that to make insurance more affordable, GST rates applicable to health insurance products, particularly retail policies for senior citizens and microinsurance policies and term policies may be reduced, it said.Insurance PSUsThe Committee observed that the financial condition of four public sector General Insurance Companies needs to be strengthened.“They lack adequate capital and have lagging insolvency ratios. In regard to their performance, the Committee have been apprised that their overexposure in health insurance business, i.e. 50 percent of their total business, has been one of the reasons, as the same has led to Rs 26,000 crore of losses in five years from 2016-17 to 2020-21.The Committee has recommended that an appropriate strategic roadmap to implement all the remedial steps, should be established for these companies to improve their competitiveness and enable them to attract sufficient capital and talent to grow. This roadmap should have appropriate timelines for demonstrable performance improvement. If performance does not improve sufficiently quickly, there should be further aggressive measures that should be evaluated. The Board of each of these Public Sector General Insurance Companies should approve these strategic roadmaps and commit to performance improvements, it said.MicroinsuranceThe New microinsurance products need to be developed and provided as affordably as possible for the financial protection and security of the low-income and vulnerable sections of society who are exposed to various risks such as health, crop, life, etc. The committee recommended that the capital requirement of Rs 100 crore may be reduced for such players.“Developing innovative and customised products that suit the needs and preferences of the target population is vitally important. The committee feels that this may require encouraging smaller, niche players in various geographic areas. The committee recommends that the capital requirement of Rs 100 crore may be reduced for such players,” it said.Motor InsuranceIn order to ensure enforcement of motor insurance, the committee suggested that financial institutions should provide auto and commercial vehicles loans when they have proof of insurance coverage. “Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) and Reserve Bank of India should evaluate these requirements,” the report said.As per the Motor Annual Report, 2019-20, of the Insurance Information Bureau of India (IIB), of the over 25.33 crore vehicles on the road in India as on March 31, 2020, the percentage of uninsured vehicles was nearly 56 percent. This indicates that a large number of vehicles (particularly commercial vehicles) are plying on the roads without any insurance cover, which poses a risk to the owners and third parties in case of accidents or damages.Composite licensing In India, as per the provisions of the Insurance Act, 1938, life insurers can only offer life insurance products, while general insurers can offer non-life insurance products, such as health, motor, fire, marine, etc. The IRDAI does not allow composite licensing for insurance companies, which means that an insurance company cannot offer both life and non-life insurance products under one entity.The committee in the report stated, “Allowing composite licensing could provide further impetus to the insurance sector owing to its various benefits. It can cut costs and compliance hassles for insurers, as they can run different insurance lines under one roof. It can also offer customers more choice and value, such as a single policy that covers life, health, and savings. It can boost insurance reach and awareness in India, as customers can get all-in-one insurance from one provider, with lower premiums and easier claims.Ayushman BharatThe report recognised Ayushman Bharat Scheme as a highly successful initiative of the government to provide much-needed health insurance coverage to low-income families.But the scheme can be further strengthened making it possible for the Missing Middle to participate on a paid basis, which would close a major insurance gap, the panel said in the report."

Vittal said that 25 percent of the total smartphones in the industry will be 5G-enabled by March 2025.,"Bharti Airtel said that the 'real' improvement in its average revenue per user (ARPU) and 5G monetisation will happen only with tariff repair or tariff hikes in the market, even as the telco continues to see an organic increase in its ARPU.“We have seen an improvement in the ARPU, in the absence of tariff hikes…there is a movement up in terms of average revenue per user on an organic basis,” Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive, said during the Q3 investor call on February 6.Vittal said that Airtel’s ARPU is seeing a modest improvement every quarter due to feature phone-to-smartphone migration, postpaid data monetization, international roaming, and subscribers shifting to higher price plans.“The real improvement will come only if there is a tariff repair. It's not a question of if it will happen. It's a question of when it will happen,” he added.Bharti Airtel on February 5 reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 2,442.2 crore for the October-December quarter, growing 54 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Its revenue came in at Rs 38,339 crore, up 6.3 percent from Rs 36,062 crore in the year-ago period, Bharti Airtel said in an exchange filing.The company’s mobile average revenue per user per month (ARPU) was at Rs 208 - better than estimates - and up nearly 8 percent against Rs 193 in the same quarter last year. The ARPU was driven by a ""consistent strategy of acquiring high-value customers and improved realisations.5G monetisation is a challenge Airtel does not plan to bring differential pricing for its 5G service for regular subscribers. It said such a move would impact the 5G adoption.Airtel currently has 65 million 5G users across the country. Vittal said that 25 percent of the total smartphones in the industry will be 5G-enabled by March 2025.“5G has become really about free data today in India. Free data on 5G is a headwind on any sort of monetisation as far as 5G is concerned.,” Vittal said, adding that there is no real 5G monetisation on the consumer business side.He, however, said that it's Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) service will give it some ability to monetise the latest technology, but that will be “modest” given the amount of capex that went into 5G deployment.The company has started its work on the private 5G front and is working with an auto ancillary manufacturer, a handset manufacturer, and an industry equipment maker. “Some of these companies are looking to deploy private 5G. We have indeed deployed four or five such projects. but, this is a smaller part of the overall monetisation…this is not meaningful in any sense,” Vittal said.Airtel to discontinue 2G in coming yearsThe top executive said 2G technology’s contribution to Airtel’s business has become relatively small and is in the ballpark of around 17 percent, and the next few years, a substantial amount of its 2G customers will disappear.“In markets like Gujarat, Maharashtra, Kerala, Mumbai, and Delhi, they are in single digits. But you still see reasonably high contributions in markets like Bihar, UP, MP, Chhattisgarh, etc. In my sense, in the next few years, you should start seeing substantial, almost disappearing, use of 2G. We can decide what we do then,” Vittal said.“The amount of spectrum that we use is very limited for 2G. It's used dynamically long with 4G networks,” the executive added.The executive said that Airtel’s Capex will moderate in the next fiscal year after an elevated Capex for the ongoing fiscal due to a large scale of 5G rollout, including rural expansion and the telco’s investments in other businesses, including data centres, B2B and home broadband.“We had said that capex is going to be elevated this year. In the longer term, what the capex-to-revenue ratio should be, I think it depends on what happens to the industry in terms of tariff repair.

This has prompted some banks with surplus funds to park money in the SDF.Under the SDF, eligible entities can place deposits with the RBI on an overnight basis.Since the start of this month, funds parked in the SDF by banks on a daily basis remained at over Rs 1 lakh crore. As per RBI data, banks parked Rs 1.02 lakh crore on February 2, Rs 95,979 crore on February 3, Rs 1.11 lakh crore on February 4, and Rs 1.25 lakh crore on February 5.Also read: Paytm mess likely to make industry cautious but big impact unlikely, say expertsSkewed distribution of liquidityAccording to treasury experts, the current situation shows the skewed distribution of liquidity among banks.Pandey from Arete Capital said a higher amount parked in the SDF alongside a significant deficit liquidity can indeed indicate a skewed distribution of liquidity within the banking system.Last year too, skewed distribution of liquidity was witnessed and the RBI Governor highlighted this in the monetary policy.In the June monetary policy, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the prevalence of surplus liquidity amidst higher recourse to the MSF by some banks suggests skewed liquidity distribution within the banking system.VRRR auctionsTo tackle this situation, the central bank conducted four VRRR auctions, with the amounts parked seen gradually increasing.The first VRRR auction conducted by the RBI was on February 2 worth Rs 50,000 crore, and banks parked only Rs 3,975 crore at the cut-off rate of 6.49 percent.It conducted the next auction on February 5 for a notified amount of Rs 50,000 crore, wherein banks parked Rs 18,750 crore.Further, on February 6, the RBI conducted two overnight VRRR auctions worth Rs 75,000 crore and Rs 50,000 crore, respectively. In these auctions, banks placed bids worth Rs 27,538 crore and Rs 41,804 crore, respectively.All these auctions indicated that banks placed greater quantum of funds through VRRR auctions.Also read: State Bank of India to buy out SBI Caps' stake in SBICAP VenturesWill RBI conduct variable rate repo auctions?Money market experts are of the view that along with VRRR, the central bank will also conduct variable rate repo (VRR) auctions to address the high deficit liquidity in the banking system.“The RBI closely monitors liquidity conditions and may use VRR auctions as a tool to manage liquidity and encourage banks to deploy their excess funds more effectively,” Srinivasan added.Liquidity in the banking system has been in deficit over the last few months. But the deficit has narrowed since the start of this month due to month-end government spending.The liquidity deficit which was Rs 2.68 lakh crore on January 29, has narrowed to Rs 1.22 lakh crore on February 6."

Larsen and Toubro said that they have made a counterclaim of Rs 500 crore against the Public Works Department (PWD).The notice was issued on February 3, asking the company to respond within 15 days. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on June 19, 2022 inaugurated the 1.3-km-long tunnel and five underpasses as part of the Pragati Maidan Integrated Transit Corridor Project that aims to ease connectivity between central Delhi with the eastern parts of the city and the satellite towns of Noida and Ghaziabad.The tunnel has witnessed multiple closures due to waterlogging during the Delhi floods last year. The notice alleged that the project with the passage of time revealed ""glaring infirmities that were not only technical in nature but were also design flaws"".""The most glaring as well as alarming issue was the accumulation of water across various locations in the tunnel/underpass. ""This issue, especially during the monsoon season, rendered the entire project non-operational for the general public and ultimately ended up causing far more blockages and congestion along the arterial roads of the entire New Delhi area which defeated the very purpose of this ambitious project,"" the notice stated.The notice also underlined the fact that the entire design and execution of the project was under the control of L&T and no government agency had any role in it. The PWD in the notice said the company's ""failure to act on the issues being faced by the general public and the resultant public safety hazard, is not only a dereliction of your duty/obligations towards the general public but also contravenes the terms of the agreement.""Given the documentary records and urgency involved in the redressal process, you are put on notice to respond as to why action should not be instituted against your company within 15 days from the date of receipt of this notice."" In the interim, it directed the company to immediately deposit a ""minimum token amount of Rs 500 crore"" and initiate repair and rectification work on the locations already identified in the project site.The PWD in the notice also stated that despite detailed communications and requests from the government agencies, including but not limited to the PWD, seeking urgent and immediate redressal of the issues being faced by the engineers as well as the general public, all the issues have now remained unaddressed for over two months. ""While the contractual terms are clear on the aspect of the maintenance of the project, what has come to light is the fact that the technical and final project design is at variance from the schematics of the intended construction expressly agreed by your company,"" it said.The ""notable variation"" in the actual construction is likely to cause an ""irreparable and unprecedented impact"" on the underpasses and tunnels which are intended to be utilised by the public for years, the notice stated. An L&T spokesperson said his company has filed a counter-claim of Rs 500 crore.""PWD, Delhi, is an esteemed client and we value the long years of association we have enjoyed with them. However, L&T would like to state that a counter-claim of Rs 500 crore has been made by the company against PWD, Delhi,"" the spokesperson said."

This, according to government officials, will help the central government meet its medium-term objective of lowering the deficit to 4.5 percent or below by 2025-26.However, Fitch has expressed doubt over the government's target.""We still think it will be challenging for the government to achieve its 2025-26 deficit target,"" it said.""Trade-offs between economic growth and consolidation are likely to become more acute in the coming years, and we expect the government to maintain a core focus on economic growth outcomes, particularly by sustaining strong capex. Meanwhile, the slow pace of the fiscal consolidation process in the wake of the pandemic could leave India's public finances exposed in the event of further major economic shocks,"" it added.The Indian government has been in a running battle with global ratings agencies – S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Services, and Fitch – as it thinks that the lowest investment grade rating assigned to the country is not a fair reflection of its economic strength. In a post-Budget interview to Moneycontrol, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said that while the government would welcome a ratings upgrade, it was not ""chasing"" one.Fitch analysts, who affirmed the BBB- rating on India with stable outlook on January 16, also said that while the fiscal deficit target for 2024-25 pointed at a ""slightly faster"" pace of consolidation than expected, the targets are ""broadly in line"" with the agency's assumptions when it affirmed its rating on India.""As such, they are unlikely to lead to significant changes in the sovereign's credit profile, although this modestly reduces near-term risks to the fiscal trajectory and signals the government's commitment to its fiscal consolidation plans,"" they said.According to Fitch, India's general government fiscal deficit – Centre plus states combined – is seen at 8.6 percent of GDP in 2023-24. This, it said, is high relative to other countries in the 'BBB' rating category, where the median figure was 3.5 percent of GDP in 2023.In terms of the stock of public debt, Fitch thinks the government's focus on cutting the deficit will help to ""slightly"" reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. It expects the ratio to fall slightly over the next five years to just above 80 percent assuming a continued decline in the fiscal deficit and robust nominal growth of around 10.5 percent.Commenting broadly on the budget, Fitch said that as it was an interim one ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, further clarity on the fiscal plans of the new government will only be available later. However, it expects the fiscal deficit target to be maintained in the full Budget, which will likely be presented in July if the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party government returns to power. Fitch thinks this is likely to happen.On capex, Fitch expects the higher target of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for 2024-25 to remain supportive of growth, which it sees moderating to 6.5 percent from 7.3 percent in 2023-24.""We believe India is well-placed to sustain higher rates of growth in the medium term relative to many of its peers, with the capex drive helping to underpin this view,"" it said."

Those prices drove inflation and contributed to a cost-of-living crisis, drawing outrage from consumers facing higher utility bills while energy companies saw explosive growth in their bottom lines.Energy prices have since fallen as a weak global economy holds back demand for fossil fuels to power cars, planes, factories and more.Despite the drop in annual earnings, BP kept its dividend steady and said it would buy back $1.75 billion in shares as well as commit to $3.5 billion in additional share buybacks for first half of this year. The company's stock rose 5.75% in morning trading.Looking back, 2023 was a year of strong operational performance with real momentum in delivery right across the business, CEO Murray Auchincloss said in a statement. We are confident in our strategy, on delivering as a simpler, more focused and higher-value company.It's the first earnings report since Auchincloss permanently got the top job last month. A former BP chief financial officer, Auchincloss had served as interim chief executive since Bernard Looney resigned in September after it emerged that Looney had failed to disclose to the board past relationships with company colleagues.Environmentalists and other groups said energy giants like BP are prioritizing shareholders over fighting climate change.It's clear that BP and other fossil-fuel giants cant be trusted to drive the green transition: they will always prioritise their shareholders over the needs of the economy and the planet, said Joseph Evans, researcher at the Institute for Public Policy Research."

Revenue is expected to grow 9.7 percent YoY to Rs 4,646 crore in Q4FY24. Nestle India follows a January-to-December financial year.The company’s Earnings Before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) margin is expected to increase 81 basis points to 23.8 percent in the October-to-December quarter, mainly due to improvement in pricing and mix.Most FMCG firms in India saw lower volume growth in October-December due to a non-pick-up in the delayed festive season.

Any text that represents human dialogue is critical for training so-called conversational agents, which is why OpenAI heavily mined the internet forum Reddit Inc to build its own popular chatbot","For many people, Facebook is the internet, and the number of its users is still growing, according to Meta Platforms Inc’s latest financial results. But Mark Zuckerberg isn’t just celebrating that continuing growth. He wants to take advantage of it by using data from Facebook and Instagram to create powerful, general-purpose artificial intelligence. Sounds great and Meta is well positioned to do it, but his billions of users may end up paying the price with their privacy and more.Here’s how Zuckerberg teased his next move in AI on Thursday:“The next key part of our playbook is learning from unique data and feedback loops in our products…  On Facebook and Instagram, there are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the Common Crawl dataset and people share large numbers of public text posts in comments across our services as well.”The point that Zuck makes here about “Common Crawl” startled observers in the tech press, because that archive is already huge: 250 billion web pages spanning 17 years. It’s one of the biggest and most popular repositories of the public internet used for training AI systems today. When OpenAI launched its GPT-3 language model in 2020, close to 60 percent of the text used to train the system came from Common Crawl.But Meta’s data mountain is even bigger, which means it could theoretically build “smarter” AI. That’s because research has shown that training AI models on more data tends to make them more capable and accurate. That formula has worked wonders for OpenAI, which over the years hasincreased the amount of data used to create models like ChatGPT.If Zuckerberg wants to make a more powerful chatbot, the pile of data he’s sitting on is especially valuable because so much of it comes from comment threads. Any text that represents human dialogue is critical for training so-called conversational agents, which is why OpenAI heavily mined the internet forum Reddit Inc. to build its own popular chatbot.It’s easy to scoff whenever Zuckerberg talks about a new ambition -- whether it’s bots or crypto or the metaverse. His latest quixotic vision is especially grand: to build “general intelligence,” or software systems that meet or surpass human intelligence. But with all that data, Zuckerberg’s quest looks doable. The problem is what the fallout could be for the rest of us.It’s odd that in the same message where Zuckerberg said that his AI team had been working on building general intelligence “for more than a decade,” he also said that Facebook would only now turn to its user’s data to build models as “the next key part of our playbook.” Why hasn’t Meta done that already? Perhaps because using all that data isn’t so straightforward. For one thing, it would represent yet another infringement on the privacy of Facebook’s 3 billion users and Instagram’s 1.5 billion users. In the same way OpenAI has come under fire for scraping up the copyrighted data of artists and writers to train its models, Facebook stands to face reputational blowback for exploiting people’s data all over again. Not only does that raise thorny ethical questions, doing so could require stringent data handling practices and compliance with global data protection laws, which could raise the hackles of European regulators.The other issue is all the bias and toxicity in the data. OpenAI had to deal with this issue with Common Crawl, whose vast trove included web pages like adultmovietop100.com and adelaide-femaleescorts.webcam, according to a 2021 study by the University of Montreal. The same study says that between 4 percent and 6 percent of all the websites in Common Crawl included racial slurs, hate speech, or racially charged conspiracy theories.While Facebook’s content-moderation software has become better at blocking hate speech and conspiracy theories, it’s not perfect and tends to be worse in countries outside the United States. Some of the content on Facebook that gets flagged as toxic doesn’t get reviewed by a humananymore and is left on the site. Worse: When Zuckerberg said that Meta’s data was bigger than that of Common Crawl, he was likely lumping in the company’s historic archive that would include all the hyperbolic political content and fake news that were on the site before Zuckerberg took pains to clean it up.All the work that must go into careful data handling and checking might explain why Zuckerberg has only now talked about capitalizing on the data mountain that he sits on. If he doesn’t do it properly, he risks reliving the nightmare of public criticism about how Facebook has handled fake news and harmful content.Still, if there’s one thing we know about Zuckerberg, it’s that he has a Caesar-like obsession with winning and domination. Last week, about 24 hours after he faced a crowd of parents in Washington, DC who accused him of leading their children to self-harm or even suicide, he went on to announce one of Meta’s most successful financial quarters yet and tease how he’d use people’s data to create powerful AI.The proximity of those events should serve as a reminder: Facebook’s path to riches has hurt many. So too might its road to building powerful AI.Parmy Olson is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views do not represent the stand of this publication. Credit: Bloomberg "

Together, the Big Three returned more than $80 billion to shareholders last year, up from $78 billion in 2022 despite lower oil and gas prices, lower refining margins and fewer trading opportunities","Big Oil has delivered a set of remarkable earnings. Without fanfare, ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Shell Plc all did in the fourth quarter what they’d promised: Start new oil and gas projects; cut costs; return lots of money to shareholders. It’s a model for the notoriously boom-and-bust industry.Together, the three companies at the top of the global energy industry returned more than $80 billion to shareholders last year, up from $78 billion in 2022 despite lower oil and gas prices, lower refining margins and fewer trading opportunities.The cash gusher cemented the companies as one of the stock market’sbiggest payers, trailing only the big tech companies. On the basis of dividends and share buybacks, Exxon and Chevron were last year among the top-10 payers in the S&P 500 Index. The only two other industrial companies among the 10 largest were drug giant Johnson & Johnson and military behemoth RTX Corp.Now, Big Oil needs to turn that feat into a recurring event – without the help of another energy crisis. Financial acumen, rather than geopolitical upheaval, will be key. So, it would be sticking to the plan that has tentatively attracted anew some investors previously disenchanted with Big Oil: focus on return on capital employed. On average, that measure was in double digits for the trio for the second consecutive year in 2023.But let’s face it, the industry would need to do that quarter after quarter after quarter for the foreseeable future. Investor scepticism shows in their market valuation. Take Exxon. On a price-to-book ratio, it’s trading at just two times, well below the three-to-four times of its golden era in the early 2000s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chevron and Shell are trading at even lower levels.And Big Oil still doesn’t have many allies in Wall Street, and certainly even fewer in the greener City of London. In the climate-crisis era, Fossil Fuel Inc needs to shower shareholders with money just to keep investors onside.From the sound of it, industry chief executives get it. Last week, they mentioned the word “plan” 31 times on their post-earnings conference calls – the fourth highest number of mentions in 25 years, according to Bloomberg data. Exxon CEO Darren Woods was paradigmatic. In quick succession, he told shareholders Exxon would go “forward into the plan”; it’s already “on that plan”; and, in some areas, “ahead of our plans.”What’s the plan exactly? To my mind, it’s a three-fold endeavour. First, run the assets well. The simplest dollar earned in the oil industry is that coming from running an oilfield, refinery or chemical plant as close as possible to 100% of the time. Downtime is bad business. That doesn’t mean compromising on safety. The opposite is true: preventive maintenance can save money avoiding, more costly failures. Running the assets well has a broader meaning: deliver new projects on schedule.Second, keep a tight leash on capital expenditures. Over the last two years, Big Oil has done a good job reducing capex compared to the heyday of the early 2000s. Yet, more recently, capex has been running slightly above guidance. Exxon is a big culprit. The company argues it spent more because it saw great opportunities. Perhaps, but investors have heard that before – and it didn’t end well. Stephen Richardson, an analyst at Evercore Inc, had suggested a good approach to Exxon’s capital spending, which can be applied across all of Big Oil. It echoes the Cold War’s motto of nuclear disarmament: Investors should trust the company’s spending, but also verify that the promised returns are delivered.Third, operational spending needs to continue to decline, if possible, ahead of schedule. Opex, as it's known, grabs far less attention than capex. Yet, it’s more important because any savings tend to be long-lasting. The problem is that saving money from day-to-day spending isn’t easy, and involves mundane measures like telling staffers to print in black-and-white, rather than colour. Ungratifying as it is, it would keep free cash for paying shareholders, particularly if oil and gas prices drop further in 2024 and 2025. Opex control would be even more important for Exxon and Chevron as both digest big acquisitions (Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Hess Corp, respectively) where synergies depend a lot on reducing overlapping day-to-day spending.The stuff of the next 12 or 24 months isn’t flashy. It isn’t about $150-a-barrel oil, sky-high gas prices or another convulsion in the Middle East or Russia. It’s about becoming a boring cash machine.

The decision was driven by soaring crude prices at the time.The group has been battling mounting debt, raising concerns over its expansion plans.“We will add 300,000 barrels of oil and gas, including offshore. We will open up our north-east asset where we have got a license. Our focus will be - exploration, exploration exploration,” he said on the sidelines of India Energy Week 2024 in Goa on February 6.The company restructured its debt worth $3.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023-24 with bondholders approving the plan. Even though the company’s net debt stood at Rs 62,493 crore as of December 31, it is gearing up to scale up the energy business.Cairn Oil and Gas will invest in existing blocks and will participate in bids for upcoming blocks.When asked if his company will bid for the next round of exploration projects that will come up for bidding under the Open Acreage Licensing (OALP) mechanism, Agarwal said, “Yeah, we'll have to. We're expecting something to come and we'll definitely look at it.”India Opportunity Inaugurating the second edition of India Energy Week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will invest $67 billion in the gas sector over the next 5-6 years. The PM said that India is investing more than ever in energy right now and every energy leader is looking at India to invest.Agarwal said, “I can tell you one thing, nobody will regret investing in India in hydrocarbon. This is the only place in the world where you produce and sell also as there is a market too.”Agarwal said the recent geopolitical tensions, including the Hamas-Israel conflict, have highlighted the need for countries like India to scale up their energy production.The Vedanta Chairman said that India’s large population offers a big market and the youth population offers a talent pool for the industry, which investors would be attracted to.Talking about Indian talent running the upstream companies globally — in the USA and the Middle East, he said that if they get an opportunity in India, they will come back.He said that while the changes in the bidding process have made the process more attractive, increasing the duration of the license for these blocks would give companies like Vedanta the comfort of investing big bucks without the fear of license expiration."

The brokerage believes these refiners are seeing multiples re-rate as investors reassess long-term growth prospects. Morgan Stanley pointed out four key factors driving the re-rating.Among the reasons propelling re-rating in these stocks, Morgan Stanley said that India remains the fastest-growing market globally for fuel demand with improved clarity on global fuel demand over the medium term as internal combustion engine vehicle demand remains strong. It also said that hardware upgrades by refiners prior to COVID 19 are now being reflected in earnings as the energy market becomes less volatile. Besides, the SOE reforms, which led to re-ratings in countries like China, Singapore and Korea, are now being reflected in India as well. ""Stocks of these oil refining and marketing companies  are seeing multiples re-rate as investors reassess long-term growth prospects,"" said the brokerage in its report. Morgan expects both earning upgrades as well as re-rating in these stocks with multiples rising to levels seen in 2014-2o017, said the report.For Reliance Industries, the report said its NAV is starting to reflect energy upside. “In our view, RIL’s implied refinery multiples have re-rated by around 10 percent since last quarter. While there is also an element of the investment cycle being unwound, a large part is driven by the fuel business. Improving refining margins and their impact on deleveraging, along with clarity on margins due to limited windfall taxes on exports, are all falling in line,"" the report added.Morgan Stanley believes the re-rating will be followed by an earnings upgrade cycle. Over the past six months, HPCL has run up more than 100 percent, IOC 99 percent, and BPCL has risen 69 percent.Over the past month alone, IOC has run up 39 percent while HPCL has surged 24 percent, and BPCL has also gained 34 percent.In terms of valuations, Morgan Stanley noted that ""IOCL trades at one year forward P/BV of 1.2x, 19 per cent below +1 standard deviation; BPCL trades at one year forward P/BV of 1.5x, near historical averages; and HPCL trades at one year forward P/BV of 1.5x, near +1SD,"" said Morgan Stanley."

The surge in shareholder wealth has been driven by buying interest seen in Tata Consultancy Services, Tata Motors Tata Power and Indian Hotels shares this year.Tata Consultancy Services Ltd surged over 9 percent so far in 2024 while Tata Motors Ltd advanced over 20 percent. Tata Power jumped 18 percent while Indian Hotels gained 16 percent. The Tata Group has 24 companies listed on exchanges.Meanwhile, Tejas Network, Tata Elxsi and Tata Chemicals dropped over 10 percent so far this year while the remaining stocks gained in the range of 1-5 percent.TCS reached a new high on February 6, surging over 4 percent and crossing the market cap of Rs 15 lakh crore. The boost is attributed to encouraging deal wins in Q3FY24, with a total contract value of $8.1 billion, up 3.8 percent from the previous year. The management expressed confidence in long-term growth, anticipating client investments to increase as the challenging macro conditions subside.TCS recently announced a 15-year partnership expansion with Aviva, a UK insurance leader, aiming to transform the ""UK Life business."" Though the deal size is undisclosed, sources suggest it's a mega deal, typically exceeding $500 million. This follows a seasonally weak quarter for TCS with no large reported deals.Tata Motors stock witnessed a surge in the past month driven by strong earnings with contributing factors like the easing impact of semiconductor chip shortage, lower raw material prices and robust demand. The company achieved a notable 27 percent YoY volume growth and a substantial 22 percent YoY revenue growth with the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) division posting a remarkable 16.2 percent EBITDA margin.Despite ongoing chip challenges, JLR's supply has improved, reducing order backlog. The domestic business showed in-line results, with a 19 percent revenue growth and a significant 270-basis point expansion in EBITDA margin. New model launches and strong demand are expected to boost future volumes. The management is optimistic about sustained demand in the Indian market, driven by economic recovery and government emphasis on infrastructure development. The PV business is anticipated to continue its momentum with a projected industry growth of 5-7 percent in FY24, analysts said.Tata Power has shown growth in 2024, aligning with the trend in the power and energy sector. The anticipation of additional momentum stems from the government's increased emphasis on expanding renewable energy use in the Interim Budget 2024. As one of the leading private sector players, Tata Power boasts a substantial clean energy portfolio of 5,500 MW, covering solar, wind and hydropower.Indian Hotels sustained strong performance across key metrics, driven by robust demand. The optimistic future outlook from management is encouraging, leading analysts to anticipate a robust earnings trajectory in the coming years, supported by various growth factors.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Backed by SoftBank, and earlier by billionaire investor Warren Buffett and China's Alibaba, it has 100 million monthly users and clocked $61 billion worth of merchant payments between October and December.But many merchants are now refusing to deal with Paytm after India's central bank last week asked its banking unit – which mainly powers the popular payments app – to cease most operations from March 1 for ""persistent non-compliance"".In southern Telangana state, around 2,000 shops have put signs saying ""No Paytm, Pay Cash"", and some have even covered up the Paytm QR code which customers scan for payments, said Mohammed Salahuddin, a member of a local retailers association.""I have decided to avoid using Paytm. Customers have to give cash,"" he said.To counter such concerns, the company is sending sales staff directly to customers ranging from roadside snack sellers to big retail outlets to ask them to use Paytm's partner banks so that they can continue to receive payments, more than 40 shopkeepers and several company sales staff said.""We are receiving a lot of calls from merchants,"" said a Paytm team leader in Chennai, adding that each salesperson there is tasked with visiting at least 10 shops daily.In a statement to Reuters, Paytm said customers continued to use its app, adding it is onboarding more merchants and ""there will be no disruptions"" for vendors who ""can seamlessly be transitioned"" to other partner banks.However, with about 15% of Paytm's 40 million merchants needing to be migrated, the company last week said it would be a ""large exercise"".Very few shopkeepers in India are also tech savvy, which adds to the challenge.RIVALS CASH INPaytm has dominated digital payments in India but since the crackdown its stock has plunged 39%, wiping $2.3 billion off its value. That has potentially created an opportunity for bigger rivals including Walmart and Google.Paytm app downloads fell 20% last week, versus the previous week, data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower shows, while rival apps including Walmart's PhonePe and Google Pay recorded an average 52% growth. PhonePe in particular registered a 76% downloads growth.A Reuters reporter on Sunday received a push notification from Google Pay to migrate his Paytm-linked mobile number for bank transfers, and an industry source said many merchants were rushing to register with Google. Google said in a statement that it was supporting vendors and users.PhonePe, which offers many services similar to Paytm's, took out front-page newspaper advertisements targeting merchants, saying: ""Business runs best when it runs on PhonePe"".PhonePe, in a statement, said it was seeing a surge in demand for their payment offerings, including its speakers: tiny devices that help digitally challenged retailers and eases payment tracking.The speakers – which give audio alerts to vendors when payments are received – were pioneered by Paytm with its Soundbox that is used by about 7 million Indian merchants.Neil Shah, director at Counterpoint Research, estimates Paytm's rivals – PhonePe's SmartSpeaker and Google's Soundpod – have around 3 million such devices in India.""This is where PhonePe and Google can now hit,"" he said. ""The Soundbox and service from Paytm has been a major stickiness factor for Paytm which contributed to its success."""

Moreover, they will now remain cautious to ensure they are fully compliant and their operations do not cause any regulatory breach, they said.“By and large, the payments bank industry is not going to get impacted too much because most of the players in this field are largely following the regulatory guidelines,” said Naresh Malhotra, a former senior official with the State Bank of India (SBI) who presently works as a banking industry consultant.Further, former SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, said the payments bank model was not successful from the beginning, so many licences have been  surrendered. The business model is quite restrictive, making it difficult to operate profitably. Payments bank have no proper business plan , Kumar said.“There are hardly any payments banks operational so as such, no impact,” he added.On January 31, the RBI imposed major business restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL), including a ban on accepting fresh deposits.Following this, the stock price of the payments bank’s parent, One97 Communications Ltd, has crashed by over 42 percent, ending at Rs 438.35 on February 5.Currently, there are few players left in the payments bank segment and as per experts, most are currently following all required rules and regulations. Apart from PPBL, the other existing players are Airtel Payments Bank, Jio Payments Bank, India Post Payments Bank, Fino Payments Bank and NSDL Payments Bank, as per RBI data.However, some experts are of the view that more clarity is required on what went wrong at PPBL before gauging the impact on its peers.“At this stage, one doesn’t know if the problem is limited to Paytm Payments Bank or all across. If it was a problem all across, then the RBI would not have singled out Paytm Payments Bank alone,” former Securities and Exchange Board of India executive director JN Gupta said.Also read: Not exploring legal options, says Paytm Payments BankBenefit for othersBanking industry experts said the fiasco at Paytm Payments Bank is likely to help the others. This, they said, is because the current controversy could in all likelihood see Paytm Payments Bank’s existing customers start moving their business to its rivals.“They (PPBL) will lose the customer base and business,” Malhotra said. In his opinion, Paytm Payment Bank's operations will be taken over by some other big name in the banking, financial services and insurance or BFSI space and “I think discussions are underway with a few banks or NBFCs (non-banking financial companies)”.Adding to this, Kumar said as far as customers are concerned, if there is a choice between payments banks and commercial banks, the odds of them moving to the latter are very high, given the inherent advantages a full-service lender offers over a pure-play payments bank.Industry speculationsIn the last few days, some media reports said that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) could initiate an investigation against PPBL, the banking arm of digital payments firm Paytm, if charges related to money laundering crop up. Also, there were some reports that Jio Financial Services (JFS) was in talks to acquire the wallet business of Paytm.Parent One97 Communications on February 4 clarified that neither company nor its related entities were facing any investigation from the ED.The company ""categorically denies any investigation by the Enforcement Directorate on OCL (One97 Communications Ltd), our associates and/or its Founder and CEO for anti-money laundering activities"", the fintech major said in a regulatory filing.Further, on February 5, JFS has dismissed as “speculative” reports that the firm was in talks to acquire the wallet business of Paytm, which finds itself in the middle of a regulatory firestorm.“We clarify that the news item is speculative and we have not been in any negotiations in this regard,” JFS said in the February 5 exchange notification.Paytm, too, denied reports of talks with JFS. It told exchanges on February 6 that neither the company or its associate, Paytm Payments Bank, was in any kind of negotiations.Also read: VSS, senior Paytm officials meet RBI, regulators not keen on saving wallets businessRBI’s actionThe RBI on January 31 said it had imposed business restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank.

Gas, which is used to generate electricity, make fertiliser or turn into CNG for running automobiles as well as for cooking, is considered less polluting fuel than other fossil fuels such as coal.Modi said India's world-beating economic growth rate is fuelling a surge in energy needs.""India is the world's third largest energy, oil and LPG consumer. It is the fourth largest LNG importer and refiner as well as the fourth largest automobile market,"" he said, adding the nation's energy demand is estimated to double by 2045.Noting that India Energy Week 2024 is taking place at a time when India's GDP growth rate crossed 7.5 per cent in the first six months of the financial year, Modi said that the pace of growth is higher than the global growth estimate making India the fastest growing economy in the world.He also mentioned about the International Monetary Fund's prediction of similar growth trends in the future.""Economic experts around the world believe that India will soon become the third largest economy in the world,"" Modi said.He called on global investors to seize the opportunity to invest in the world's fastest growing energy market.""Together, we can build a future that is prosperous and environmentally sustainable,"" he said.The prime minister also held a roundtable with global oil and gas CEOs and experts, but details were not immediately available.Elaborating on his government's plan to meet the growing demand, he said the effort is to ensure affordable fuel is available to all on a sustainable basis.The prime minister said that despite adverse global factors, India is among the few nations where petrol prices have come down and 100 per cent electricity coverage was achieved by electrifying crores of houses in the last two years.""India is not just meeting its needs but is also shaping the global direction,"" he said.The energy needs are to be met through a combination of conventional fuels and renewable sources such as biofuels and next-generation fuels such as hydrogen.India, he said, is witnessing ""unprecedented investments in the energy sector"".The record Rs 11.11 lakh crore of investment outlined in the interim budget for 2024-25 last week will see a big part going into energy, he said.""This amount will create assets in railways, roadways, waterways, airways or housing which will need energy leading to India's efforts to expand its energy capacity,"" he said.Modi said domestic natural gas production has risen due to reforms in the last few years and the country is making efforts to take the percentage of gas in the primary energy mix from 6.3 per cent to 15 per cent. ""This will see an investment of about USD 67 billion in the next 5-6 years."" Highlighting the circular economy and concept of reuse being a part of India's ancient traditions, the prime minister said ethanol blending in petrol has been raised to 12 per cent from 1.5 per cent in 2014 and a global alliance on biofuels formed with about 22 nations and 12 international organizations to encourage the use of biofuels in the world, creating economic opportunities worth $500 billion.Ethanol blending has led to a reduction in carbon emissions by about 42 million tonnes, he said, adding as many as 9,000 petrol pumps in the country are today selling E20 or petrol doped with 20 per cent ethanol extracted from sugarcane or grains.Also, the government is working on setting up 5,000 plants to produce compressed biogas from agri and municipal wastes.Addressing global environmental concerns, he remarked, ""despite being home to 17 per cent of the world's population, India's carbon emission share is only 4 per cent."" ""We are committed to further improving our energy mix by focusing on the development of environmentally sensitive energy sources,"" he said.The prime minister said India ranks fourth in the world in renewable energy installed capacity, which now makes up for as much as 40 per cent of the nation's installed capacity. ""In the past decade, India's solar energy installed capacity has grown by more than 20 times."" Prime minister Modi noted that the launch of a major mission, aimed at installing solar rooftop panels in one crore homes across India, will not only make one crore families self-reliant in the energy sector but also establish mechanisms to deliver excess electricity generated directly to the grid.Touching upon India's stride in the green hydrogen sector, he said the National Green Hydrogen Mission will pave the way for India becoming a centre of hydrogen production and export. He expressed confidence that India's green energy sector can make both investors and industries a sure-shot winner.India Energy Week 2024 is being held from February 6 to 9 in Goa, and is India's largest and all-encompassing energy exhibition and conference, bringing together the entire energy value chain."

To resume its primary uptrend, the index has to breach the hurdle of 22,100.Jatin Gedia, Technical Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP ParibasOn the daily charts we can see that the Nifty has been broadly trading within the range in an upward sloping channel. Until the recent swing low of 21,730 not breached, we can expect the upmove to continue towards 22,000 – 22,130.The daily and the hourly momentum indicators have a positive crossover, which is a a buy signal. Both price and momentum indicators are suggesting continuation of the positive momentum, however, considering the recent sharp reversals from the upper boundary (22,000) one needs to be cautious on the long side.Stock-specific action and sector rotation are likely to continue during this period of consolidation. Key support levels are 21,730–21,700 while immediate hurdle is at 22,100 - 22,130.Bank Nifty closed in the negative but the index seems to be oversold. The positive crossover on the hourly time frame suggests that the Bank Nifty is poised for a pullback after the recent correction. On the upside, we expect Bank Nifty to retrace till 46,500–46,800. Crucial support is at 45,370.Osho Krishan, Sr Analyst-Technical and Derivative Research, Angel OneThe broad-based buying traction levitated the undertone, which was seen in the technical chart structure for the Nifty. Amid a favourable sentiment, the index managed to maintain a positive stature and settled the day a tad above 21,900, procuring 0.72 percent to bull’s kitty.Technically, there has been insignificant development with minor alterations on a broader view of the index. However, sectoral rotation is evident, keeping the play in the market.The chart structure points to range-bound activity, with a strong nearby resistance at the 22,000 followed by 22,100. Only a decisive breakthrough can trigger the next leg of rally.

TTAN 3Q24 PAT missed on estimates, led by 200bps lower share of studded jewellery, muted demand in Q3 amid high gold prices & higher completion from smaller and unorganized players (more consumer offers). Watch margins suffered due to higher investments behind wearables/ Fastrack and higher sales of margin dilutive online channel. 4Q Jewellery demand outlook is positive (January month sales) given marriage season and stabilization in Gold prices. We expect improvement in watch margins, however Eye wear seems to be having poor visibility due to heightened competition. TTAN continues to imbibe multiple growth engines led by 1) Jewellery network expansion, regional thrust and sub brands like Mia, Zoya and Caratlane 2) Omni-channel strategy across jewellery, watches and eyewear 3) rising presence in higher growth segments of wearables, dress material, handbags and fashion accessories.OutlookTTAN is a formidable play on emerging lifestyle segments which will gain from rising discretionary spends.

NCLT has asked Byju's to file a response to the plea in two weeks, with the case now likely to come up for hearing on March 5. This is the second plea against Byju's that the NCLT has issued a notice in.During the course of the hearing, Surfer argued that Byju's owes them Rs. 2.3 crore and all of them are admitted debts. According to Surfer, they were generating leads for Byju's and passing them on; these leads were overseen and then authorised by the ed-tech company.Surfer is the fourth entity to approach the NCLT against Byju's after Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), France-based Teleperfomance Business Services company, and the lenders. Surfer's plea was filed on January 9, while it was registered on February 1. Surfer would fall under the category of operational creditor as it is a service provider.There are two kinds of creditors under IBC: operational creditors (OCs), and financial creditors (FCs). OCs are those who provide goods and services to a business but have not been paid while FCs are those who lend money to the company.While Byju's lenders are likely to be classified as FCs, Teleperformance is likely to be classified as an OC.Byju's VS BCCI:In November 2023, NCLT issued a notice in a plea by BCCI against Byju's.  The cricket board claimed that Byju's had defaulted on a payment of Rs 158 crore. “It is stated that the General notice was issued to BYJU’s vide email dated 06.01.2023 and the default amount of Rs 158 crore. excluding TDS as reflected,” the NCLT order read.Byju's previously had three significant branding partnerships with the BCCI, ICC (International Cricket Council), and FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association), all of which were up for renewal in 2023. However, the company confirmed in early 2023 that it would not renew any of them. It remains unclear whether the filed suit is related to this matter or another issue.BCCI's case is expected to come up for a hearing on February 7, 2024."

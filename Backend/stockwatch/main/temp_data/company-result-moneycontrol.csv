Should you buy, sell or hold?","February 08, 2024 09:09 AM IST","Nestle India's revenue growth was led by product price hikes, while the gross margin expanded to a 12-quarter high","Brokerages have had a mixed reaction after Nestle India reported a 4.4 percent year-on-year rise in net profit at Rs 655.6 crore for the December quarterThe FMCG major’s revenue from operations was up 8.05 percent to Rs 4,600 crore, which was below estimates. Motilal Oswal had projected growth of 11 percent for the fourth quarter.Nestle India follows January to December financial year.Domestic sales grew 8.9 percent on the back of pricing and mix growth, with strong momentum in e-commerce and out-of-home channels. The quarter was marked by an increase in brand investments across all product groups.In 2023, total sales grew over 13.3 percent and the company crossed the Rs 19,000-crore mark.The revenue growth was led by product price hikes, noted Jefferies. The gross margin expanded to a 12-quarter high to 58.6 percent, which was 370 basis points higher from the year-ago period.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Jefferies kept the ""hold"" call on the stock with a target price of Rs 2,475 apiece.Also Read | Nestle India net profit rises 4.4%; revenue gains 8% in Dec quarterThe costs of maize, sugar, oilseeds and spices were hit by uneven rainfall.

Both wallow in the list of companies with the most downgrades by analysts over the past year.","What a difference a year makes. In January 2023, having Hindustan Unilever or Asian Paints in your portfolio was a badge of honour, a clear sign that you were a serious, level-headed investor who preferred quality over quirkiness.Fast forward to today, and both these storied titans of corporate India find themselves in the list of companies that have seen the most downgrades over the past year, as per Moneycontrol’s Analyst Call Tracker for January 2024.With the number of ‘sell’ and ‘hold’ calls far outstripping ‘buy’ recommendations, HUL and Asian Paints are also among the companies with the highest level of pessimism in the Nifty pack.Curiously, both companies are bedevilled by a common foe: rising intensity in competition.The heat is onThe knives were out for HUL after the company reported a lacklustre set of numbers for Q3 FY24.Its standalone net profit increased just 0.55 percent on-year to Rs 2,519 crore, while revenue dipped 0.38 percent to Rs 14,928 crore. Both the numbers were down sequentially—a rare event for HUL.Underlying volume growth—a key metric for FMCG firms, which measures their increase in turnover excluding the impact of price hikes—came in at 2 percent, as against 5 percent for the year-ago quarter.Analysts highlighted two major reasons for the poor showing: continued weakness in rural demand and smaller regional players biting at HUL’s heels.“Interestingly, management also expects the number of categories where it would win share to be lower in the coming couple of quarters—this is due to regional and smaller players getting more aggressive in the marketplace,” analysts at JM Financial wrote in a note.“With a rural recovery driver nowhere in sight, we expect HUL’s stock to remain under pressure for the near-term,” the note added.Also Read: HUL Q3 disappoints Street, brokerages slash target prices amid uncertain outlookHUL shares have declined nearly 7 percent over the past year, while their 3-year return stands at 6.8 percent.A similar script played out in Asian Paints’ Q3 performance.While the company’s Q3 consolidated net profit surged 34 percent to Rs 1,475.16 crore, revenue growth, at 5 percent, missed Street estimates.While it posted a healthy 12 percent y-o-y volume growth supported by festive demand, analysts expect it to encounter operational challenges in the near-term.“An expected build-up in competition from newly entered large players would pose a risk to profitability in the near term,” domestic brokerage house Sharekhan said.Grasim Industries, part of the Aditya Birla Group, is set to enter the paints market in Q4 FY24, selling its products under the brand name ‘Birla Opus’. A number of other smaller players, including JSW Paints and JK Paints, are also ramping up capacity.With this, Asian Paints has a job on its hands to protect its 50-plus percent market share in the organised decorative segment.Analysts tracker: What's driving downgrades for BPCL despite a rally in stock?The entry of a large player in the decorative paints industry might put pressure on the market share of smaller players in the near term, said the Sharekhan note.“In the medium-long term, the decorative paints industry is expected to clock a 12% CAGR over FY2023-FY2027 to Rs 1,00,000 crore…,” it added.The growth drivers include a reduction in the repainting cycle to 4-5 years (from 8-10 years earlier), increased construction activity due to new real estate projects, and upgradation of premium brands in cities and large towns.Give and TakeBoth HUL and Asian Paints face another predicament: benign raw material prices are boosting their gross margins, but with competition intensifying, their advertising expenses have risen, capping profitability.HUL’s gross margin expanded by 400 bps q-o-q to 51.5 percent in Q3 FY24, led by moderation of input costs.“…the gains were ploughed back into higher advertisement spending (up 261 bps yoy at 10.5% of sales), restricting the EBITDA margin expansion to 10 bps yoy at 23.3%,” InCred Equities wrote.The HUL management expects the EBITDA margin to remain in the 23-24% range in the near term.Asian Paints, too, logged an EBITDA margin of 22.6 percent in Q3, as against the Street’s expectation of around 21 percent.“Further, favourable input prices are expected to keep gross margins improving. However, with competition (Grasim) expected to roll out its new paints portfolio in Q4 FY24, we expect higher brand spends to keep Asian Paints’ margins in check,” analysts at Anand Rathi noted.Asian Paints shares have climbed around 8 percent over the past year, while the 3-year return stands at 25 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Regarding EVs, the RBI has not agreed to that proposal so far. We will try and talk to the RBI,"" Joshi told Moneycontrol in an interview on February 7.Also Read: Start-ups must balance growth and compliance with regulations, says DFS SecyJoshi's comments come after talk of the same in August 2023 emerged following a proposal from the power ministry. However, the financial services secretary said that such representations cannot always be accommodated.""How many things will come under priority sector lending? Corporate sector too needs some avenues. There are always demands from all quarters for putting something or the other under priority sector. We might as well review the entire priority sector framework,"" he said.Banks must lend 40 percent of their adjusted net bank credit to sectors identified as priority sector, which include agriculture, micro, small, and medium enterprises, education, and housing.In a wide-ranging interview with Moneycontrol, Joshi also discussed the ongoing troubles at Paytm Payments Bank, the performance of public sector general insurers, and progress made by the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL).Excerpts from the interview:Starting with the latest development in the banking space, what can you tell us about RBI action on Paytm Payments Bank?What can I say about Paytm? It is action taken by the regulator. They regulate the banks. The government has had nothing to do until now when it comes to the actions taken on Paytm. And, we believe that the RBI must have taken the action in the overall interest of the consumer and the economy.You would have attended the meeting between the finance minister and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma on February 6...I was there in the meeting. But I can't reveal what was discussed as it is a privileged conversation. The sum and substance is that you (Paytm) have to deal with the regulator.Are there any concerns about data being leaked to China?I would not be able to comment on that as the RBI and relevant agencies look into the nitty-gritty. I am not the concerned authority.When it comes to investments, the parent firm, One97 Communications, has a subsidiary that is a payments aggregator. So, the permission that they have sought for investment from China, that is for the payment aggregator subsidiary… That application is under review. It is an inter-ministerial process. It is an FDI issue under the PN3 notification (Press Note 3, which looks to limit 'opportunistic' foreign direct investments from countries that share a land border with India) and it is under consideration.Does the government have any financial stability concerns due to the action taken by the RBI?No, it is a very small bank. And its app will continue to operate even after February 29. People can also keep withdrawing money from their Paytm Payments Bank account but can't deposit money in it.For those who are customers of the payments bank, they will have to shift their account. From what I understand, it is not the bank that will migrate the accounts. The customers will have to do it.This is the second incident in recent months in the banking-fintech space, with the first being the BoB World issue…The issue with BoB World was different. The RBI put some restrictions and gave some instructions which Bank of Baroda fulfilled. There, customers were being on-boarded on the app without being informed. This inflated the number of users and showed greater progress. That's why the RBI punished Bank of Baroda, because a bank runs on trust. There wasn't any financial irregularity there… But it's a question of trust.Are fintech companies becoming difficult to regulate?Fintechs are very good in technology and innovations. They are young entrepreneurs from IITs, have an idea, and get backing from angel investors. They are very good. They are small (to begin with). But as they grow, they have to start interacting with the government and regulators.Suppose I am an MFI (microfinance institution) and I start an NGO and take money from banks or NBFCs and give small loans to people in villages. I don't need a licence for that. But as soon as I become Rs 100 crore in terms of size, I will have to go to the RBI. Then I can't say 'I did great work until now and will continue to do so'. I'll have to follow the law of the land.So the start-up ecosystem has to understand that as they grow, they will have to keep up with regulations and compliance. If you have a small, home-run import-export business, you don't need a licence. But you can't say that you won't take a licence from DGFT (Directorate General of Foreign Trade) or not pay a duty after growing beyond a certain size. As a player becomes larger, it becomes a risk to the system.You recently held a meeting on trade financing. What were the concerns and what steps have been recommended?Consider the payment an exporter receives from abroad. The exporter often needs various documents. In some cases, it can be difficult to get those documents because they are sometimes worried that the ship carrying their goods has gone through some problematic countries or countries that face sanctions. So banks also face issues in such instances and require clarifications from the regulator. There were a total of 22-23 cases and we discussed all those cases at the meeting.Were issues relating to Red Sea trade disruptions also discussed?No, the Red Sea as an issue wasn't discussed. I think the commerce ministry is holding a meeting on that in a few days with stakeholders. But with regard to the Red Sea, we have told banks and insurance companies that they should take into consideration the problem because ships are having to go through a longer route. For that, if trade financing or insurance is needed, those cases should be dealt with sensitivity. We have sensitised banks to be practical and not create problems.Also Read: Panel recommends sub-18% GST on health, micro insuranceThe Standing Committee on Finance has released its report on insurance and talked about composite licences.It has just come out. We will first have to study the report in detail and see what we can implement.The draft (insurance) Bill is under discussion within the government. So I think it is a very good moment in which the report has come. We will take into consideration their recommendations. But I think there are already some things that are part of the bill, such as composite licences and capital requirements.The committee's report has also talked about infusing capital in the public sector insurers...We have infused a fair bit of capital in them, around Rs 17,500 crore. That has started showing some results. In Q2 (July-September 2023), the performance of the three companies has been very good. All of them are showing profits in Q2. United India Insurance Company had a profit of Rs 204 crore, National Insurance Company had a profit of Rs 425 crore, and Oriental Insurance Company had a profit of Rs 180 crore. In comparison, in 2022-23, they posted losses of Rs 2,800 crore, Rs 3,800 crore, and Rs 4,900 crore, respectively. So, the fact they have returned to profitability, even if its small, is a big achievement. So I would say they are looking up.Does that mean there is no need for further capital infusion in these three general insurers?Their solvency ratio is still low. We have been seeking exemption from IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority) for all three. That issue is still there.But it is not necessary that we have to infuse capital. So far we have been taking exemption from IRDAI. Let us also see how they perform in Q3 (October-December 2023) and Q4 (January-March 2024). Their third quarter results should be out in three-four days I think.But there is an understanding in the government that if they perform well, based on their performance, the government might think of putting some capital into them. But it is not right that we keep putting money in them and they don't perform well.What about the capital status of public sector banks? They have not needed any capital for three years now. Have we reached a stage where PSU banks don’t need the government’s support at all?No capital, that has been very clear. They have made record profits. They have given dividends of Rs 13,000 crore.What about the government diluting its stake in PSU banks?They raise capital themselves, through QIPs (Qualified Institutional Placements) they keep diluting. But the government saying 'privatise' – it is not on the table. It is under discussion – everything is always under discussion within the government. As the DIPAM (Department of Investment and Public Asset Management) secretary was saying, it depends on the appropriate time. The overall decision is taken by them – whoever decides for PSUs also decides for PSU banks.Since many PSU banks do not meet the minimum public shareholding criteria, exemptions are needed. The current exemption is until August 2025. Will another exemption be needed beyond that?Yes, that will be needed. It (reduction in government stake) can't happen in one year.What about the next round of PSU bank consolidation?No, there is nothing going on right now. When consolidation was done, many banks were under Prompt Corrective Action. There were many restrictions on them. This situation doesn't exist now. The small banks are actually the better performers now, such as Bank of Maharashtra and Indian Overseas Bank.Who will be the candidates to merge? It will be them only, (and) Central Bank of India. But they are performing well right now. The government has given an enabling environment to the banking sector that has allowed PSU banks to perform well. There is no 'phone banking' at the political level. And at professional level, the selection of Managing Directors and Executive Directors is purely on merit. There is no recommendation from the government. Of course, people can say even the Financial Services Institutions Bureau (FSIB) can be 'managed'. But it is impossible.Does the government want to do the privatisation of PSU banks before the next leg of consolidation in the sector?Like I said, right now it is about wealth and value creation. So, at what stage a decision is taken, the government will look at the market also. And we have elections coming up. Even if the same government comes back, the thought process can also change.Is there an argument that India needs several large banks, and not just one?Our banks are large now. Within PSUs, apart from State Bank of India, we have Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, and Punjab National Bank. These are not small banks. OK, globally they may not be big. But then you have HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. They are in that category. So there are three big banks. We have to count the private sector too.What is the status of the legal changes needed for the privatisation of PSU banks? Does the Prime Minister's Office have to give its approval?It is not with the PMO. It is under discussion here with us. There is no formal proposal…The draft amendment will not take too long to do. It will be done when the time is appropriate. It is a call that will be taken when it is taken.What about the privatisation of the general insurance company?The legal amendment has been done. Now, the ball is in DIPAM's court. They will have to identify which (public insurer to privatise). Of course, when the inter-ministerial committee is formed, we will be there on it. But we have done our work and handed it over.What is the status of the power ministry's proposal to include electric vehicles in the priority sector lending category? And more broadly, is the government thinking of incentivising loans to ESG (environmental, social, and governance) sectors?The government is already promoting ESG. There is a lot of focus on non-conventional energy even in the interim Budget. Some banks have been asked to create verticals…some private banks have verticals. SBI has, maybe the smaller banks don’t have. Banks have also issued Green Bonds – SBI, NABARD, EXIM Bank. Even the Government of India has issued Green Bonds. So the government's emphasis is there.Regarding Priority Sector Lending, things like rooftop solar are already there. Regarding EVs, the RBI has not agreed to that proposal so far. We will try and talk to the RBI.But how many things will come under Priority Sector Lending? What will we remove? PSL lending is 40 percent. Corporate sector also needs some avenues. There are always demands from all quarters for putting something or the other under priority sector. We might as well review the entire priority sector framework.What about National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL)?So far, NARCL has acquired eight accounts worth Rs 58,000 crore. The target was Rs 2 lakh crore. And Swiss Challenge (an auction method process) has been initiated for two accounts worth Rs 10,000 crore. Swiss Challenge in a further nine accounts worth Rs 20,000 crore is to be initiated. So, in total Rs 88,000 crore. By the end of 2023-24, I think NARCL will be able to complete around Rs 1 lakh crore.Then there are another 23 accounts worth around Rs 60,000 crore on which NARCL has started doing its due diligence. Hopefully they will do Rs 2 lakh crore by end of 2024-25. That is the target they have been given. They are picking up speed, monitoring from the ministry is happening, we have made some changes in management, and the Finance Minister has held a meeting. All of this is bringing results."

While India wants the commitment to be legally binding, one of the European officials said the amount will likely be framed as a goal, with no legal means to claim it included in the language of the agreement.If finalized, it would mark the first time an investment commitment of this nature is secured by India as part of a free trade agreement.Switzerland’s Economy Minister Guy Parmelin said last month that the outline of a deal had been agreed upon, without giving details. Legal clarifications are currently being rushed so the deal can be signed before India holds elections likely from April, a European official with knowledge of the matter said.India’s commerce ministry didn’t immediately respond when contacted by Bloomberg News.The Swiss economy ministry said in a statement that the text of the agreement is “still to be finalized and both parties have agreed not to disclose the details at this stage.” The main points where agreement has been reached include “patent protection, which was controversial in the past, as well as a new type of investment promotion chapter,” it said.Norway’s government declined to comment on the terms of the deal.Trade BlocSwitzerland is by far India’s largest commercial partner among the members of the EFTA bloc, which comprises European nations which are not members of the European Union. Swiss two-way trade with India amounted to $17.14 billion in the 2022-23 fiscal year, out of $18.66 billion with the whole group.For EFTA countries, the agreement — which has been 16 years in the making — will allow manufacturers to export processed food and beverages, electrical machinery, and other engineering products at reduced tariffs to a potential market of 1.4 billion people. The deal is also likely to benefit the pharmaceutical and medical devices industry of the bloc.India is attracting investor interest from several countries as businesses look to diversify their supply chains from China and seek new growth markets. India expects growth of about 7% in the fiscal year beginning in April, making it one of the fastest-expanding major economies in the world. The United Arab Emirates is also considering investing as much as $50 billion in India.The investment in India from EFTA countries would mostly come from private businesses and state-sponsored vehicles and would be targeted toward existing and new manufacturing projects, according to people familiar with the discussions. The investment will see more than 1 million jobs created in India, one of the people said.The deal would also ensure easier movement of Indian professionals to the bloc and market access for some agricultural products, the people said. While Switzerland — the biggest economy in the EFTA bloc — is usually very protective of its farmers, easier market access for Indian rice could be acceptable since Switzerland only produces marginal quantities itself, a person familiar with the negotiations said."

The debt of state governments stood at 28 percent of the GDP.For advanced countries, the debt-to-GDP ratio also stands at 100 percent, Sitharaman said in the House, while pointing that the Indian government's external debt is ""na ke barabar (almost non-existing)"".The IMF report, released in December, explored various scenarios, including extreme possibilities such as events like the COVID-19 pandemic. It suggests a potential ""100 percent of debt to GDP ratio"" for India under adverse shocks by FY2028.The report also highlighted that, under favourable circumstances, the General Government Debt to GDP ratio for India could decrease to below 70 percent in the same period, countering any misinterpretation suggesting that debt would exceed 100 percent of GDP in the medium term.Notably, the government has kept the fiscal deficit target at 5.1 percent for financial year 2024-25.

The weight-loss market today stands at Rs 474 crore against Rs 174 crore in January 2022, according to data compiled by research firm Pharmarack.“Strong scientific studies with robust outcomes have helped the molecule gain a strong position in the anti-obesity market in India,” said Sheetal Sapale, VP Commercial at Pharmarack.For example, the semaglutide tablets sold in India — Rybelsus (the product launched in January 2022) — reported a value growth of 142 percent and unit growth of 138 percent in January 2024, according to Pharamrack data.This product is manufactured by Novo Nordisk and distributed by Abbott in India. It had Moving Annual Total (MAT) sales of Rs 314 crore, according to January 2024 data.In 2012, a team of researchers at Novo Nordisk developed semaglutide for a once-weekly diabetes therapy as a longer-acting alternative to liraglutide. Currently, semaglutide is available in three forms: Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus. Novo Nordisk crossed the market value of over $500 billion, making it Europe’s most valuable company because of the bumper sales of these weight-loss drugs.The sole semaglutide product available in India currently is the tablet version of the drug, which is still under patent protection. “The outcome seen in patients was so good that we also saw some copycats enter the market, though they could not flourish,” Sapale added. Currently, semgalutide has almost 66 percent of the market share in the anti-obesity segment.Other peptides like liraglutide and dulaglutide occupy 6 and 15 percent market share, respectively. The rest, 13 percent, is accounted for by the molecule Orlistat, which is off-patent. Currently, various companies are selling generic versions of this molecule in India via 23 brands.According to the US FDA, semaglutide falls within the category of drugs classified as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. It emulates the action of the GLP-1 hormone naturally released in the gastrointestinal tract following food consumption. A key function of GLP-1 involves stimulating the body to increase insulin production, thereby lowering blood glucose levels. Additionally, elevated levels of GLP-1 engage with specific regions of the brain and make people feel full.Sapale said that the increasing obesity problem in India opens up a slew of opportunities for the Indian pharma sector. Almost 5 percent of the country’s 1.4 billion population is morbidly obese. That is, around seven crore people are eligible for anti-obesity drugs, she said.This opens up a market to tackle concerns like diabetes, cardiac issues, kidney diseases, arthritis, asthma, and anxiety, which are the various complications and lifestyle diseases that could occur as a result of obesity. The market is poised for sustained growth, driven by factors such as the high prevalence of childhood obesity (11 percent) in India, indicating a prolonged need for anti-obesity drugs. She also noted that there could be a wave of products when the molecules go off-patent.Also read: Explained: What's Novartis' new anti-cholesterol jab all aboutRace for weight-loss products in IndiaAccording to available data, many Indian companies are in the race to enter the GLP-1 market. Lupin sells a dulaglutide product named Aplevant in India under a strategic collaboration with Eli Lilly.Earlier in June 2023, Sun Pharma announced results from two phase 1 studies evaluating the tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GL0034, a novel long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, in non-obese and obese adults without diabetes.In October 2023, Dr Reddy’s Labs received permission from the Central Drug Authority (CDA) to carry out a bioequivalence study of semaglutide injection in India.Biocon and Alembic Pharma had also said that the companies are evaluating opportunities as they have peptide manufacturing capacity. Cipla had mentioned that, even though it might not be in the first wave of launches, it would like to enter the semaglutide market.Also read: Novo Nordisk's parent invests in India's Manipal hospital chain"

On January 31, the Indian central bank directed Paytm Payments Bank to stop accepting fresh deposits and making credit transactions after February 29. The payments banks has also been barred from accepting top-ups in any customer accounts, including prepaid instruments, wallets, FASTags and NCMC cards.The RBI has said it is taking action against the bank after the Comprehensive System Audit and compliance validation report of the external auditors revealed ""persistent non-compliance and continued material supervisory concerns in the bank, warranting further supervisory action"".""Fintechs are very good in technology and innovations.

As they grow, they have to start interacting with the government and regulators. Suppose I am an MFI (microfinance institution) and I start an NGO and give loans to people in villages. I don't need a licence for that. But as soon as I become Rs 100 crore in terms of size, then I will have to go to the RBI. Then I can't say 'I did great work until now and will continue to do so'. I'll have to follow the law of the land,"" the secretary added.Also Read: Tough times ahead for Paytm's bank as RBI gives no concessionsPlayers in the fintech space have been made to increasingly follow regulations in both letter and spirit by the RBI. For instance, in August 2022, the central bank barred third-party accounts including prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) such as prepaid cards and wallets from the flow of lending and said that any loan remittances and repayments should be made only between the customer's and lender's bank accounts.More recently, in September 2023, the risk weights on unsecured retail loans were increased to clamp down on the rapid credit growth in this segment, which experts say has been aided by the ease and convenience provided by new-age digital lending platforms. As a result of the higher risk weights, digital lending through fintech platforms slowed down as they required greater amounts of capital, affecting the entities in this space that have grown quickly on the back of commission revenue."

That may not have been exactly what Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, meant when he said the economy appeared to be on a “golden path,” but it was the rosy scenario investors focused on.Economic growth remains robust to start the year, but some recent data and comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell have made that nirvana-like set of conditions less probable. A couple of key business sentiment measures have raised the possibility that a pickup in production could fuel a pickup in inflation. At the same time, Powell has said that the Fed wants further evidence of a sustainable easing in price pressures before cutting rates.Such reluctance signals a central bank that’s waiting for the year-over-year level of its preferred inflation gauge to return to 2 percent and, in waiting, increasing the risk of an unwelcome economic surprise. That measure has climbed at a 1.9 percent annualized rate, below the Fed’s target, over the past seven months already. With a continued fall in shelter inflation nearly assured (read this) and overall wage growth cooling to pre-pandemic levels, there’s little reason to believe inflation can pick up in a meaningful and sustainable way.Yet recent data has muddied the waters. On business sentiment, the big news last week came from the Institute for Supply Management’s closely followed manufacturing report, which showed new orders expanding again for the first time since August 2022. This has been a long time coming. I first wrote about the possibility in December 2022 — at the time, inventory levels were too high because of all the orders that had poured in in late 2021 and early 2022. While sales remained resilient, companies weren’t yet in a position to place new orders. I thought inventory levels might take until the spring of 2023 to be worked down, but it ended up taking much longer. The report showed prices paid increased as well, though to a level that on its own shouldn’t signify an inflation concern.More worrying on the inflation front was the ISM’s services report, which came out Monday, showing the biggest one-month increase in a decade for its prices-paid component. The data casts some doubt over whether overall inflation will remain at the low levels we’ve witnessed since the middle of last year.Meanwhile, the Fed looks content to wait a little longer to see how things shape up. Powell used two opportunities in the past week to push back on market pricing for an early start to policy easing. Traders have gone from seeing reasonable prospects for a 25-basis-point cut in March and the certainty of a reduction in May to now wagering on an 80 percent chance of a move in May.The risk is that this recovery in factory orders and perhaps quicker inflation is akin to a ""dead cat bounce,"" but the Fed uses the improvement in cyclical economic activity to postpone rate cuts for too long.After a miserable 2023, a modest recovery in factory orders and housing activity makes sense, with or without rate cuts. An uptick in prices for some parts of the goods economy that have been weak, such as trucking freight rates, would make sense, too.But there’s little doubt that monetary policy continues to restrain growth. With financing costs where they are, it seems unlikely that companies will rush to expand capacity or break ground on new apartments. Despite the strong addition to January payrolls, the average workweek showed another concerning drop, suggesting labour market risks remain.Rather than drawing out the timing of the first rate cut, creating anxiety among businesses and consumers needing to borrow or refinance debt, it would be better to start sooner and cut slowly, communicating that there’s no guarantee the easing cycle will be long and deep if the economy shows signs of a meaningful reacceleration. Instead, a potential uptick in cyclical economic activity and inflation after an unsustainable period of weakness threaten to confuse the Fed and keep rates overly restrictive until something breaks. Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. After thorough deliberation, the Board of the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) has approved an extension in trading hours for index futures. Previously, SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch had spoken about varying opinions within the broking community, indicating ongoing discussions. Buch had remarked, “It's a divided house, and we have yet to gather input from investors.”The National Stock Exchange (NSE) submitted a proposal to SEBI last year, requesting an extension of trading hours for index futures from 6 pm to 9 pm. However, this was met with scepticism from smaller, traditional brokers, who anticipated additional resource allocation for an evening trading desk if market timings were changed.Recent information from ANMI suggests that smaller brokers have consented to the proposed alterations. According to the NSE proposal, there would be evening sessions between 6 pm and 9 pm initially, alongside regular trading hours. In a subsequent phase, index derivatives trading might extend until 11:30 pm.Concerns weren't limited to smaller brokers; some other market participants too expressed apprehension, citing potential impacts on work-life balance due to extended trading hours.However, it's important to recognise that an open exchange does not mandate trading activity. Many major exchanges worldwide operate for extended periods. Additionally, extending NSE trading hours should be manageable if smaller brokers are able to currently manage commodities trading until midnight without issue.One needs to understand the need for extended hours in a world where the market is impacted by news from anywhere in the world. One reason is that we have seen volatility increase and post-market developments see the market open with huge gaps over the past few years because markets have become more connected. While there is some overlap between domestic and European market timings, our markets are closed when the US is open.Wars, financial crises, central bank announcements, terrorist attacks, and natural disasters are all affecting markets more severely than they used to be earlier. Part of the panic reaction could be the increased participation of retail traders globally.Extended hours allow traders to hedge their portfolios in derivative markets, mitigating potential losses. While only index futures are traded during these hours, that provides a means to safeguard positions amid market fluctuations.Despite extended trading, the bulk of trading activity in such markets occurs during regular working hours only. Extended hours primarily serve to address international developments, offering traders a chance to react to global events and potentially reduce market gaps.Currently, international traders enjoy round-the-clock trading via GIFT Nifty, granting them an advantage over Indian traders. A phased extension of trading hours aims to level the playing field and enable Indian traders to respond to global events, potentially reducing market volatility.Investing insights from our research teamCapital Small Finance Bank – Is it worth putting in your capital?Rashi Peripherals IPO: Why investors need to be cautiousShould you consider the IPO of Jana Small Finance Bank?Nykaa: Focus on growth to limit margin improvement; valuations expensiveNavin Fluorine: Going through transitional pain of de-stocking and deferralsBerger Paints Q3: Margins shine amid steady growthIdeaForge Technology: The beginning of a new chapterIn case you missed itMC Pro Election 2024 Portfolio: You can bet on these 14 select stocks to play the election themeWhat else are we reading?Eyeing alpha returns in stocks?

The tax is currently due to expire March 31.Any such move could add to the rally in benchmark Asian rice prices, which are hovering near a 15-year high after India began restricting sales of key varieties in 2023. That would be bad news for some countries in West Africa and the Middle East that rely on the South Asian nation for most of their requirements of the food staple.A spokesperson representing both the food and commerce ministries didn’t immediately comment.An extension of the levy would be a part of the government’s aggressive measures to control food inflation that climbed to almost 10% in December from a year earlier. India has already curbed exports of wheat, sugar and most rice varieties, and cracked down on hoarding. It has also extended low edible oil import duties for another year.Still, retail prices of rice in Delhi remain about 11% higher than a year ago. Food Minister Piyush Goyal launched a program Tuesday to provide subsidized rice to retail customers across the country. The government is already selling wheat flour and chickpeas at cheaper-than-market rates.Parboiled rice, which accounted for about 30% of India’s total exports before the curbs, is the result of a process that involves partial boiling of paddy before milling to boost its nutritional values and change the texture of cooked rice. The South Asian nation had a share of about 40% in the global rice trade in 2022-23."

Blue Ocean means a new, uncontested market.","The top 30 per cent of rural households in India will show an annual spend of approximately USD 540 billion by 2030, says Anand Daniel, partner at global VC fund Accel, about the increasingly aspirational segment that accounts for 52 per cent of rural consumption.""There is a Blue Ocean opportunity for startups building for rural Bharat's top 30 per cent - there is immense potential for growth and innovation in this segment, which has yet to be fully explored,"" Daniel told PTI, citing the massive runway for business models with a ""Bharat"" focus. Blue Ocean means a new, uncontested market.Internet penetration in rural India, which is getting modernised in terms of both digital and physical infrastructure, reaches 350 million users and 82 per cent of villages, he noted.Accel, an early investor in Flipkart, Freshworks and Swiggy, is excited about areas such as commerce and healthcare for the sector, Daniel said, adding that education and entertainment are the other two sectors that seem very promising.Excerpts from the interview: Q: What makes you bullish on the Bharat opportunity? A: While there is talk of a slowdown in rural India as evidenced by slower volume growth in FMCG, increased demand for work under MGNREGA and weak two-wheeler sales, these data points don't show us what's happening with the top 30 per cent of rural households.By 2030, the top 30 per cent of households will show an annual spend of approximately USD 540 billion. We know that rural India overall is a large consumer market with about USD 500 billion of annual consumption expenditure from over 915 million people.This is two-thirds of India's population. Interestingly, this rural spend is highly concentrated, with 52 per cent rural consumption coming from the top 30 per cent households. Till now, we have seen the success stories of the Indian startup ecosystem or category leaders largely built on catering to the needs of the urban Indian consumer.Given the surface area of the rural Bharat opportunity, we are optimistic that the next wave of disruption will come from daring builders catering to the needs of that top 30 per cent which is an increasingly aspirational rural India.Large public companies across sectors such as FMCG, auto, and fintech are already catering to some needs of rural India and capitalising on this opportunity.There are 10 large public companies making nearly 49 per cent (USD 35 billion-plus) revenue from rural, and each of them adopted a rural-first business model to cater to this segment.We are now seeing the emergence of startups with Bharat-focused business models. More than 50 such startups that are building for Bharat had raised USD 6.7 billion in funding by early 2023.Q: Are there specific sectors that are more promising? Where will we see faster growth in the next three-five years?A: Category wise, rural and urban consumers spend on similar things. However, while urban top 30 per cent spend twice as much on non-food segments (69 per cent) as food, the rural top 30 per cent of consumers spend equal amounts across food and non-food segments.This is pretty eye-opening - in the top 30 per cent rural households, 12 categories (five food, seven non-food) have an annual spend of USD 10 billion plus each, showing us many investable opportunities.Currently, we are excited about areas like commerce and healthcare for Bharat. Education and entertainment are the other two that seem very promising.In commerce, we are observing different models emerge -- kirana-led commerce, village-level entrepreneur-led commerce, rural house of brands -- across sub-categories such as fresh fruit and vegetables, grocery, lifestyle products, beauty and personal care and electronics.We have already invested in two grocery business models for T2/T3 cities and towns with Apnamart and Citymall, and are now looking for similar solutions in rural areas as well. In healthcare, we are seeing solutions being built around remote clinics, digitisation of pharmacies, generic medicines and secondary and tertiary care.There are several reasons for this trend playing out now. First, rural India is getting modernised in terms of both digital and physical infrastructure-internet penetration is high, reaching 350 million users, and 82 per cent of villages are now reachable by road.Second, rural consumers are getting exposed to urban brands and products via online content consumption through social media and Over the Top (OTT) platforms, which indicates that e-commerce adoption in rural India is expected to follow the e-commerce boom in tier-3 cities.Q: What are some of the key challenges that founders can face when building for rural India? A: Building for rural consumers can be tricky - consumers are widespread geographically,which means that population density is low, plus the average revenue one can earn per rural customer will be lower than that of an urban customer.So, founders need to solve for aspects like distribution costs and cost-effective customer acquisition.When it comes to distribution costs, supply chain optimisation should be an area of focus for founders while maintaining viable unit economics. With regard to cost-effective customer acquisition, founders need to have a very sharp focus on selecting their customer and high-value economic clusters (a top 30 percentile rural consumer spend similar to an average urban consumer that is nearly USD 1,000 annual per capita expenditure).There also tends to be a lack of in-depth understanding of the rural consumer. This is a high-trust community that is aspirational and time-rich. Founders need to stay customer-obsessed, and learn the nuances of this audience to fully grasp the painpoints of this target group. There is a Blue Ocean opportunity for startups building for rural Bharat's top 30 per cent -- there is immense potential for growth and innovation in this segment, which has yet to be fully explored.Q: What's your investment approach/philosophy? How has it changed over the past decade in India?A: On average, a bulk of our portfolio returns come from just a handful of investments. This is essentially the ""power law"" at work in the venture capital industry. So our investment approach is to find these outlier companies and back them as early in their journey as possible.A few such outlier examples from Accel's portfolio in India would be Flipkart, Freshworks andSwiggy - all of these were our early-stage bets.We believe in Accel's ""prepared mind"" approach to investing- this is a thesis-based method of investing wherein you research a space and know what large problem needs to be solved and then look for the best team building a solution for that problem."

72,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/has-the-interim-budget-set-the-ground-for-interest-rate-cuts-12210801.html,Has the interim budget set the ground for interest rate cuts?,"February 07, 2024 01:30 PM IST","At 6.5 percent, the policy repo rate is at its highest in nearly eight years. With the government presenting an unexpectedly prudent budget on February 1, could the RBI drop a hint on February 8 that rate cuts may be around the corner?","Exactly one week after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the interim budget for 2024-25, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das will announce the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) interest rate decision on February 8.While there is unlikely to be anything substantially new from a monetary policy perspective, the finance ministry may have given Das and his fellow rate-setters some food for thought.To be sure, no one really expects the RBI to actually lower the policy repo rate on February 8. In fact, it would be a huge surprise if even a single member of the MPC votes to cut interest rates this week. But an unexpectedly low fiscal deficit target of 5.1 percent of GDP for 2024-25 will not go unnoticed.""From the RBI's vantage point, the fiscal policy will likely be seen as complementing the monetary policy,"" Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi said.""While the RBI's MPC is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged on February 8, we expect the first steps to address tight frictional liquidity and a more active discussion on removing the tightening bias in the policy guidance,"" they added.Varma and Nandi see the first rate cut in August, with risks skewed towards the easing cycle beginning in June.Liquidity has indeed become an issue. While linked to the stance of monetary policy, the banking system's liquidity has been in 'withdrawal of accommodation' mode for the better part of two years now and has seemingly been fully withdrawn considering the weighted average call rate is above the repo rate and the RBI is conducting variable rate reverse repo auctions almost on a daily basis.""…the infusion of durable liquidity is becoming necessary, and idealistically, the monetary policy stance should change to 'neutral' from 'withdrawal of accommodation' to maintain consistency of stance and action,"" Soumyajit Niyogi, a director at India Ratings and Research's Core Analytical Group, said.Will the MPC then change its stance to neutral this week?If one goes by the RBI's inflation forecast, there may or may not be a case. Sure, the MPC finally does have visibility when it comes to its inflation target, with the central bank's latest forecasts seeing Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation hitting 4 percent in July-September, before rising to 4.7 percent in October-December.But a sustained reduction in inflation is what matters. As external member Ashima Goyal has previously said, a sequence of forecasts showing a sub-5 percent headline retail inflation would present an opportunity to reduce interest rates.Then there is core inflation. From as high as 6.1 percent in the first couple of months of 2023, retail inflation, excluding food and fuel items, had dropped dramatically to under 4 percent by the end of the calendar year.According to Soumya Kanti Ghosh, State Bank of India's group chief economic adviser, a ""behavioural shift"" – demand shifting from offline to online – may explain why core CPI inflation has fallen so steeply.""If this is sustained, the decline in core inflation could become more enduring in nature, opening up space for policy rate cuts,"" Ghosh said.Like Nomura's Varma and Nandi, Ghosh thinks August is the ""best bet"" for the first rate cut from the MPC, although he sees the possibility of it coming in June, too."

IEAs 2030 projections for Indian oil demand supply growth.The report comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India was heavily investing in the energy sector, emphasizing that the sector would get highest infrastructural push.The faster pace of oil consumption reflects the emergence of a burgeoning middle class, characterised by higher living standards and changing spending habits, IEA said, adding that as consumers become wealthier, they are more inclined to purchase energy-intensive big-ticket items such as cars and domestic appliances.India is set to maintain its position as a key exporter of transportation fuelsto markets in Asia and the Atlantic Basin, the agency noted and forecast new refining capacity to boost product supplies to global markets to 1.4 mb/d through mid-decade before edging lower to 1.2 mb/d by 2030 if the domestic demand holds steady.So far, India's oil marketing companies (OMCs) benefitted  from discounted Russian crude and significant inventory gains, offsetting the impact of unchanged retail prices of petrol and diesel. ""Over the next seven years, 1 mb/d of new refinery distillation capacity will be added – more than any other country in the world outside of China,"" IEA added.Oil demand strengthened by road transportAccording to the report, road transport leads the oil demand growth of the world's third-largest oil importer. The agency noted car ownerships in in India is limited and  low in international terms but the  size of the Indian car fleet is poised to grow more than 40 percent by 2030.Commenting on the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) among Indian consumers, IEA said it estimates that electrification will displace more than 200 kb/d of oil consumption by 2030, with about 70%coming from lower gasoline use.About 3.5 million EVs were registered in India by the end of 2023,according to data from the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.Meanwhile, IEA said that India’s total aviation activity and jet fuel requirements were roughly equal to those of France, leaving substantial potential for growth.Indian oil production on declineAccording to the report, output recorded in 2023 came at  just under700 kb/d, of which crude oil production was 600 kb/d, as compared to the peak of  over 900 kb/d in 2011.""The more supportive policy and investment regime, combined with favourable geology in recently opened and under explored areas, offers potential opportunities to bring on new supplies,"" IEA said."

""It had turned positive but now oil companies are losing close to Rs 3 per litre."" He said the profit margin on petrol has trimmed from low teens to around Rs 3-4 a litre.Asked about fuel price revision, Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri told reporters on the sidelines of the India Energy Week that the government does not dictate prices and the oil companies take their decision considering all economic aspects.""They say there is still volatility (in the market),"" he said.Asked about the bumper Rs 69,000 crore profits that the three firms have clocked in the first nine months of the current fiscal, he said the expectation would be to start price revision if the trend continues in the fourth and last quarter of the current fiscal year ending March 31.""They had losses when they voluntarily decided not to raise prices (despite oil prices going up),"" he said.The combined net profit of IOC, BPCL and HPCL in the April-December (first nine months of current fiscal year) was better than their annual earning of Rs 39,356 crore in pre-oil crisis year, regulatory filings by them showed.The firms had posted a combined net loss of Rs 21,201.18 crore during the April-September 2022 despite accounting for Rs 22,000 crore announced but not paid LPG subsidy for the previous two years. Subsequent softening of international prices and government giving out LPG subsidy helped IOC and BPCL post annualised profit for 2022-23 (April 2022 to March 2023 fiscal) but HPCL was in the red.This fiscal year, things have changed dramatically. The three firms posted record quarterly earnings in the first two quarters (April-June and July-September) when international oil prices - against which domestic rates are benchmarked - almost halved to USD 72 a barrel from a year ago. International prices rose again in the subsequent quarter to USD 90, leading to moderation of their earnings.But, on a year as a whole they had rich profits.The fuel price freeze that began on April 6, 2022, had a loss as high as Rs 17.4 a litre on petrol and Rs 27.7 per litre on diesel for the week ended June 24, 2022. However, subsequent softening led to losses being eliminated. The three firms had a margin of Rs 11 a litre on petrol and Rs 6 on diesel last month.But now things have changed, another industry official explained.International oil prices have been turbulent in the last couple of years. It dipped into the negative zone at the start of the pandemic in 2020 and swung wildly in 2022 - climbing to a 14-year high of nearly USD 140 per barrel in March 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine, before sliding on weaker demand from top importer China and worries of an economic contraction.But for a nation that is 85 per cent dependent on imports, the spike meant adding to already elevated levels of inflation and derailing the economic recovery from the pandemic.So the three fuel retailers froze petrol and diesel prices for the longest duration in the last two decades. They stopped daily price revision in early November 2021 when rates across the country hit an all-time high, prompting the government to roll back a part of the excise duty hike it had effected during the pandemic to take advantage of low oil prices.The freeze continued into 2022 but the war-led spike in international oil prices prompted a Rs 10 a litre hike in petrol and diesel prices from mid-March 2022 before another round of excise duty cut rolled back all of the Rs 13 a litre and Rs 16 a litre increase in taxes on petrol and diesel done during the pandemic.That followed the current price freeze that began on April 6, 2022 and still continues."

Grand-sounding plans, such as encouraging state-backed enterprises to buy stocks, and government pledges to stabilise markets, aren't doing much to boost confidence. A key equity index sank to a five-year low on Friday. On the whole, initiatives have been cautious and vague. Muddling through seems to be the objective. Absent a decisive shift by the Fed, China has limited room to maneuver, in part because officials fear pronounced weakness in their currency, the yuan. The People’s Bank of China can make the odd cut in borrowing costs, but the effect is likely to be muted.Punitive regulatory measures, such as tightening trading restrictions on institutional investors, will only sap confidence.Happily, this is likely to change in coming months. Despite the market’s dour view of Powell’s television interview with 60 Minutes, the Fed’s message hasn’t materially changed: Inflation is retreating, hikes are done and reductions are coming this year. The Sunday night audience was different from that which typically parses every sentence, comma and inflection of Fed speak. The broad thrust of what Powell said was similar to that of his press conference after last week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. Powell told CBS he wasn’t fretting about China, his first public comments on the disappointing recovery in some time. “As long as what happens in China doesn’t lead to significant disruptions in the economy or the financial system, then the implications for the United States — we may feel them a bit, but they shouldn’t be that large,” he said.Powell may not be too concerned, but he has devoted followers across the Pacific. The PBOC recently offered some revealing insights into its thinking about the Fed and how actions in DC may shape the response to challenges at home. The bank lowered the amount of reserves lenders are required to hold by a larger-than-anticipated amount, and did so on a Thursday during a rare afternoon news conference by central bank Governor Pan Gongsheng. Normally, these type of announcements dribble on a Friday evening , via dry statements on the bank's website.But more interesting were Pan's remarks about what Powell can do for China. The narrowing of divergent policies between the world’s two-largest economies “will expand space for China’s monetary policy operations,” he said. That's a polite way of saying that when the Fed cuts, or convinces people it will do so soon, China has more scope to be aggressive. Policy has been going in different directions for the world's two pivotal economies in the past couple of years: The Fed aggressively raised rates in 2022 and 2023, but has said its prepared to ease this year.Arguments are raging in market circles about when this might occur; some investors latched onto March, and might well be disappointed. In the general scheme of things, it matters not whether it occurs in April or June. That it happens is consequential. Pan has clearly been listening. He's also worried about deflation, conceding that inflation is a long way from target. Actually, there isn’t any; consumer prices slipped again in December, marking the longest slide since 2009.  Pan’s predecessor Yi Gang once said 2 percent inflation is a central banker’s dream. By that metric, Pan is wrestling with insomnia.Why would America's greatest strategic and economic rival be so candid about what things in DC can do for them? At least part of the answer lies in the currency market. Beijing has been contending with a fragile yuan. The currency lost almost 6 percent against the dollar last year, one of the worst performances in Asia. Though the government is fine with some depreciation to reflect fundamentals, it doesn't want a collapse. It’s the pace that matters, not the absolute level. If China is to make the yuan a proper global currency, stability matters. That has argued against a powerful easing. Better to wait until Fed easing weighs on the dollar.The two nations are often said to be moving in radically different directions, with China emphasising the primacy of the state, and cracking down on everything from education companies to technology, even consulting firms.The world's biggest economies are, however, intertwined in ways few foreign-policy pundits or industrial wonks would have us believe. Don't just take my word for it. Pan let a few secrets of the temple out. If this coming step-up in stimulus works, it will be stamped Made in the USA.Daniel Moss is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist.

Cognizant said discretionary spending by clients has still not picked up.The poor show, though expected, points towards the continuing overall weak demand environment for IT companies.Though a US-based company, Cognizant's performance reflects overall market sentiment for IT service companies in India such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, and Wipro. These companies, in turn, have majority of their clients based in the US and Europe.While the company had guided for a decline of 4 to 1.2 percent for the quarter, its revenue fell 2.4 percent in constant currency terms. Sequentially, revenue decreased by 2.9 percent.The company's net profit increased by over 7 percent to $558 million YoY in the fourth quarter. The New Jersey-based company, whose employees are majorly based in India, follows calendar year.For the full year 2023, the IT major posted a 0.4 percent YoY decline in revenue at $19.4 billion. In constant currency terms, it was 0.3 percent lower.Cognizant has given a guidance of $4.68-$4.76 billion for Q1FY24, which translates to a decline of 2.7 percent to 1.2 percent.""Our guidance range is broader because we do not know what we do not know,"" Kumar said while addressing analysts after declaring the results. ""But our thesis is very simple, we are going to be prepared for a comeback of discretionary,"" Kumar added.For 2024, the company has guided for a revenue of $19-$19.8 billion, which translates to a decline of 1.8 percent to a growth of 2.2 percent. Last year, while reporting its Q4 earnings, Cognizant did not provide a full year guidance. For 2022, the company had pegged the full year guidance at $20-20.5 billion.Despite acquisitions contributing to about $200 million to topline, Cognizant provided an anaemic guidance.CEO Ravi Kumar S, who has been at the helm for a year, said the company delivered its Q4 revenue within the guided range, maintaining its commercial momentum.“If you dissect our guidance, you would see that there is a certain sequential growth that we have assumed during the course of the year. But environment remains uncertain, and it's certainly a slower start to the year,” Jatin Dalal, the new chief financial officer said.The IT major’s adjusted operating margin rose 190 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 16.1 percent.Bookings for the quarter stood at a record $26.3 billion on a trailing-twelve-month basis, up 9 percent year-on-year.Kumar explained that the proportion of large deals was lower in 2022 compared to 2023. ""Now that we're entering 2024, what we won in 2023 will contribute to 2024, it did contribute to 2023, but it will contribute more in 2024 and it will create a backlog for the future,"" Kumar said.Vertical playRevenue from the financial services vertical decreased by 5.8 percent to $1.395 billion. This is the first time in 30 years of Cognizant’s history when revenue from the financial services vertical is trailing the health sciences business.Revenue from the health sciences vertical declined by 2.1 percent YoY to $1.396 billion in the fourth quarter. This is not because health sciences division grew faster, but because the financial services shrank faster by 6% YoY and the health sciences division shrinking by 2% in the same period.During 2023, three leaders from the Financial Services vertical quit the company. Meera Krishnamurthy, who was the head of banking and financial services, was one amongst the several big-wigs who exited the company.Kumar said the financial services vertical churns out a higher number of discretionary deals. And because the sector carries the burden of high interest rates, it is leading clients to a wait-and-watch scenario, thereby pausing discretionary work.""Let's see how the industry (financial services) shapes up in the year. And normally what I have seen based on the experience is, if there are one or two repeatable cycles of interest rate adjustments downwards, we will start to see the spend coming back,"" Kumar said.Revenue from the Products and Resources vertical increased by 3.1 percent to $1.2 billion for the quarter under consideration.Employee metricsThe company saw its headcount increase by 1,100 sequentially, ending with 347,700 employees in 2023. Attrition fell by 11.8 percentage points to 13.8 percent on a trailing twelve-month basis.Back in India, IT services companies have seen a steady decline in headcount. India’s top three IT companies have reported a reduction of 16,254 employees cumulatively in the third quarter of FY24, amid an uncertain demand environment.In Q1, Cognizant kicked off a cost-cutting programme called NextGen, as part of which it planned to cut 3,500 jobs as well as give up 11 million sq ft in office space primarily in large Indian cities and moving to smaller cities — incurring a cost of $350 million as part of this ($150 million in employee separation costs and $200 million in facility exit and other costs).In 2023, it has so far incurred $229 million, consisting of $115 million in employee separation costs, $108 million in facility exit costs, and $6 million in third-party and other costs.Generative AIThe company said 88,000 of its employees have completed artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI courses.Cognizant currently has over 250 early engagements that incorporate the use of generative AI, and another 350 are in the pipeline. ""We aim to infuse AI, not only into our core offerings but into everything we do, including using generative AI to create industry and functional services,"" Kumar said.Although, consumer use of generative AI is starting to explore, enterprise use cases have been ramping slowly, Kumar told analysts. However, the company expects the pace of enterprise adoption to pick up soon, and after a slow takeoff, the movement of the curve will be accelerate sharply, he said.""Our research also predicts that 90% of the jobs will be disrupted in some way by this technology,"" Kumar said.From 2023-2032, the percent of jobs with high exposure scores, meaning the degree to which an occupation will be affected by generative AI could increase from 8% to 52%, he further said. Setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work, productivity and economic growth."

Businesses replied that CPI inflation may end 2024 at 4.96 percent, 23 basis points higher than their prediction of 4.73 percent in October 2023.One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.Also Read: Revenue Secretary Malhotra sees no reason to cut fuel excise""Overall, the firms are expecting increasing cost pressures,"" Abhiman Das, professor of economics at IIM-A, who conducts the survey, said.As per the results of the survey, one-third of the firms polled think costs have increased significantly - or by more than 6 percent - up from 29 percent in the previous round of the survey. At the same time, the fraction of firms reporting 'moderate cost increase' - or 3.1 percent to 6.0 percent - remained around 29 percent. IIM-Ahmedabad's Business Inflation Expectations SurveyThe results of the survey - which has become an important input in monetary policy decisions - comes just ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) interest rate decision. The Indian central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) began its three-day meeting on February 6 and will announce its interest rate decision at 10am on February 8. The rate-setting panel is largely expected to maintain the policy repo rate at 6.5 percent for the sixth meeting in a row.The BIES largely polls manufacturing firms. The latest round of the survey, the 80th in the series, is based on responses mostly received in the second half of January.The rise in inflation expectations of firms comes amid prices rising at a quicker pace. In December, headline retail inflation rose to a four-month high of 5.69 percent, although the increase was less than expectations of 5.9 percent. Meanwhile, Wholesale Price Index (WPI) inflation - which businesses face - rose to a nine-month high of 0.73 percent in December.Unlike CPI inflation, WPI inflation was subdued for much of 2023, only rising above zero in November. It is expected to rise further in the coming months.Retail and wholesale inflation data for January is set to be released on February 12 and February 14, respectively. As per the RBI's latest forecast, CPI inflation is seen falling to 4 percent in July-September 2024 before rising to 4.7 percent in October-December 2024.Inflation expectations are keenly eyed by policymakers, as anchoring them is critical to ensuring price stability. On December 8, the MPC said monetary policy ""must continue to be actively disinflationary to ensure anchoring of inflation expectations and fuller transmission"".The IIM-A survey is one of only two surveys conducted in India to measure inflation expectations. The other is the RBI's Inflation Expectations Survey of Households. The latest round of the survey, released on December 8, showed that while three-month-ahead inflation expectations of households were steady in November 2023 at 9.1 percent, the one-year-ahead expectations were up 20 basis points at 10.1 percent.While cost pressures have risen for manufacturing firms, sales expectations have also improved significantly, with about 57 percent of surveyed firms reporting 'normal' or greater sales in December 2023, up from 46 percent in November 2023.""Overall, the profit margins expectations have also improved. Around 48 percent of the firms in December 2023 are reporting profit margins to be 'about normal' or greater – significantly up from 43 percent reported in November 2023,"" Abhiman Das added.The survey measures 'normal' as the average of the preceding three years, excluding the Covid-19 period."

This, according to government officials, will help the central government meet its medium-term objective of lowering the deficit to 4.5 percent or below by 2025-26.However, Fitch has expressed doubt over the government's target.""We still think it will be challenging for the government to achieve its 2025-26 deficit target,"" it said.""Trade-offs between economic growth and consolidation are likely to become more acute in the coming years, and we expect the government to maintain a core focus on economic growth outcomes, particularly by sustaining strong capex. Meanwhile, the slow pace of the fiscal consolidation process in the wake of the pandemic could leave India's public finances exposed in the event of further major economic shocks,"" it added.The Indian government has been in a running battle with global ratings agencies – S&P Global Ratings, Moody's Investors Services, and Fitch – as it thinks that the lowest investment grade rating assigned to the country is not a fair reflection of its economic strength. In a post-Budget interview to Moneycontrol, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran said that while the government would welcome a ratings upgrade, it was not ""chasing"" one.Fitch analysts, who affirmed the BBB- rating on India with stable outlook on January 16, also said that while the fiscal deficit target for 2024-25 pointed at a ""slightly faster"" pace of consolidation than expected, the targets are ""broadly in line"" with the agency's assumptions when it affirmed its rating on India.""As such, they are unlikely to lead to significant changes in the sovereign's credit profile, although this modestly reduces near-term risks to the fiscal trajectory and signals the government's commitment to its fiscal consolidation plans,"" they said.According to Fitch, India's general government fiscal deficit – Centre plus states combined – is seen at 8.6 percent of GDP in 2023-24. This, it said, is high relative to other countries in the 'BBB' rating category, where the median figure was 3.5 percent of GDP in 2023.In terms of the stock of public debt, Fitch thinks the government's focus on cutting the deficit will help to ""slightly"" reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. It expects the ratio to fall slightly over the next five years to just above 80 percent assuming a continued decline in the fiscal deficit and robust nominal growth of around 10.5 percent.Commenting broadly on the budget, Fitch said that as it was an interim one ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, further clarity on the fiscal plans of the new government will only be available later. However, it expects the fiscal deficit target to be maintained in the full Budget, which will likely be presented in July if the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party government returns to power. Fitch thinks this is likely to happen.On capex, Fitch expects the higher target of Rs 11.11 lakh crore for 2024-25 to remain supportive of growth, which it sees moderating to 6.5 percent from 7.3 percent in 2023-24.""We believe India is well-placed to sustain higher rates of growth in the medium term relative to many of its peers, with the capex drive helping to underpin this view,"" it said."

Together, the Big Three returned more than $80 billion to shareholders last year, up from $78 billion in 2022 despite lower oil and gas prices, lower refining margins and fewer trading opportunities","Big Oil has delivered a set of remarkable earnings. Without fanfare, ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Shell Plc all did in the fourth quarter what they’d promised: Start new oil and gas projects; cut costs; return lots of money to shareholders. It’s a model for the notoriously boom-and-bust industry.Together, the three companies at the top of the global energy industry returned more than $80 billion to shareholders last year, up from $78 billion in 2022 despite lower oil and gas prices, lower refining margins and fewer trading opportunities.The cash gusher cemented the companies as one of the stock market’sbiggest payers, trailing only the big tech companies. On the basis of dividends and share buybacks, Exxon and Chevron were last year among the top-10 payers in the S&P 500 Index. The only two other industrial companies among the 10 largest were drug giant Johnson & Johnson and military behemoth RTX Corp.Now, Big Oil needs to turn that feat into a recurring event – without the help of another energy crisis. Financial acumen, rather than geopolitical upheaval, will be key. So, it would be sticking to the plan that has tentatively attracted anew some investors previously disenchanted with Big Oil: focus on return on capital employed. On average, that measure was in double digits for the trio for the second consecutive year in 2023.But let’s face it, the industry would need to do that quarter after quarter after quarter for the foreseeable future. Investor scepticism shows in their market valuation. Take Exxon. On a price-to-book ratio, it’s trading at just two times, well below the three-to-four times of its golden era in the early 2000s, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Chevron and Shell are trading at even lower levels.And Big Oil still doesn’t have many allies in Wall Street, and certainly even fewer in the greener City of London. In the climate-crisis era, Fossil Fuel Inc needs to shower shareholders with money just to keep investors onside.From the sound of it, industry chief executives get it. Last week, they mentioned the word “plan” 31 times on their post-earnings conference calls – the fourth highest number of mentions in 25 years, according to Bloomberg data. Exxon CEO Darren Woods was paradigmatic. In quick succession, he told shareholders Exxon would go “forward into the plan”; it’s already “on that plan”; and, in some areas, “ahead of our plans.”What’s the plan exactly? To my mind, it’s a three-fold endeavour. First, run the assets well. The simplest dollar earned in the oil industry is that coming from running an oilfield, refinery or chemical plant as close as possible to 100% of the time. Downtime is bad business. That doesn’t mean compromising on safety. The opposite is true: preventive maintenance can save money avoiding, more costly failures. Running the assets well has a broader meaning: deliver new projects on schedule.Second, keep a tight leash on capital expenditures. Over the last two years, Big Oil has done a good job reducing capex compared to the heyday of the early 2000s. Yet, more recently, capex has been running slightly above guidance. Exxon is a big culprit. The company argues it spent more because it saw great opportunities. Perhaps, but investors have heard that before – and it didn’t end well. Stephen Richardson, an analyst at Evercore Inc, had suggested a good approach to Exxon’s capital spending, which can be applied across all of Big Oil. It echoes the Cold War’s motto of nuclear disarmament: Investors should trust the company’s spending, but also verify that the promised returns are delivered.Third, operational spending needs to continue to decline, if possible, ahead of schedule. Opex, as it's known, grabs far less attention than capex. Yet, it’s more important because any savings tend to be long-lasting. The problem is that saving money from day-to-day spending isn’t easy, and involves mundane measures like telling staffers to print in black-and-white, rather than colour. Ungratifying as it is, it would keep free cash for paying shareholders, particularly if oil and gas prices drop further in 2024 and 2025. Opex control would be even more important for Exxon and Chevron as both digest big acquisitions (Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Hess Corp, respectively) where synergies depend a lot on reducing overlapping day-to-day spending.The stuff of the next 12 or 24 months isn’t flashy. It isn’t about $150-a-barrel oil, sky-high gas prices or another convulsion in the Middle East or Russia. It’s about becoming a boring cash machine.

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. Bharti Airtel's shares gained 3 percent in the first half of trading on Tuesday after it reported a healthy performance in its India business. Revenues increased 11 percent, helped by tariff hikes and improved realisations. “The company see(s) two catalysts boosting its Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) growth. First, it actively implements tariff hikes. Second, an increasing proportion of high-value 4G/5G customers contribute to this growth,” writes Nitin Agrawal in Airtel’s December quarter results analysis piece.Yet, Airtel is unlikely to see major upgrades in earnings estimates due to forex pressures in the Africa business. Airtel’s results partly mimic broader trends in the Nifty 50 index. The aggregate Nifty 50 consensus earnings estimates continue to trend downwards.As per Jefferies India Nifty consensus earnings estimates for FY24 and FY25 have been cut by 1.1 percent and 1 percent respectively during the results season. In an interim review note, Motilal Oswal Financial Services said its Nifty EPS FY24 and FY25 estimates saw modest cuts.An analysis of the results of 33 Nifty companies shows operating profits outpacing sales, reflecting stable profitability. However, sales growth is yet to gather pace in a big way. The IT services industry is a case in point.In fact, as per Motilal a significant chunk of Nifty’s incremental earnings accretion is driven by a group of five companies and reflects uneven earnings performance in the benchmark index.One may take solace from the FY24 Nifty consensus earnings growth estimate of 16 percent, which looks decent in a slowing global economy. But earnings growth is out of sync with valuations. Importantly, earnings upgrades, the key drivers of the market returns are still missing at the aggregate level.That said, companies outside the Nifty seem to be delivering better earnings performance. The Nifty Midcap 100 index saw marginal earnings upgrades for FY24 and FY25 compared to cuts in Nifty 50. While this is reflected in the superior performance of the Nifty Midcap index on the stock exchanges, investors should be wary of a sharp run-up in stock prices as they may already discount the impact of these upgrades.Investing insights from our research teamWill the BSE stock price mirror Q3 FY24 earnings show?Mphasis: Not yet out of the woods, unfavourable risk-reward ratioBharat Electronics: Improving visibility, earnings to support stockSAMHI Hotels: Better profitability, balance sheet strength to sustain re-ratingVarun Beverages: Capacity addition to drive growthSRF: Last leg of inventory rationalisation provides an opportunityIn case you missed itMC Pro Election 2024 Portfolio: You can bet on these 14 select stocks to play the election themeTrackerPro Economic Tracker | Auto sales improve, active workforce declinesWhat else are we reading?Take a bow Madam Finance Minister and team North Block for a responsible BudgetWhat’s behind the rally in PSU stocksDoes the consumption of the poor really matter?When trading in commodities, learn to think out of the boxChart of the Day: Mankind Pharma’s focus on chronic therapy drugs is yielding growth benefitsWhy road construction firms are on a slippery terrainDo PLI schemes work best standalone or as part of a comprehensive manufacturing strategy?For a healthy Indian economy, reforms in public healthcare delivery are a mustMarketing Musings: A tale of two festsChina’s growth enigma (republished from the FT)RBI's Paytm freeze shows faulty understandingThe game-changing ambition of Pradhanmantri Suryodaya YojanaRs 1 lakh crore ‘Anusandhan’ scheme’s offer of long-term capital is the 1991 moment for AI development in IndiaClimate Change: California atmospheric river and Chile fires are just the beginningEV Technology: The US should copy China’s playbookTechnical Picks: M&M, Cipla, Apollo Tyres, SAIL and Mentha oil (These are published every trading day before markets open and can be read on the app).R Sree RamMoneycontrol Pro  "

Capacity woes, high costs may mean a missed market for the PSU.","Power Grid Corp of India is expected to record a modest on-year growth in Q3 revenue on slow capacity build-up, while its net profit may fall because of a rise in transmission costs. The company is set to announce its Q3 FY24 results on February 7.The PSU power transmission company is expected to see its fiscal third quarter revenue grow 2 percent on-year to Rs 11,811 crore, according to an average of three brokerage estimates. Net profit is expected to fall 0.9 percent to Rs 3,612 crore, according to estimates.Earlier, in Q2FY24, state-run power transmission firm reported a 4 percent on-year increase in net profit to Rs 3,781.42 crore, while its total income for the same period grew 1.6 percent on-year to Rs 11,530 crore.Power generation buoyant in Q3, but capacity shortage may have hit Power GridAccording to brokerages, power generation remained buoyant in Q3FY24 on the back of surging demand during the festive season. “Rising power demand, widening peak deficit, incremental renewables addition, the requirement to add incremental thermal capacity (as peak shortages increase) and expansion into new ventures (pumped storage and green hydrogen) are some key drivers for the sector, an Elara Securities report said.Power Grid has 12 ‘buy’ calls against five ‘sell’ and four ‘hold’ calls at present. Analysts at Elara Securities said in a recent note that India’s transmission capex is progressing at a slower pace. Further, private sector participation in transmission is higher, adding to the competition.“Power Grid Corporation's (PGCIL) work-in-hand has remained stagnant at Rs 500,000 crore since FY2020 and much lower than the peak in FY2016. While work in hand may grow, project conceptualisation, award and conversion to earnings may take a long time,” said the note.Also read: Energy Budget: Power PSUs get 17% more budgetary allocationPressure on Power Grid margins on higher costsJM Financial analysts also expect Power Grid to report a “flattish quarter” with net sales at Rs 11,500 crore, and an EBITDA margin decline of 156 bps to 86 percent. JM Financial has a buy call with a target price of Rs 235.In a November 2023, Q2 earnings report, Elara analysts maintained a ‘reduce’ call on the stock as they saw limited earnings growth due to low capex and capitalization. In the Q2FY24 earnings call, the company mentioned that the cumulative Capex in the 1st half of the year was Rs 4,246 crores against the yearly target of Rs 8,800 crore.Also read: Power Grid board approves raising Rs 2,200 crore via bondsOn the other hand, Bank of Baroda Capital analysts maintained a ‘buy’ call on Power Grid in a November 2023 report. They assigned a target price of Rs 210 ""given its superior ROE and lowest risk profile within the power sector"".Jefferies continues to have a ‘buy’ call on Power Grid with a target price of Rs 270.As of February 3, the Power Grid stock was trading at Rs 270. Over the last one year, the stock has gained 72 percent and gained over 180 percent over the last five years. It has beaten the NSE Nifty 50, which has gained 23.3 percent during the year.Power Grid Corporation is a Schedule ‘A’, Maharatna company which operates under the Ministry of Power (with 51.34 percent government holding) and is engaged in bulk transmission of power.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management. Moneycontrol.com advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions."
272,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/indirect-taxes-in-the-journey-of-indias-economic-growth-12204571.html,Indirect taxes in the journey of India’s economic growth,"February 06, 2024 03:07 PM IST",Indirect taxes have played an important role in contributing towards the economic development by replacing a fragmented indirect tax system,"The Vote-on-Account presented on Thursday by the Finance Minister, is an interim budget before the General Elections. A full-fledged budget is likely to be presented by the new Cabinet, possibly in July, following the conclusion of the election. The Finance Minister’s speech highlighted the advancements made by the Indian economy, progressing rapidly towards the goal of $5 trillion in the next three years and attaining the status of the third largest economy in the world.In her budget speech, the Finance Minister attributed GST as one of the key elements for people-centric inclusive development. The “one nation, one market, one tax” agenda has helped in expanding taxpayers’ base and increasing tax collections. She mentioned that there has been an increase in the revenue of states, post introduction of GST, which has led to an overall growth in the economy. Consumers have also benefitted from GST, with removal of cascading effects due to multiple indirect taxes, resulting in reduction of prices of goods and services.According to data released on 31 January, GST collections for January 2024 rank the second highest since July 2017, yet another macro indicator of the health of the economy.A survey conducted by Deloitte providing insights into the sixth year of GST, was referred to by the Finance Minister in her speech. This survey invited views from the industry which acknowledged the government's proactive measures to simplify compliance that played a crucial role in the efficient adoption of the GST. The survey reflected a positive outlook towards ease of doing business in India with enhanced supply-chain efficiencies, working capital rationalisation, input cost reduction, etc. Continued focus on simpler and more efficient tax technology initiatives were also optimistically received. The survey results showed that while large taxpayers have been able to adapt to the technology tools introduced in GST, MSMEs have been facing challenges in e-invoicing and matching requirements for availing input credits.Ambiguity regarding the application of the Input Service Distributor (ISD) and cross-charge mechanism have been resolved in the budget, with the amendment of the relevant provisions of GST law making ISD mechanism mandatory on a prospective basis. This is in line with the recommendations by the GST Council in recent meetings.Measures have been taken under Customs to reduce the time taken for clearance of goods where the import release time at inland container depots have declined by 47 percent to 71 hours, air cargo complexes by 28 percent to 44 hours and sea ports by 27 percent to 85 hours. Leading to supply chain optimisation. Changes with respect to lowering of Customs duties on mobile phone components, extension of Customs duty concessions on lithium-ion cells for mobile phone, were recently made to provide the smartphone industry the ability to import components at lower rates and help this industry play a larger role globally.Industry had expectations that an amnesty scheme could probably be introduced under Customs law to reduce litigation and for the digitalization of the Customs litigation processes, etc. These expectations may be taken up in the full budget to be presented after the elections.Indirect taxes have played a pivotal role in contributing towards the economic development of India where a fragmented indirect tax system has been replaced. Compliances could be made simpler as there are sections (MSMEs and smaller players) who find rules tough to maneuver and to ease doing business in India.Saloni Roy is Partner, Deloitte India.

The Chinese economy grew by 5.2 per cent last year, according to official statistics. But for many in business, it probably did not feel like that from the evidence on the streets of Beijing and other large cities.

The ophthal (ophthalmology) and onco (oncology) line has a few approvals. And we should be hitting the market in the next few quarters for one after the other products,” said CFO, R K Baheti, in an interaction with Moneycontrol. Alembic Pharmaceuticals reported a 48 per cent increase in its consolidated net profit to Rs 180 crore for the third quarter ended December 2023, due to robust sales across domestic and export markets.He added that approvals and inspections at various facilities were in limbo till a few quarters ago due to COVID. “Product approvals are now coming thick and fast,” Baheti added. Despite the multiple product launches, Alembic Pharma does not foresee additional capital expenditure for these initiatives, and annual research and development (R&D) expenses are expected to remain around Rs 500 crore, according to the company's management.In a strategic move, the management aims to focus on promoting new-generation products with growth potential over legacy products. Baheti highlighted the intention to shift focus from products like the antibiotic Althrocin, where Alembic currently holds a dominant market share, to newer antibiotic molecules such as Azithromycin, where there is more room to grow.During an analyst call, the management disclosed its ongoing efforts in the development of GLP-1 products, leveraging the company's peptide capability. GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs, primarily used in treating type 2 diabetes, have gained popularity for their weight-loss properties.Also read: Budget allocates Rs 90,658 crore to health ministry, reflecting a 12.5% increaseThe Vadodra-based pharma manufacturer had 11 new launches in the third quarter in the US generics market and received US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) approvals on eight of its Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the third quarter of FY24. The US ex-generics market saw a 32 percent growth in the quarter. On the issue of price erosion, Baheti said that the issue depends on various factors including the number of players in a market and said that the company is focusing more on things it can control like regulatory compliance.What analysts thinkWhile maintaining a neutral rating on Alembic, Motilal Oswal anticipates a 16 percent earnings compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the period from FY24 to FY26. This growth is expected to be driven by a strong performance in the company's core markets, specifically drug formulations (DF) and exports. Analysts highlighted the company's controlled research and development (R&D) spending, as well as its improved operating leverage.HSBC analysts observed that new product launches and an uptick in supplies from new plants are poised to boost US sales. They also expect gradual accrual of benefits from the newly established plants.Alembic Pharma operates in diverse therapeutic segments with the anti-infective segment contributing significantly to domestic revenue, while the USA remains a major revenue source in the export market.Also read: Health sector to benefit from focus on public healthcare"

It said the situation has not changed much even in January 2024.“The demand environment is not getting any better, which is why it is very hard to say in terms of how the business will shape up going forward,” Birlasoft CEO Angan Guha told Moneycontrol.Demand has remained subdued for almost all IT firms as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty and anticipations of a recession in key markets.For October-December, the Pune-based company’s consolidated profit rose by over 11 percent sequentially to Rs 161 crore. Revenue from operations grew by about 2.5 percent to Rs 1,342.5 crore quarter-on-quarter.On the profitability side, the company said its operating margin will stay in the current 14 percent mark in the near term. This is because the company is investing in technology and to hire teams across the board.Additionally, Guha said utilisation levels at 87 percent in the October-December quarter is at the optimal level. This implies utilisation rates will not go over and above the present levels.Utilisation refers to the percentage of billable hours that employees are actively working on client projects.Reducing smaller clientsGuha said the company has been actively reducing its number of active customers who are not generating significant revenues. “When you take that resource or capability out and invest in the larger accounts, you will more than make up right for the revenue loss in the small accounts,” he said.The company will continue to invest in its top 100 accounts, Guha added.As of quarter ended December, the IT services exporter reduced its active clients by 6 sequentially to 272. Year-on-year, active number of clients decreased by 27.Guha said ambiguity exists as to how the company’s top clients will perform in the coming quarters, adding that it is “wait and watch” scenario for the company.Generative AIGuha said Birlasoft aims to use Gen AI first in the company itself to gauge the effectiveness of its models in driving productivity. The company has about 30 Gen AI use-cases deployed internally, Guha said.Although external customer engagement is underway with 30-40 active use cases, Guha acknowledged that Gen AI is yet to translate into tangible revenue for the company."

This followed a 3.2 percent decline in 2020-21 - the year that was hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.""Due to Covid pandemic, there had been a marginal fall in employment in 2020-21 which was more than compensated in the subsequent year i.e. in 2021-22 with total estimated employment in the sector showing a robust growth of 7.0 percent year-on-year,"" the statistics ministry said in a statement late on February 5.Also Read: More informed debate on job situation needed, says FM Sitharaman""In fact, the estimated number of persons engaged in this sector in 2021-22 has exceeded the pre-pandemic level (that is 2018-19) by more than 9.35 lakh,"" it added.While the number of persons engaged in Indian industries did indeed exceed the pre-pandemic level in 2021-22, the growth over a longer period has been rather anaemic, with the average annual growth over the four-year period starting 2018-19 at just 2.5 percent.YearNumber of People EngagedYoY GrowthFY181.56 croreFY191.63 crore4.3%FY201.66 crore2.1%FY211.61 crore-3.2%FY221.72 crore7.0%The Annual Survey of Industries covers factories with 10 or more workers if using electricity for any manufacturing processes or 20 or more workers if they don't use electricity. Further, the survey also looks at bidi and cigar manufacturing establishments registered under the Bidi & Cigar Workers (Conditions of Employment) Act of 1966, electricity undertakings engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity but not registered with the Central Electricity Authority, units with 100 or more employees registered in states' Business Register of Establishments.In contrast to the subdued employment growth, the government's survey found that Gross Value Added (GVA) of the factories increased by 26.6 percent in 2021-22 and 8.8 percent in 2020-21.

India must roll back tariff increases, reduce local manufacturing mandates, and ease price controls that hinder trade, while the US must re-authorise the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme and review tariffs on Indian steel and alumnium imports","US-India goods trade is falling at a time when American firms are purportedly looking to diversify supply chains. However, India is not alone. US goods trade with most of its largest trade partners has declined. India’s goods trade with the world is declining as well. But the drop of trade with India is particularly sharp.The high degree of concentration of US exports in a few categories – namely hydrocarbons, gold and gems has proven to be a significant determinant. Hitting the oft stated $500 billion trade target will be difficult if the countries continue to over-rely on a handful of sectors for the bulk of our trade. In 2024, leaders from both countries should push hard to diversify the bilateral trade basket.India has firmly planted itself as a top-10 goods trade partner to the United States with over $123b in two-way trade over the last twelve months. The United States is India’s top goods trade partner. Economic interdependence is growing due to the countries’ respective market sizes and economic growth patterns. Supply chain concerns stemming from Covid-19 disruptions and growing concerns about the China-centered security challenges have prompted a widening array of firms to look at supply chain alternatives.US-India Goods Trade: A Narrow Trade BasketDespite this, both nations have seen recent drops in goods trade. India’s goods trade with the world fell by about 4.7 percent in the past year to $1.1 trillion. America’s goods trade is also declining marginally, with total trade falling in the past year with eight of its 10 largest goods trade partners. However, goods trade with India fell particularly sharply – down 8 percent year-on-year – only behind China (-17 percent) and Vietnam (-12 percent). American exports to India were hit particularly hard, dropping 15 percent year-on-year.Digging into the sectoral data from both the United States and Indian governments, a pattern is apparent. US exports to India are over-reliant on a few sectors.Petroleum, coal, diamonds, natural gas, and gold collectively make up 40 percent of total US exports. Of these five sectors, Indian imports are down across-the-board in all except gold. While the Indian Rupee has declined during this period, the two percent decline is not nearly enough to account for the dollar decline in trade.Both governments are prioritising increases in “strategic trade,” the narrow-yet-crucial sectors that will power our future economies. This includes areas like new and renewable energy, semiconductors, defense manufacturing, and more. Achieving policy changes and commercial success in these areas will help. But finding ways to improve bilateral trade in more mundane areas like consumer goods, chemicals, and agriculture products has proven much more difficult.For policymakers, the indication is clear. Leaders in Washington and New Delhi need to work hard in 2024 to diversify goods trade.Liberalising Trade Amid ElectionsElections present both challenges and opportunities in this regard. India is expected to have a national election in April-May. A newly elected government with a fresh mandate can hopefully push to reverse some anti-trade decisions of recent years by rolling back tariff increases, reducing local manufacturing mandates, and easing price controls and other domestic restrictions that act as unofficial trade barriers. India should also do a deeper assessment of the types of tariff reductions on input goods that can have a stimulative effect on India’s ability to attract manufacturing investments.The United States should also have a clear agenda. Congress should move to re-authorise the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme, and the Biden administration should leverage this to remove restrictions on India. The 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from India and other nations had adverse effects.Taking steps to liberalise trade during an election year can be tricky. However, with rolling election schedules in both nations, allowing leaders to hide behind the excuse of elections will endemically stymie trade policy progress.The fact that petroleum, coal, and natural gas all rank among America’s top exports also presents a difficult juxtaposition for an administration that is pursuing decarbonisation globally. If the Biden administration’s programs are successful, the over-reliance of US exports to India in these sectors will face acute threats in the future.The reasons for deeper US-India economic integration are obvious. Both nations have large and growing economies, large populations, and increasing concerns about the security of over-reliance on China as the globe’s manufacturing hub. Growing and diversifying trade is mutually reinforcing and can prepare us for potential shocks from over-reliance on key sectors.Richard M.

It said the situation has not changed much even in January 2024.“The demand environment is not getting any better, which is why it is very hard to say in terms of how the business will shape up going forward,” Birlasoft CEO Angan Guha told Moneycontrol.Demand has remained subdued for almost all IT firms as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty and anticipations of a recession in key markets.For October-December, the Pune-based company’s consolidated profit rose by over 11 percent sequentially to Rs 161 crore. Revenue from operations grew by about 2.5 percent to Rs 1,342.5 crore quarter-on-quarter.On the profitability side, the company said its operating margin will stay in the current 14 percent mark in the near term. This is because the company is investing in technology and to hire teams across the board.Additionally, Guha said utilisation levels at 87 percent in the October-December quarter is at the optimal level. This implies utilisation rates will not go over and above the present levels.Utilisation refers to the percentage of billable hours that employees are actively working on client projects.Reducing smaller clientsGuha said the company has been actively reducing its number of active customers who are not generating significant revenues. “When you take that resource or capability out and invest in the larger accounts, you will more than make up right for the revenue loss in the small accounts,” he said.The company will continue to invest in its top 100 accounts, Guha added.As of quarter ended December, the IT services exporter reduced its active clients by 6 sequentially to 272. Year-on-year, active number of clients decreased by 27.Guha said ambiguity exists as to how the company’s top clients will perform in the coming quarters, adding that it is “wait and watch” scenario for the company.Generative AIGuha said Birlasoft aims to use Gen AI first in the company itself to gauge the effectiveness of its models in driving productivity. The company has about 30 Gen AI use-cases deployed internally, Guha said.Although external customer engagement is underway with 30-40 active use cases, Guha acknowledged that Gen AI is yet to translate into tangible revenue for the company."

India must roll back tariff increases, reduce local manufacturing mandates, and ease price controls that hinder trade, while the US must re-authorise the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme and review tariffs on Indian steel and alumnium imports","US-India goods trade is falling at a time when American firms are purportedly looking to diversify supply chains. However, India is not alone. US goods trade with most of its largest trade partners has declined. India’s goods trade with the world is declining as well. But the drop of trade with India is particularly sharp.The high degree of concentration of US exports in a few categories – namely hydrocarbons, gold and gems has proven to be a significant determinant. Hitting the oft stated $500 billion trade target will be difficult if the countries continue to over-rely on a handful of sectors for the bulk of our trade. In 2024, leaders from both countries should push hard to diversify the bilateral trade basket.India has firmly planted itself as a top-10 goods trade partner to the United States with over $123b in two-way trade over the last twelve months. The United States is India’s top goods trade partner. Economic interdependence is growing due to the countries’ respective market sizes and economic growth patterns. Supply chain concerns stemming from Covid-19 disruptions and growing concerns about the China-centered security challenges have prompted a widening array of firms to look at supply chain alternatives.US-India Goods Trade: A Narrow Trade BasketDespite this, both nations have seen recent drops in goods trade. India’s goods trade with the world fell by about 4.7 percent in the past year to $1.1 trillion. America’s goods trade is also declining marginally, with total trade falling in the past year with eight of its 10 largest goods trade partners. However, goods trade with India fell particularly sharply – down 8 percent year-on-year – only behind China (-17 percent) and Vietnam (-12 percent). American exports to India were hit particularly hard, dropping 15 percent year-on-year.Digging into the sectoral data from both the United States and Indian governments, a pattern is apparent. US exports to India are over-reliant on a few sectors.Petroleum, coal, diamonds, natural gas, and gold collectively make up 40 percent of total US exports. Of these five sectors, Indian imports are down across-the-board in all except gold. While the Indian Rupee has declined during this period, the two percent decline is not nearly enough to account for the dollar decline in trade.Both governments are prioritising increases in “strategic trade,” the narrow-yet-crucial sectors that will power our future economies. This includes areas like new and renewable energy, semiconductors, defense manufacturing, and more. Achieving policy changes and commercial success in these areas will help. But finding ways to improve bilateral trade in more mundane areas like consumer goods, chemicals, and agriculture products has proven much more difficult.For policymakers, the indication is clear. Leaders in Washington and New Delhi need to work hard in 2024 to diversify goods trade.Liberalising Trade Amid ElectionsElections present both challenges and opportunities in this regard. India is expected to have a national election in April-May. A newly elected government with a fresh mandate can hopefully push to reverse some anti-trade decisions of recent years by rolling back tariff increases, reducing local manufacturing mandates, and easing price controls and other domestic restrictions that act as unofficial trade barriers. India should also do a deeper assessment of the types of tariff reductions on input goods that can have a stimulative effect on India’s ability to attract manufacturing investments.The United States should also have a clear agenda. Congress should move to re-authorise the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme, and the Biden administration should leverage this to remove restrictions on India. The 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from India and other nations had adverse effects.Taking steps to liberalise trade during an election year can be tricky. However, with rolling election schedules in both nations, allowing leaders to hide behind the excuse of elections will endemically stymie trade policy progress.The fact that petroleum, coal, and natural gas all rank among America’s top exports also presents a difficult juxtaposition for an administration that is pursuing decarbonisation globally. If the Biden administration’s programs are successful, the over-reliance of US exports to India in these sectors will face acute threats in the future.The reasons for deeper US-India economic integration are obvious. Both nations have large and growing economies, large populations, and increasing concerns about the security of over-reliance on China as the globe’s manufacturing hub. Growing and diversifying trade is mutually reinforcing and can prepare us for potential shocks from over-reliance on key sectors.Richard M.

388,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/turkey-is-becoming-investible-again-12196871.html,Turkey is becoming investible again,"February 05, 2024 05:08 PM IST","After years of political interference in its monetary policy, a collapse in the Turkish lira's value over the past five years and a soaring inflation rate, there are promising signs that orthodox financial policies are back in place","Whisper it quietly, but Turkey is on the verge of becoming investible again for foreign investors. After years of political interference in its monetary policy, a collapse in the Turkish lira's value over the past five years and a soaring inflation rate, there are promising signs that orthodox financial policies are back in place. The central bank is confident enough to welcome foreigners back into lira bonds, and has signalled an end to the monetary tightening cycle that has seen eight consecutive increases in the official interest rate.Since President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's narrow re-election last May, there’s been a change in economic governance away from his unconventional view that higher interest rates cause higher inflation.Fundamental to this new approach was the appointment in June of Finance and Economy Minister Mehmet Simsek for a second tour of duty. A former Wall Street banker, Erdogan fired him in 2018 after nine years in the role, and his return is a big positive for market stability.Friday’s resignation of central bank Governor Hafize Gaye Erkan, appointed the same month as Simsek with a glittering resume, may have undermined that stability were it not for the caliber of her replacement, Deputy Governor Fatih Karahan. He’s been a member of the central bank’s rate-setting panel since July, and previously worked at the New York Federal Reserve and as a principal economist at Amazon.com Inc., as well as holding teaching positions at Columbia University and New York University. In a statement, the Turkish finance ministry said Erdogan “has full confidence and support in our economy team and our program.”“While sudden leadership changes bring discomfort for investors, we see the new CBRT Governor as positive for disinflation and lira,” JPMorgan Chase & Co analyst Fatih Akcelik wrote in a note to clients. “We expect high rates for longer along with tighter macroprudential measures.”Simsek emphasised on Wednesday to the Istanbul Chamber of Industrialists that monetary policy is aimed at anchoring future inflation and that the lira is “quite competitive.” The new approach is starting to work; foreign holdings of Turkish government bonds doubled in Decemberfrom an all-time low of just $1 billion. Turkish equity holdings by overseas investors have also plummeted, to less than of 10 percent of the market.The Turkish central bank has hiked the benchmark one-week repurchase rate interest rates to a staggering 45 percent from 8.5 percent in June. This makes the cost of hedging lira exposure eye-wateringly high; taking advantage of such high interest rates is offset by the prospect of substantial currency losses. The relative scale of that trade may now be turning in foreign investors' favour, according to Bloomberg Economics Turkey economist Selva Bahar Baziki. When the Federal Reserve starts cutting US interest rates, prompting a weaker dollar, it will provide fertile ground for emerging markets that could lead to outsized gains in both the currency and domestic securities markets.Banks including Deutsche Bank AG, BNP Paribas SA and JPMorgan also predict a turnaround for the lira bond market this year. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predict that interest rates could fall by 20 percentage points by the end of the year, a view that’s reflected in a heavily inverted yield curve with 10-year yields below 25 percent.The central bank's focus is shifting to reducing lira liquidity and supporting the currency, given that the economy still faces major problems. Turkey’s current account swung back into deficit at the end of 2023, a long-standing problem that has been marginally improved by the return of tourism. The government’s budget deficit has ballooned following the costs of two horrendous earthquakes. The central bank's foreign-exchange reserves may have increased by $100 billion in recent months, but it’s almost certainly from a negative base. Turkey adopted a smoke-and-mirrors strategy via state-controlled commercial banks in forward-currency swaps to disguise the true nature of its reserves.Turkey has the most deeply negative real interest rates in emerging markets, after adjusting for a 65 percent inflation rate. Core price measures are increasing by more than 70 percent, and headline inflation will rise above that before it turns lower. Gross domestic product climbed at a near 6 percent pace in the third quarter, up from 4 percent earlier in the year, but this is still too tepid to dig the nation out of its deficit hole. JPMorgan analysts expect the lira to weaken to 36 versus the dollar by year end from about 30.5 currently, though forward currency rates suggest it could be closer to 40.The regional elections on March 31 keep the political risks alive, and additional fiscal stimulus in the run up to the polls could exacerbate the dire inflation outlook. But the geopolitical atmosphere is improving afterErdogan acquiesced to Sweden joining the NATO military alliance. Subsequently, the US greenlit the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey.Turkey is a top 20 global economy with annual GDP in excess of $1 trillion.

The ARPU was driven by ""consistent strategy of acquiring high value customers and improved realisations.""The stock ended the day at Rs 1,113.60 on the National Stock Exchange, up 3.23 percent.“Revenue from India business sustained its momentum and grew sequentially by 3 percent, while the consolidated revenue was impacted by the devaluation of the Nigerian Naira and Malawian Kwacha,"" said Gopal Vittal, MD, Bharti Airtel.""The quarter witnessed a strong growth trajectory for the postpaid and Homes business, while our DTH business added 388k net adds – the highest in the last 12 quarters. We remain on course with our strategy of premiumisation that helped us add 7.4 million 4G/5G customers and exit the quarter with an industry leading ARPU of Rs 208.Vittal called for tariff revision as well, which has not happened for a while.""Even at this ARPU, our return on capital employed, however, continues to be low at 9.4 percent. To ensure industry health, tariff repair is extremely critical,” he said."
390,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/moneycontrol-pro-panorama-a-new-800-pound-gorilla-eyes-the-street-12193911.html,Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | A new 800-pound gorilla eyes the Street,"February 05, 2024 05:54 PM IST","In this edition of Moneycontrol Pro Panorama: Budget highlights government’s spending priorities, China ready to take over as biggest auto exporter, Actor Vijay's political debut causes a stir, and more","Dear Reader,The Panorama newsletter is sent to Moneycontrol Pro subscribers on market days. It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. We had the Street wishing some years ago that Patanjali Ayurved would get listed. Baba Ramdev granted that wish partially by acquiring Ruchi Soya and then moving its foods businesses to the company, which now goes by the name of Patanjali Foods. Thankfully, Patanjali Ayurved is not yet listed, otherwise its shareholders would have been wondering at the logic of the company reportedly making a bid to acquire Rolta India under the corporate insolvency process.In the heydays of internet businesses, some sighing at eye-popping private market valuations could also be heard on the Street. Whether it was that or the onset of a funding winter, many of these start-ups did take to public markets to fulfil those wishes too, although several of those IPOs made at heady valuations eventually left a trail of broken hearts and bank balances.Then, there was the listing of LIC that had everyone salivating at the prospect of the public sector behemoth being finally held by the Indian public as minority shareholders. After all, it is one of the largest investors in the Indian market and while its life insurance business is no doubt the main offering, its sizeable investment portfolio that spans a vast spectrum of companies was also an attraction. The IPO succeeded, but the stock has disappointed and only recently crossed its IPO price.In all this, nobody, nobody, held out a hope that Hyundai Motor would get listed. Not that they would not desire it. It was just assumed that similar to the low-profile South Korean conglomerates, such as Samsung and LG’s units, Hyundai’s unit too would remain privately held. These companies command a significant share of their respective industries, but prefer to be privately held. It should come as a big surprise to investors then that Hyundai is considering a listing of Hyundai Motor, with a $3 billion (Rs 24,900 crore) IPO that will value it at Rs 2.5 lakh crore. That will trump LIC’s issue size of Rs 21,000 crore although not by a very wide margin.But this is not about which IPO is the biggest alone. For years, Maruti Suzuki has ruled the listed automobile roost, particularly when it comes to passenger cars. Investors will finally get one more company to do a peer comparison with, to decide which car stock they want to invest in. FMCG investors, for example, have HUL and ITC to choose from, as a large-cap FMCG stock to own. More choice is not only good for investors, but can also push company managements to run their business more efficiently from shareholders’ point of view.These are reports at this point and the company has not confirmed the plan. However, if the IPO does happen and if even part of the issue involves a fresh issue of shares, then that may see Hyundai Motor roll out aggressive investments to grow its share of the Indian market. What’s more, if Hyundai’s experience is a good one, the other South Korean conglomerates too could go in for a listing. A local listing could be mutually beneficial as they seek to cement their foothold in a fast-growing large economy. It also widens and deepens the listed market, as one of the factors fund managers bemoan is a lack of adequate stocks to own that then leads to artificially higher valuations. On this front, there are 66 IPOs on the runway seeking to raise Rs 72,000 crore in FY25. Will Hyundai add to this list is the big question. Will there be enough demand for these stocks? Will their valuations be reasonable or seek to capitalise on the hype and leave investors nursing losses when the music slows down? These are all questions investors should ask even as they keep some powder dry for IPOs.Meanwhile, the economy is in fine shape as seen from the PMI data, and as Manas Chakravarty writes in ‘Saare Jahaan Se Achcha, PMI Hamara’. “The reading is further proof that the corporate sector story in India is getting better and better, providing an underpinning to the buoyant sentiments in the equity markets.”The highlight of today’s edition is the MC Pro Election 2024 Portfolio put together by our independent and in-house research team. The core of their investment thesis is this: “Against this backdrop, our focus has been on companies which are building the future and have the best prospects of benefiting from the post-election government pushing the pedal on reforms.”They have identified 14 stocks that they believe can capitalise on the economy’s growth trajectory, once the new government takes over and the economy heads for a reset.

We are in discussion and these are yet to be completed,"" Sharma said, adding that the company was in talks with the RBI to solve issues concerning the bank's customers.At 2 pm, the stock was locked in a 10 percent lower circuit at Rs 438.50 on the National Stock Exchange. The stock has tanked 42 percent in the last three sessions following the RBI action."

Aster will also add capacity to existing hospitals in Medcity, MIMS Kannur by about 100 beds each and Aster Whitefield with 159 beds.Eyeing new marketsThe company is also exploring opportunities in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh, with plans to enter markets where it can secure a position among the top 3. He added that the company is scouting for opportunities similar to its current model.“To create a model like what we have done in the metros, you need a population of 3 million. Maharashtra has some cities which have a population of 3 million. So that's a good place to put up a hospital of our size and our structure,” Shetty said. He sees opportunities in cities like Pune and Nagpur for expansion plans.Founded in 1987 from a single clinic in Dubai, Aster operates in India and the Gulf region.It currently has a presence in Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, AP and Telangana. It has 19 hospitals, 13 clinics, 226 pharmacies, 251 patient experiences with a total of 4,000+ operational beds in India currently.“Our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is very low. We will be able to leverage further and the rest from internal cash accruals,” Shetty said. The India region business had a net debt of Rs 617 crore for the quarter ended September 30 2023. During H1 FY24, the net debt (including lease liabilities)/ EBITDA ratio stood at 3.2.International operationsAster had approved the sale of its business in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) region to Alpha GCC Holdings Ltd for a consideration of $1.01 billion. The board will consider the distribution of 70–80 percent of the upfront consideration of $903 million from this transaction as a dividend to its shareholders, which will be in the range of Rs 110 to Rs 120 per share.In the labs and pharmacies business the company will focus on turning profitable rather than expanding for now. “Lab is going to break even in the final quarter and we expect by next year-end pharmacy also should break even,” Dr Shetty said.He said that international patients were around 5 percent of the revenues at the group level. He said that in the separation they have drawn up clauses for continuing the flow of international patients from GCC countries. “Post segregation the channel will be kept open and further it is not going to have a major implication in terms of size and numbers,” he added.The company’s promoter family currently holds a 41.88 percent stake in the Indian listed company and 35 percent in the GCC entity.

But there is a twist in the tale,"February 05, 2024 11:05 AM IST","Several brokerages, including Motilal Oswal, Jefferies and Nomura, have a “buy” call on SBI stock. JP Morgan and Bernstein have an “overweight” call on the counter.","State Bank of India (SBI) has failed to live up to the projections made by the Street with its Q3 net profit being battered down by a hefty wage and pension bill. The state-run lender's overall earnings, however, remained healthy, driven by lower credit costs, despite weak core operating performance, which attracted bullish calls from brokerages. Analysts believe that SBI is well-placed amid tight liquidity.For the quarter ended December 2023, the bank's net profit fell 35 percent on-year to Rs 9,163 crore under Rs 7,100-crore pension liabilities. The net interest income (NII) of the country's largest bank came in at Rs 39,815 crore, missing estimates of Rs 40,304 crore.According to analysts at Noumra, despite soft NIM and significant one-off expenses in Q3FY24, SBI demonstrated robust loan growth, although NIM fell short of expectations.""The bank is positioned well within the current tight liquidity environment,"" it said, adding that SBI's operational expenses were managed effectively, excluding the impact of elevated provisions for wage revisions.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionWhile the brokerage has put a 'buy' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 755 per share, it has adjusted its FY24 EPS estimate downward by 13 percent.SBI's asset quality remained robust in the quarter under review, with net slippage at just 0.4 percent.JP Morgan noted that despite a 12-bps sequential decrease in core NIMs due to deposit repricing, SBI's credit costs were lower, with core loan losses offset against account level upgrades.Looking ahead, the brokerage believes that Q4 is expected to see another wage revision hike, while FY25 stands to benefit from a moderation in wage costs, driving up the operating leverage. It has an 'overweight' call on the stock with a target price of Rs 725 per share.Jefferies also has a 'buy' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 810 per share. The public sector lender's NIMs were effectively managed, contributing to NII growth, while loan growth improved to 14 percent, primarily driven by corporate loans, the brokerage noted. The unsecured retail segment shows signs of normalisation downward, it said.""Despite concerns, asset quality is performing better than estimated. With a CET-1 ratio of 10.4 percent, there's a limited buffer, but high return on equity (RoE) and marked-to-margin (MTM) gains may provide support. However, the potential for a near-term capital raise remains an overhang,"" Jefferies said in a report.Note that the CET-1 ratio compares a bank's capital against its risk-weighted assets to determine its ability to withstand financial distress. International firm Bernstein also has an 'Outperform' rating on SBI with a target price of Rs 710 per share.Also Read | SBI Q3 results: Net profit plummets 35% to Rs 9,163 crore, asset quality healthyAccording to Motilal Oswal, SBI has various levers such as cash deposit (CD) ratio and marginal cost of the fund-based lending rate (MCLR) repricing to keep margins stable.SBI's business growth remains robust, with signs of a recovery in the corporate segment, the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock with an unchanged target price of Rs 800.Analysts at JM Financial Services believe delivery of growth on guided lines, sustenance of NIMs near current levels and controlled asset quality parameters aiding controlled credit costs should lead to strong profitability going ahead.""We value the core banking business at 1.2x FY26 P/BV and arrive at our SoTP-based target price of Rs 800 per share,"" the brokerage said as it maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock.At 9:43am, the SBI shares traded flat at Rs 651.70 a piece on the NSE.

502,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moneycontrol-pro-market-outlook-market-achieves-record-highs-caution-advised-12190781.html,"Moneycontrol Pro Market Outlook | Market achieves record highs, caution advised","February 05, 2024 09:43 AM IST","The benchmark indices achieved a new record high, a correction towards the close led to a 2.34 percent gain for the week, marking the most substantial weekly increase in two months","Dear Reader,Indian markets were focused on the interim budget during the week, moving in a narrow range. Volatility was high during the week due to the FOMC meeting and the interim budget.Despite the budget's minimal impact and the Federal Reserve's maintenance of the status quo, global cues spurred a market surge on Friday.While benchmark indices achieved a new record high, a correction towards the close led to a 2.34 percent gain for the week, marking the most substantial weekly increase in two months. This positive closure came after two consecutive weeks of negative performance.Structural Weakness ContinuesHowever, structural weaknesses persist in the market. The Nifty formed an engulfing bear candlestick pattern the preceding week, signalling weakness on weekly charts. Although there was a recovery in the Nifty this week, it failed to close above the previous two weeks' highs, maintaining the pattern's significance.The weekly chart indicates an inverted hammer at the end of the week, revealing that despite an intraday recovery, the market faced selling pressure at higher levels. Confirmation of this weakness would be indicated by a close below 21805 on daily charts and below 21137 on weekly charts in the upcoming week.Caution is advised, as various sentiment indicators are reversing from record levels. It is not a time for complacency, especially considering the possibility of a correction back to the 20-week average, approximately 20500.Analyzing the chart below, it is evident that Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) are unwinding their long positions. While this was initially a reason for caution, the situation has escalated as they now hold short positions. Despite the potential for short covering to drive short-term market gains, the overarching stance of FIIs remains directional. Their current position is not at the extreme levels historically associated with market bottoms. The possibility of further additions to short positions suggests anticipating another downturn or adopting a hedged position. In either scenario, caution is warranted. Notably, FIIs continue to sell in the cash market, with sales amounting to Rs 35,977.87 crore in January 2024 and Rs 2,008.68 crore in the previous week. Source: web.strike.moneyThis week, we shall look at the sector that has been the reason behind the strong market move. The Nifty PSE index is the best-performing sector index. The one-sided move was on record volumes and very high relative strength readings. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) level was 91, and the weekly RSI was 93.These are dangerous levels and carry the risk of falling on their own weight. When something overextends itself to this degree, the reversal can happen quickly. Correction in the sector is far overdue and can impact the benchmark index negatively when it happens, given their weights in the index. Source: web.strike.moneyAnother cause for concern is the volume pattern in Nifty 500 stocks, as seen in the chart below. The volume pattern shows extreme bullish sentiment as volumes and prices are directly proportional. Rising prices produce rising volume activity, and the peak is generally made with the highest volumes.Recently, the Nifty 500 has shown not only peak volume but a prolonged period of such volumes. This could be a sign of distribution as the broad market gets euphoric and money shifts from one set of stocks to the other. Such volume activity has in the past occurred near turning points in the market. Source: web.strike.moneyIndices and Market BreadthLast week's performance can be summed up by the strong performance on Friday, which helped Nifty touch a new high but witnessed profit booking towards the end.Nifty touched a fresh record high of 22,126.80 while BSE Sensex inched closer to its all-time high of 73,427.59 but closed the week at 72,085.63.Multiple sectors saw strength during the week, with the Nifty PSU Bank index gaining 11.5 percent, the Nifty Oil & Gas index rising 9 percent, the Nifty Energy index rising 8 percent, and the Nifty Metal, Auto, and Realty indices each increasing 4 percent.During the week, the BSE Small-cap index gained 3.3 percent and touched a new high of 46,169.7. NBCC, with a 47.46 percent gain, Shakti Pumps, with a 41.63 percent gain, and Punjab & Sind Bank, with a 40.03 percent jump, were among the top gainers.Global Market As in the case of India, US stocks also ended sharply higher on Friday, and the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high. S&P 500 gained 1.38 percent, Nasdaq was up 1.12 percent while Dow Jones closed 1.43 percent up. All three US stock indexes recorded their fourth consecutive weekly gains.The MSCI World index reflected the optimism in the US and Indian markets and closed the week nearly one percent higher.Chinese markets closed 6.19 percent lower, while the Hang Seng was down 2.62 percent after a court in Hong Kong ordered the liquidation of China's biggest real estate player, Evengrande.Stocks to watchAmong the frontline stocks showing strong upside momentum are IDBI, LIC Housing Finance, Chennai Petro, Bajaj Auto, Subex, L&T Finance, Gujarat Gas.Tata Communications, Tata Chemicals, SBI Cards, Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints, and AU Bank are stocks showing weakness.Cheers, Shishir Asthana"

If we delay resuming production, people might start doubting our business. If rumours spread, it affects the decisions of our suppliers.""Prolonged factory deflation is threatening the survival of smaller Chinese exporters who are locked in relentless price wars for shrinking business as higher interest rates abroad and rising trade protectionism squeeze demand.Producer prices have been falling for 15 straight months, crushing profit margins to the point where industrial output and jobs are now at risk and compounding China's economic woes, which include a property crisis and debt crunch.About 180 million people work in export-related jobs, commerce ministry data from 2022 shows.Raymond Yeung, chief China economist at ANZ, says fixing deflation should be a higher policy priority than reaching the expected growth target of around 5% for this year.Report this ad""Companies cut product prices, then staff salaries. Then consumers won't buy - this could be a vicious cycle,"" he said.Profits at China's industrial firms fell 2.3% last year, adding to the 4% drop in COVID-hit 2022. An official survey showed manufacturing activity contracting for a fourth straight month in January, while export orders shrank for a 10th month.For Lin, that has meant the $1.5 million order his client placed was 25% below a similar one last year. It was 10% below production cost.Sluggish exports mean policymakers need to pull other levers to reach their growth target, increasing the urgency of stimulating household consumption, analysts say.""The more 'rebalanced' growth is, the faster that downward pressure on prices and margins will dissipate,"" said Louis Kuijs, Asia-Pacific chief economist at S&P Global.'RAT RACE'China has been funnelling financial resources into the manufacturing sector, rather than consumers, exacerbating overcapacity and deflation concerns, even in booming higher-end sectors, such as electric vehicles.An executive at an automotive moulds factory from the eastern Zhejiang province, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, expects the firm's output and exports to rise, but earnings to fall, describing the intensifying competition in the industry as a ""rat race.""As China's central bank unleashes liquidity into the financial system to spur growth, banks are chasing factories with cheap loan offers.But squeezed out by bigger rivals, smaller firms are unwilling to take on loans to finance new business, in what economists see as a broken link in China's increasingly inefficient monetary policy.Investment by private companies, which according to state officials provide 80% of urban jobs, dropped 0.4% last year, while state investment rose 6.4%.""Many bank managers call me and they sound very anxious when they can't lend money,"" said Miao Yujie, an e-commerce clothing exporter.Even after halving his workforce to about 20 people last year, he cannot turn a profit as bigger firms elbow him out of the market.""But you only need to borrow when you want to expand,"" said Miao, adding he mulls closing his business.THIS TIME IS DIFFERENTChina also went through a deflationary scare in 2015, when it faced overcapacity in primary industries, such as steel, dominated by state-owned enterprises. Authorities downsized these companies to reduce supply and accelerated infrastructure and property construction to boost demand.""This time it's more of a private sector surplus,"" said Hwabao Trust economist Nie Wen, singling out electronics, chemicals and machinery makers. These firms employ large numbers of people, a sensitive spot for China's policymakers.""It is therefore difficult to shrink supply, so more effort should be made on the demand side this year,"" Nie said.Factory owners say the pressure to cut jobs is intense, even if some are reluctant to do so.Yang Bingben, whose company makes industrial-use valves in the eastern city of Wenzhou, said he had thought of shutting down the business, but keeps it running as he feels indebted to his workers, most of whom are close to retirement age.Still, he doesn't know how long the factory can survive.""This year will be the best of the next decade,"" Yang said."

It was commendable given this is an election year. The biggest win for the debt market – Fiscal deficit target of 5.1 percent of GDP for FY24-25 which was much lower than the expectation on the street. The government has also reduced the fiscal deficit for FY24 from 5.9 percent to 5.8 percent of GDP.The Budget delicately maintained balanced among pre-election political messaging, growth (led by capex), consumer confidence and fiscal consolidation. Buoyant tax revenues (both direct and indirect taxes), higher RBI dividend and reducing subsidy leakage has supported government in its fiscal position. As per budget, in coming year, the further consolidation is expected to come from spending side and improvement in the quality of expenditure with continued focus on capex.Nominal GDP growth for FY25 is assumed to be 10.5 percent for estimating the FY25 fiscal ratios, which according to us is fair. If growth momentum continues, it can be revised upwards in the full budget.Also read: Market action: 5 IPOs opening for subscription, 6 listings scheduled in coming weekDirect tax revenues have been buoyant in FY24 which has helped in funding higher outlay on subsidies for FY24 and keeping fiscal deficit lower than budgeted. The direct tax collections have more than trebled over the last 10 years. The tax collection is estimated to grow at ~12 percent in FY25, indicating a tax buoyancy of 1.1. At the same time, gross tax revenues (both direct and indirect tax collection) are estimated to increase by ~11 percent in FY25. The government has set a disinvestment target of Rs 50,000 crore for FY25. The non-tax revenue has been increased from revised estimate of Rs 3.75 lakh crore in FY24 to Rs 3.99 lakh crore in FY25. The revenue growth assumption in our assessment appears to be fair.The government has aimed for lower revenue expenditure which is expected to grow by 3.23 percent in FY25 keeping fiscal consolidation in mind. Hence the overall expenditure has been increased from revised estimate of Rs 44.90 lakh crore in FY24 to Rs 47.66 lakh crore in FY25. Importantly, the government has maintained its focus on long-term growth by allocating a record high of Rs 11.11 lakh crore towards capital expenditure (versus revised estimate of Rs 9.5 lakh crore in FY24). It indicates government commitment to achieve $7 trillion GDP by 2030.Also read: India can sustain current levels of growth with or without private capex: Finance SecretaryGiven this, private capex is also likely to pick up in FY25. Hence the normalization of revenue expenditure has been offset by increase in budgeted capex. This can be seen as disinflationary budget.The fiscal deficit target for FY25 is pegged at Rs 16.85 lakh crore. The government has estimated Rs 4.6 lakh crore of funding from other sources, with bulk coming in from Small Savings. This leaves Rs 12.25 lakh crore number for market borrowings, out of which Rs 50,000 crore is likely to be borrowed from treasury bills and ~Rs 11.75 lakh crore from dated securities. Adjusting for maturities and switches, the gross supply for FY25 is expected to be Rs 14.13 lakh crore.The RBI's policy meeting is due next week on February 8. Though RBI has reiterated that the policy would continue to remain disinflationary, the RBI's hawkish monetary policy stance may soften in FY25 due to a change in fiscal policy and lower inflation. We believe the RBI is likely to adopt a neutral stance by H1FY25 and possibility of 50 basis point repo rate cut, bringing the repo rate down to 6 percent in later part of FY25. Alongside gradual policy easing, we foresee a further decline in yields and INR stability.The budget is positive for the financial markets. Higher capex brings in good news for growth and lower than expected gross borrowing numbers would help in bringing down the cost of borrowing for the economy. India faces an interesting year ahead with general elections and J P Morgan Emerging Market Bond index inclusion amidst potential easing of yields globally. Index inclusion will be a significant source of incremental bond demand, attracting ~$25 billion in FY25. This, along with the expected easing cycle, bode well for the Indian fixed income market in FY25 and beyond.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The cost of living will become lighter. The economy will become stronger,'' Wickremesinghe stressed.Sri Lanka in April 2022 declared its first ever sovereign default since gaining independence from Britain in 1948.The crisis led Wickremesinghe's predecessor Gotabaya Rajapaksa out of office through a campaign of public agitation. Wickremesinghe stepped in to fill in Rajapaksa's remaining term.Since then, Wickremesinghe has put in place unpopular economic reforms to supplement a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Wickremesinghe has steered the country out of a period of shortages of essentials and long hours of power cuts.The government continues to struggle to restructure its external debt while public dissatisfaction with raised utility rates and taxes has made Wickremesinghe unpopular.Nevertheless, he expects to contest the next presidential election due in the last quarter of the year. The Opposition has vowed to oust him, blaming him for crushing democratic dissent and placing a heavy economic burden on the people."

511,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/moneycontrol-pro-weekender-bulls-roar-in-whirlwind-week-12183691.html,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | Bulls roar in whirlwind week,"February 03, 2024 12:52 PM IST",Market salutes conservative Budget stance,"Dear Reader,What with the Fed meet, the interim Budget, the global manufacturing PMI data, a spate of corporate results, RBI’s Paytm bombshell, and the IMF’s update of its World Economic Outlook Report, this week has been full of feverish excitement. The Indian markets came out of it with flying colours and both stock and bond markets had an excellent week.At Jerome Powell’s press conference after the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, he set the cat among the pigeons. When the Fox Business correspondent asked him: “Is it in your view a little premature to think that rate cuts are right around the corner?” Powell said, ""I don't think it's likely that the Committee will reach a level of confidence by the time of the March meeting to identify March as the time to do that.” Since the markets were betting on a rate cut at the FOMC meeting in March, it’s no wonder they sold off.But Powell had also underlined that they were confident that inflation was slowing, and it was just a matter of time before they cut rates. All that the markets did was to price in a delay in the rate cut to the May meeting. In fact, the Fed Funds market is now factoring in a 62 percent probability that the Fed Funds rate will be 375-400 percent or lower by December 2024, compared to a 47 percent probability a week ago. The Fed Funds rate at present is 5.25-5.50 percent. In other words, as my colleague Anubhav Sahu wrote, the base case is for rate cuts, but the question is when. A day after Powell’s press conference, the US markets rebounded smartly.The IMF’s update to its World Economic Outlook added to the optimism with its heading, ‘Moderating Inflation and Steady Growth Open Path to Soft Landing’. The IMF revised up its 2024 forecast for global growth a bit and revised down its inflation projection for the advanced economies. Among the countries for which growth forecasts for 2024 have been raised are the US, China, India and, wonder of wonders, Russia. The IMF said, “The faster-than-expected fall in inflation is allowing an increasing number of central banks to move from raising policy rates to adjusting to a less restrictive stance.’’ It also said, “In many cases, amid rising debt and limited budgetary room to manoeuvre, and with inflation declining and economies better able to absorb effects of fiscal tightening, a renewed focus on fiscal consolidation is needed.’’ The Indian government responded very positively to that.The India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index for January came in at a four-month high of 56.5, signifying strong expansion from the previous month. Contrast China’s 50.8 reading and the ASEAN economies’ 50.3 reading for their respective manufacturing PMIs.What’s more, animal spirits are also high in Indian manufacturing, and the survey showed that confidence in the future was at its most upbeat in 13 months. India’s exceptional performance is reflected in its stock markets.The Global Manufacturing PMI data showed that global manufacturing output rose for the first time in eight months in January. Data broken down by nation showed that output rose in China, India and Brazil (among others), and fell more slowly in the US, Japan and the Euro area. Bennett Parrish, global economist at JPMorgan, said, “The PMI subcomponents tracking new orders, future activity and employment also made advances, further raising optimism that fuller recovery could be established during the coming months. The impact of disruptions to the Red Sea shipping routes on delivery delays and prices seems minimal thus far, at least at the global level.”The confidence in the performance of the Indian economy was reflected in the Interim Budget. The Budget belied fears of populist giveaways before the national elections and instead, by slashing the fiscal deficit, sent a message that this is a responsible, conservative government, a votary of sound money. My colleague Madhuchanda Dey pointed out that the assumptions made in the fiscal maths are entirely credible. Some of our Budget analysis on the macroeconomy and the bond and stock markets are given below, in case you missed them.As for the Indian markets, they seem to have had a late realisation that the Budget was actually good for them. As we wrote here, they will now shift focus to other triggers. Attention now shifts to the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee’s next meeting from February 6-8 and we wondered whether the government’s fiscal prudence will signal a dovish pivot from the RBI.Finally, after that rather exhausting week, if you feel like reading a light-hearted, quirky and unconventional take on the Budget, here are twenty wacky responses to it.Cheers,Manas ChakravartyHere are some of the other stories and insights we published this week, apart from our technical picks in the equity, commodity and forex markets:StocksPaytm, Mas Financial, Tata Steel, Sky Gold, JSW Steel, Shriram Finance, Cyient, Dalmia Bharat, Syngene, ITC, GAIL, Concor, Bajaj Finance, AU Small Finance Bank, Marico, Craftsman Automation, L&T, Mahindra Finance, Petronet LNG, Cholamandalam Investment, Which life insurance company should command sector-leading valuations?, Titan, Maruti, Dabur IndiaMarketsThe best tool to spot a bull market, for freeInterim budget brings cheer to bond marketsSignalling continuity of reforms in Budget should give investors comfort10-year sovereign bond to trade below 7 percent in near termCompanies and industryITC, Bajaj Finance, Oberoi Realty, Mahindra Finance, Auto sales, Lessons to learn from the Paytm debacleFinancial TimesThe cycle vs the trend: investors need to prepare for secular changeWhy political leaders are so unpopular nowGlobal trade: the looming tensions over China’s subsidiesLEX | The days of $100 oil prices are overInside EdgeSME I-bankers’ package deal, Surya story brightens, PSU rally confounds veterans, Sanghi Inds bullsWealth God, Honey make right (s) choice in Indiabulls Housing, unseasonal Rain, SME I-bankers in SEBI's crosshairs, MFs' tried and tested formulaBlock deal Ponzi scheme has HNIs excited and brokers alarmed, IRFC’s cock-and-bull story, bears eye NBFCsEconomy and PolicyIndia-UK FTA, Pro Economic Tracker, A Made in India policy needed to create Global SMEs, Political strategy must steer rooftop solar power to the masses, Budget lays out a long-term road mapPoliticsAaya Nitish, Gaya NitishGlobal politics and economicsWhy the Evergrande crisis is not a big dealThe Eastern Window: Will the Chinese government's desperate efforts to prop up its free-falling stock markets succeed?Tech & StartupsWipro, Infosys, Cognizant CEOs shrug off poaching concernsPersonal FinanceThree sector funds in spotlight after interim Budget 2024How to scratch that speculative itch, without losing your shirtICICI Prudential MF launches a new value-strategy scheme.

512,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/budget/cea-nageswaran-says-fy25-budgets-fiscal-deficit-target-not-about-making-a-statement-12184801.html,CEA Nageswaran says FY25 Budget's fiscal deficit target not about making a statement,"February 03, 2024 11:08 AM IST","Nageswaran also rejected the K-shaped recovery theory that is being used to describe India's post-pandemic rebound. According to him, it is akin to the phrase 'Hindu rate of growth' that was ""unthinkingly"" used and stuck for no reason.","The government's decision to target a fiscal deficit of 5.1 percent of GDP in 2024-25 may have left markets stunned, but there was no intent to ""make a statement"" of any sort with such aggressive consolidation, Chief Economic Adviser V Anantha Nageswaran has said, adding that the interim Budget had not made any unrealistic assumptions to arrive at the lower-than-expected target.""It's not that we are trying to make a statement here. We are comfortable with the numbers,"" Nageswaran told Moneycontrol in an interview after the interim Budget.Economists polled by Moneycontrol had expected the fiscal deficit target for the next financial year to be set at 5.3 percent. However, the Indian government already has one eye on meeting its stated objective of cutting the deficit down to 4.5 percent or lower by 2025-26. Nageawaran said that commitment had to be reinforced.""We were at 5.9 percent when the Budget exercise started last year. So we need to demonstrate commitment to that path. We have to demonstrate credibility,"" he said, emphatically denying that the inclusion of Indian government bonds on global indices later this year had any role to play in setting the deficit target for 2024-25.As for what ratings agencies think, Nageswaran said while the government would welcome an upgrade, it was not ""chasing"" one.“At the end of the day, it is their prerogative. We can only do what we have to do and we are demonstrating that we are doing that. But they shouldn't be shifting the goalposts,"" the government's top economist said, echoing Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's post-Budget comments.When asked if the announcement of any major policies in the full Budget post the Lok Sabha elections could leave the fiscal deficit target untenable, Nageswaran refused to comment, saying it is ""too premature to speculate on that"".Four years of 7% growth?Being an interim Budget, Nageswaran and his team did not present an Economic Survey on January 31. Instead, on January 29, they published a report reviewing the Indian economy where they said the GDP may grow close to 7 percent in 2024-25. Nageswaran has stuck to that approximation.""I think 6.5-7 percent would be a good way to peg it...maybe tending towards the upper end of this range, at this point. But I think at least one quarter or four months of data has to pass before we can talk about the balance of risks,"" he said.For Nageswaran, giving precise growth forecasts is an exercise in futility as they always end up being wrong, except by chance.""We are here to talk about ranges of outcomes. That's why it is quite possible that we may end up achieving a fourth year of 7 percent or 7 percent-plus growth,"" he said.On January 5, the statistics ministry said the Indian economy may post a growth rate of 7.3 percent in 2023-24, up from 7.2 percent in 2022-23. In 2021-22, the GDP had increased by 9.1 percent.No K-shaped recoveryWhile India's recent growth numbers have surpassed all expectations, the general consensus among economists is that the post-pandemic recovery has been led by the upper class, with growth in demand for premium goods outstripping that for the mass-market segment. This pattern of recovery has been labelled 'K-shaped'.The government, however, has rejected this thesis, with Nageswaran adding to the criticism recently voiced by the finance minister.""This is like someone unthinkingly using the phrase 'Hindu rate of growth' that has stuck for no particular reason. It is the same Indian economy that has seen its decadal growth rates keep rising. So similarly, these kinds of alphabets are meaningless,"" the chief economic adviser said.However, Nageswaran did not deny growth has been uneven, with the coronavirus pandemic leading to reverse migration and temporarily resulting in an increase in the agricultural workforce.""We don't have data beyond 2021-22, but if you look at the RBI's KLEMS (capital, labour, energy, material, services) database, that shows that in 2021-22, manufacturing created a large number of jobs and the reverse migration began to reverse. But once you see the data for 2022-23 and 2023-24, you will see that it is beginning to happen. So obviously, until such time that you are confident of these trends, then the government would continue to make sure that it provides some sort of a buffer, or insurance to the public,"" Nageswaran said, referring to the decision to extend the free foodgrain scheme for an additional five years until 2028.Capex not slackingAs expected, the interim Budget raised the capital expenditure target for next year to a fresh record high of Rs 11.11 lakh crore, although the pace of increase cooled sharply to 11.1 percent compared to the 2023-24 budget estimate – something Nageswaran had indicated would happen way back in December 2022.""With every passing year, the base becomes higher. So you can't maintain the same growth rate on a higher base,"" he said.When asked if there were any concerns over private sector capex being concentrated in certain sectors such as construction, Nageswaran dismissed the suggestion as ""hair-splitting"".""Obviously, we would love to see much more all-round development. But certain places will start ahead of others. You are talking about a large, continental country – not everybody will be firing on all cylinders at all times."""

Modi also announced that the government is working on a new scheme to develop rest facilities on National Highways for truck and taxi drivers.""Drivers are an important part of the mobility sector. They drive for long hours but they do not have access to proper resting place…They do not get adequate time to take rest and sometimes this leads to road accidents,"" Modi said. In the first phase, 1,000 modern buildings with amenities such as food stalls, clean drinking water, toilets, parking and rest places will be constructed, he added.Modi said that it will give a boost to both the ease of living and ease of traveling for truck and taxi drivers, thereby improving their health and also help in preventing accidents. ""India is on the move, and is moving fast. In a way, this is the beginning of the golden period for India's mobility sector,"" he said.""Today India's economy is expanding rapidly. India is sure to become the third largest economy in the world in the third term of our government,"" the Prime Minister said. The country is going to general polls in April-May this year.The Prime Minister recalled a mobility-related conference from his first term (2014-19) and talked about his focus on battery and electric vehicles. Modi expressed satisfaction that he could see significant progress during his second term and said that in the third term mobility will see new heights. Stressing that the ""speed and scale"" of his government has changed the very definition of mobility in India, Modi said the numbers of growing economy and the growing income are bound to infuse new confidence in the mobility sector.Modi said that the number of cars sold in India rose from 12 crores to more than 21 crores from the 10 years before 2014 to after 2014, while the number of electric vehicles sold in India rose from two thousand per year 10 years ago to 12 lakh per year today. The Prime Minister said that India is making new policies keeping in mind the needs of the future.Referring to the Union Budget that was presented on Thursday, he said that in 2014 India's capital expenditure was less than 2 lakh crore which now has risen to more than 11 lakh crore. This has brought many opportunities for India's mobility sector as well, he added.The Prime Minister further said that the National Electric Mobility Mission is pushing the manufacturing of electric vehicles. Modi exhorted the industry to explore research avenues that utilize India's abundant raw materials for battery manufacturing and delve into areas such as green hydrogen and ethanol.""Why not conduct research to manufacture batteries using raw materials available in India? The auto sector should also explore research in green hydrogen and ethanol,"" PM Modi said. He also highlighted the work being done in the infrastructure sector.""We are challenging seas and mountains, and building engineering marvels in record time. From Atal Tunnel to Atal Setu, India's infrastructural development is creating new records. In the last 10 years, 75 new airports have been built. Around 4 lakh rural roads have been constructed,"" he said. ""Fast-Tag technology is facilitating savings in fuel and time in the industry,"" he affirmed. Citing a recent study, the Prime Minister noted that Fast-Tag technology is contributing to an annual benefit of Rs 40,000 crore to the economy.He also said that due to the efforts of the government in the last 10 years, about 25 crore people have come out of poverty and a new middle class is emerging and means of transportation such as cycles, two-wheelers or four-wheelers, become their first requirement. ""Mobility sector is witnessing an unprecedented atmosphere in the country and you must capitalize on it.""He said that about 4 lakh km of rural roads have been laid, 90,000 km of national highways have been constructed, 3500 km of high-speed corridors have been developed, and 15 new cities got Metro rails. ""The speed and scale of our government has changed the very definition of mobility in India,"" he said adding India is now on the threshold of becoming a global economic powerhouse.He added that there are immense possibilities in the mobility sector in the next 25 years and urged the industry to transform itself rapidly to fully utilize these possibilities.

It charts a course for equitable and sustainable agricultural expansion by extending direct financial assistance via the PM-Kisan Samman Yojana, implementing farmer-centric policies, and fostering innovation.The FM affirmed the government's ongoing fiscal consolidation efforts, aiming to reduce the budget deficit to below 4.5 percent by 2025-26. The projected budget deficit for 2024-25 is 5.1 percent of the GDP.

This move is expected to significantly benefit companies in the rapidly advancing space sector by providing them with resources for innovation and extensive research across various space technology domains. Additionally, the newly introduced programme to bolster deep tech in the defence sector holds transformational potential, given the intrinsic connection between space and the military.The Finance Minister underscored the momentum for 'Nari Shakti’, highlighting the disbursement of 30 crore MUDRA Yojana loans to women entrepreneurs. The initiative, launched in 2015-2016 with an initial disbursement of around Rs 13 lakh crore, has now increased to Rs 45 lakh crore in 2022-2023. These loans are poised to empower women entrepreneurs, enabling them to initiate or expand their enterprises, generate additional employment opportunities, and contribute significantly to the nation's economic advancement.The continued emphasis on infrastructure, with an augmented allocation of Rs. 11.11 lakh crore in FY25, will play a pivotal role in propelling India's economic growth. The announcement on three major economic railway corridors is going to lay a strong foundation for  making the ‘Make in India’ agenda a great success.

The cement maker, which booked a 67 percent surge in Q3 net profit, said that its net debt position marginally increased by the end of December 2023 due to increase in capex cashflow and working capital.""This year, our capex cash flow will exceed our initial estimate, which we have outlined, and we will spend around Rs 9,000 crore. Next year, too, we could see our cash flows on capex being around Rs 9,000 crore. Working capital has taken up some opportunistic bets on purchase of coal and pet coke,"" Daga said in an analysts call.The analysts call was held on January 19, but its recording and transcript was made available only earlier this week.UltraTech is confident of the demand and sees utilisation rate in the 80-85 percent range in the fourth quarter, up than 77 percent in the third quarter. ""The Q4 will be a high throughput quarter, we should be seeing a further improvement in our cash flows and shrinking net debt... We are working towards reaching a zero net debt position by the end of March 2025,"" Daga said.The cement major's profit climbed to Rs 1,774.78 crore in the three months ended December 2023 from Rs 1,062.58 crore a year earlier, revenue from operations climbed 7 percent to Rs 16,739.97 crore. Lower input costs helped the company protect its margins.Expansion plans The company said in November that it would acquire the cement business of the BK Birla Group's Kesoram Industries in an all-stock deal in a bid to expand its capacity amid intense competition for market share in the cement business.""The effective date of merger has been kept on April 1, 2024. And, as and when the merger gets completed, the numbers will be consolidated with retrospective effect once all regulatory approvals are in place,"" Daga said.Asked if the company is pursuing more inorganic purchases, he said: ""Inorganic is always opportunistic and each transaction has to be examined on its fitment with UltraTech given the fact that we are pretty densely present in the country."""

It offers easy access to stories published on Moneycontrol Pro and gives a little extra by setting out a context or an event or trend that investors should keep track of. A message that comes through clearly from the Interim Budget 2024 is that the government is done with the heavy lifting to keep economic activity on course. In keeping with the glide path to arrive at the much-lauded fiscal deficit of 5.1 per cent in FY2025 and even better 4.5 per cent in FY2026, there was restraint in government capex. The 11 per cent expansion in capex growth on the FY2024 estimates and around 15-16 per cent on the revised estimates for FY2024 are indeed the best that was possible.The government’s expectation is that the private sector will take over the reins of capex. Will this happen? And if so, how soon? Indeed, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman evocatively mentioned in her Budget speech that private investments are happening on scale. This may not be unlikely in the long term given the conviction the world has in India growing at the fastest rate in the coming years.But there are reasons to believe that private sector investments could take longer than expected.One, per the Reserve Bank of India’s January 2024 report, credit growth to industry at 8.1 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) in December 2023 was lower than 8.6 per cent in December 2022. In fact, credit to large industries and also to ‘basic metal & metal products, ‘chemicals & chemical products’ and ‘infrastructure’ decelerated.Two, the December quarter results of most manufacturing companies reported a performance beat that was driven more on account of lower costs than sales expansion. In fact, the lead discretionary spend indicators such as auto and FMCGs saw subdued sales growth.In this context, the Budget fell short on expectations of incentives to spur private capex. “More than sops, employment generation which follows private capital expenditure, is expected to help pull up rural consumption,” says Ananya Roy in this article. Some industry veterans state that in its quest for fiscal consolidation, the government steered clear of putting money in citizen’s pockets. The lack of rural incentives may exacerbate the already languishing demand for goods and services from this segment.Three, the order flows of most infrastructure-linked companies that drive capex in core sectors too were subdued in the recent quarterly results. This is unlikely to improve in the near term due to elections round the corner.Of course, the hope is that lower borrowings of the government will finally nudge the RBI to lower rates that could bring a whiff of optimism both in companies and in consumers. And, if the present government is back for another term, it has chances to alter any misses in the July Budget.The strong rebound in the markets suggests that the Government has won over  investors with its trick and treat approach. The treat surely is the fiscal glide path, while the trick is passing the baton of capex to the private sector, which may however, take time.Investing insights from our research teamAuto sales in January 2024 showed a mixed trendTitan Company: Glittering growth prospectsRBI's move puts an end to Paytm’s elusive banking dreamMaruti Q3 FY24: Drives ahead with strong momentum, utility vehicles in the driver's seatDabur India: Cautiously optimisticWhat else are we reading?MC Pro Inside Edge: SME I-bankers’ package deal, Surya story brightens, PSU rally confounds veterans, Sanghi Inds bullsLessons to learn from the Paytm debacleAre central government finances now in better shape than before the pandemic?Success in non-cigarettes business a mixed blessing for ITCThe Budget was a prudent one, the government should reform the project clearance processTen-year sovereign bond to trade below 7 percent in near termThe cycle vs the trend: Investors need to prepare for secular change(republished from the FT)Jharkhand Political Crisis: Can Champai Soren hold the JMM together?Leave No One Behind: The philosophy underpinning the Interim BudgetUnion Budget a roadmap for unleashing India’s entrepreneurial spirit, delivering Viksit BharatBudget’s transport focus is commendable.

We have come out with a facility for updation of return. 56 lakh updated returns updated and garnered around Rs 4,600 crore taxes from that,"" Gupta said.The Interim Budget 2024-25 has announced withdrawal of outstanding small tax demands, some even dating back to 1962, of up to Rs 25,000 till 2014-15 in respect of income, wealth and gift taxes. There are about 1.11 crore such disputed demand entries and the aggregate tax demand involved is Rs 3,500-3,600 crore.Gupta said the move would benefit about 80 lakh unique taxpayers.""Small tax demand we are tackling in that (withdrawal of demands) manner and large tax demand we are tackling separately (through demand management centre). We think this exercise would yield quite a lot of dividend to us and we will be able to manage the demand in a more meaningful way,"" Gupta said.With regard to withdrawal of disputed demands which is announced in Budget, Gupta said most of these demands are on the books.There could be cases where the taxpayer has already paid the tax demand but it has not been updated on the system because it's an old demand when everything was manual. Some of the demand could be fictitious as well in that sense, because it is already been paid or not payable by taxpayer but no one has record of this, Gupta explained.""So to do away with all these and reduce grievances of taxpayers, this is a step we have taken. We believe that a number of entries of that nature what the Finance Minister has spoken about in budget speech could be a crore or more of the number of entries and number of taxpayers could be 80 lakh or so unique ones,"" he said, adding with this exercise the department can clean its books and it would be beneficial for taxpayers as well.""The amount Rs 3,500 crore (which is being withdrawn) would be insignificant compared to what we are collecting annually Rs 19.45 lakh crore. This is the right time to do exercise on that front as well and focus on collection of big demand. The manpower is limited and the effort that we will put in to recover or rectify would be much more than the benefit,"" Gupta said.The budget 2022-23 had announced a scheme for filing updated returns in ITR-U form. The form can be filed within 2 years of the end of the relevant assessment year, and taxpayers will have to give reasons for updating the income -- return previously not filed or income not reported correctly or wrong heads of income chosen or reduction of carried forward loss."

This is based on a continued path of gradual deficit reduction, as well as robust nominal growth of around 10.5 per cent of GDP.In the interim Budget 2024-25, presented in Parliament on Thursday, the government revised lower its current year fiscal deficit to 5.8 per cent from 5.9 per cent budgeted earlier.The deficit, which is the gap between the government's revenue and expenditure, will come down to 5.1 per cent in 2024-25 and further to 4.5 per cent by 2025-26.Fitch said this demonstrates a firm desire to adhere to a path of gradual fiscal consolidation even amid an election year.""The budget presented on Thursday was broadly in line with our expectations, though with a slightly faster pace of deficit reduction, from when we affirmed India's 'BBB-' rating with a Stable Outlook in January.""As such, it does not significantly change the sovereign credit profile. India's fiscal deficit and government debt ratio are high relative to peer medians, but the government's emphasis on deficit reduction helps to stabilise the debt ratio over the medium term,"" Zook said.This Budget was important in signalling the current government's clear commitment to fiscal consolidation and its capex agenda, should it return to office, he added.The government had earlier estimated that the fiscal deficit will come down to 5.4 per cent in the next financial year, beginning from April 1, 2024.However, in the interim Budget, it bettered its estimates to 5.1 per cent of GDP.""Our current forecast is for the deficit to reach 5.4 per cent of GDP in FY25, above the budget target due to more conservative revenue forecasts in the next year. But the government has shown a recent record of achieving fiscal targets, which gives credibility for it to reach the 5.1 per cent target,"" Zook said.Replying to a question in the post-budget conference on her message to rating agencies, Sitharaman said: ""Not only aligning with the fiscal consolidation roadmap that we gave earlier, but bettering it -- that is one simple, straight forward message that every rating agency should take on board."" Higher dividends from banks and financial institutions, apart from improvement in tax mobilisation, would help achieve the fiscal deficit glide path.All three global rating agencies -- Fitch, S&P and Moody's -- have the lowest investment grade rating on India, with a stable outlook. The ratings are looked at by investors as a barometer of the country's creditworthiness and impact borrowing of companies.On Thursday, Moody's Investors Service had said that the interim budget for 2024-25 firmly conveys the government's commitment to its fiscal consolidation goals, set against a backdrop of healthy economic growth.The government demonstrated fiscal restraint in not resorting to large handouts or increasing discretionary spending ahead of this year's elections, Moody's Investors Service Senior Vice President Christian de Guzman had said."

Rate cuts will likely only begin in the second half of 2024 as headline inflation stabilises nearer to the 4% target midpoint,"" said Aditi Raman, associate economist at Moody's Analytics.""While there is a risk of inflation breaching the 6% upper limit, the RBI is likely to monitor commodity and food prices closely.""Although there was no clear consensus around the timing of the first rate cut, a significant minority, 25 of 56, forecast the easing would start in the third quarter. Only 18 of those expected the first cut before July.Those expectations were despite inflation mostly predicted to remain above 4% this year and next.""The RBI finds itself in a reasonably comfortable position... the economy continues to be in a Goldilocks phase, with growth broadly steady, seemingly without resulting in demand-side inflationary pressures, yet,"" noted Rahul Bajoria, chief EM Asia economist at Barclays.The economy was forecast to grow 6.9% this fiscal year and 6.3% in FY 2024-25, a separate Reuters poll showed.In her latest annual budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India would reduce its budget gap sharply in fiscal year 2024-25 and focus on infrastructure and long-term reforms to drive growth.The government reduced its fiscal deficit target to 5.1% of GDP in 2024-25 from 5.8% this year."

There’s likely to be an increase in dealmaking in industrials, manufacturing, information technology services and insurance, as well as some consolidation among shadow banks, he said.Deal volume has been growing as financial sponsors, pension and sovereign wealth funds from places such as the US, Canada and Singapore snap up controlling stakes in Indian infrastructure companies, real estate and green energy to ride on the country’s economic growth. The booming stock market helps, with the benchmark Sensex advancing in each of the past eight years.“India is moving to a different orbit,” Saraf said. “We will continue to do well, irrespective of whether China is doing well or not. We’ll continue to grow and we’ll continue to attract capital.”An aggressive second wave of buying by private equity, sovereign and pension funds that already have a presence in India is likely as they have come to understand conditions in the country much better, according to Saraf.Among them, Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Pte plans to commit as much as $10 billion in three years and expand its headcount, betting that the country can become a top growth driver, its India head said in an interview in July. Bain Capital has also earmarked $7 billion to invest in India in the next three to five years and intends to enlarge its team, Bloomberg News reported Thursday.“We’re seeing mid-size companies mushrooming from every corner of the country, getting sold for $500 million, $800 million — some of them I’ve not heard of in my life,” Saraf said. “The tail of companies and businesses and opportunities is so thick that there’s enough and more for everybody.”The Middle East corridor is looking busy too, with the United Arab Emirates considering investing as much as $50 billion in India, Bloomberg reported in November. Some of the investments could involve sovereign wealth funds such as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Mubadala Investment Co. and ADQ.“Middle East funds will look to India to buy infrastructure, digital and industrial assets,” Saraf said. “There will be more funds into India than in the past.”Citi should get a decent portion of the fee pool after bagging a 12% share from announced India deals last year, Saraf added, describing that as “great” for “one bank in a 25 bank market.”"

The government amended the FRBM law to say that this target should be achieved by the end of 2024-25.However, the COVID pandemic sent public debt soaring across the world, including in India, as governments borrowed heavily to support their economies amid crashing tax collections and activity coming to a standstill.

This agenda not only fosters consumption patterns and economic growth but also addresses immediate needs of individuals. Additionally, investment in infrastructure, particularly in areas like roads, railways, airports, urban transportation is crucial for India's progress.A robust infrastructure network is essential for the nation to grow and provide access to every part of the country to thrive. Moreover, the focus on tourism, especially spiritual tourism exemplified by the interest in Ayodhya, indicates significant potential. India stands on the brink of a tourism boom, albeit requiring significant improvements in infrastructure and services to fully capitalise on this opportunity.Infrastructure Push And InclusionThe Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today increased the outlay on infrastructure by 11.1 percent to Rs 11,11,111 crore ($133 billion). The three new rail corridors, viability funding to build an initial 1 GW of offshore wind, expansion of metro rail networks, as well redevelopment of existing airports and building new ones augur well. The projects will improve efficiency and reduce the cost of logistics.Within the fiscal available ambit, the government is channelling enough for capex which is almost 40 percent of the additional total outlay. This is being directed to roads, railways and defence and it can have positive linkage effects with industries like steel, cement, capital goods etc. Further, the states would continue to get around Rs 1.3 lakh crore from the Centre and would be expected to also ramp up their spending.The additional building of two crore houses (already 4 crore houses have been built for the rural poor) under the PM Awas Yojana (Grameen) in the next 5 years can have a strong economic impact. In India, ensuring accessibility to affordable housing remains a key component. This initiative not only benefits the middle and lower segments of society but also promotes positive momentum in the financial sector, particularly in terms of lending. The crucial aspect to consider is the form housing will take—whether it's through support mechanisms, individual investment, or emotional attachment. Regardless, housing has the potential to significantly boost economic growth.At the heart of it, the Finance Minister's emphasis on building an aspirational India and Indians is reflective in the budget allocation and focus. This suggests that consumption patterns – both in rural and urban areas will likely see an uptick. While expenditures on items like cars, homes, travel, and discretionary spending may increase gradually, there will also be a notable rise in basic necessities and small business investments, such as vehicles for transportation and office equipment. Indians are increasingly embracing spending, evident in the continued use of credit cards and personal loans. This signifies a broadening spectrum of consumption habits across different sectors of the economy.The decision to increase the target of “lakhpati didis” is another indicator of the success of skill development training to women in self-help groups (SHGs). Also, setting up a Rs 1 lakh-crore fund for research and innovation, and increasing tax exemption for start-ups are positives.Overall not much was expected from a “vote on account” budget but the FM laid a roadmap for India to be a $7 trillion economy and the areas of focus to achieve the same noteworthy changes were made in direct or indirect tax.  The decisions taken in the budget will not only help the development of advanced 21st-century infrastructure but also lead to the generation of ""countless"" new employment opportunities.Shanti Ekambaram is Whole-Time Director, Kotak Mahindra Bank.

Very rarely one has seen an interim budget devoid of populist measures in an election year,"The budget for 2024-25 (FY25) is a dream budget for economists. By staying fiscally conservative (lower-than expected fiscal deficit to GDP ratios for FY24 and FY25, lower-than-expected market borrowings for FY25 and non-rosy assumptions for tax receipts), the government has highlighted the importance of fiscal discipline.This was absolutely needed, as India’s public debt is expected to rise to 82.3 percent of GDP by FY25, as per the IMF’s assessment. This relatively aggressive path for fiscal consolidation is facilitated not just by the nation’s smarter recovery from the pandemic but also by the improved sense of ‘political stability.’ Very rarely one has seen an interim budget devoid of populist measures in an election year.Despite a growth of 12.5 percent in the gross tax revenue (revised over actual) in FY24, the government has pegged its growth at 11.5 percent in FY25, aligning it with the expected nominal GDP growth of 10.5 percent. Given the increased economic uncertainty during FY25 (due to global slowdown, climate risks, geopolitical stresses, etc.), we would bifurcate the nominal GDP growth into a real GDP growth of 6 percent and an inflation of 4.5 percent. This looks reasonable given that the RBI has broken the back of inflation through its sustained monetary tightening.What is noteworthy is that the government is trying to achieve fiscal consolidation without compromising the quality of public expenditure. While the current expenditure is expected to increase marginally by 3.5 percent in FY25 (budgeted over revised), the capital spending by the government is budgeted to grow by 16.9 percent in FY25 over the revised print for FY24. This will take the government’s capex to Rs 11.11 trillion in FY25, which will be 3.4 percent of GDP versus 2.5 percent in FY22.In FY24, a huge shortfall of disinvestment receipts (actual at Rs 300 billion versus the budgeted Rs 610 billion) was compensated by a much higher dividend by the RBI, banks and FIs to the tune of Rs 1,044 billion versus the budgeted Rs 480 billion. While the RBI could garner substantial profits during FY24 in foreign-currency trading and by lending more to the banking system at higher interest rates, the banking system too benefited from a faster expansion of net interest margins. By assuming the same phenomena to continue in the next year, the government has budgeted the ‘dividend from RBI/banks/FIs’ at Rs 1,020 billion in FY25.As the government has managed to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.8 percent in FY24 (versus the budgeted at 5.9 percent) and intends to lower it further to 5.1 percent in FY25 (versus the market expectation of 5.4 percent-5.5 percent), the net market borrowings (G-Sec) are pegged at Rs 11.752 trillion in FY25 versus Rs 11.805 trillion in FY24. This has fueled a rally in the bonds market without any monetary easing.From the expenditure side, continued spending on infrastructure, MGNREGA and a boost to rural housing and agri-allied activities will certainly act as income stabilisers in a bad agricultural year (patchy monsoon, low water reservoir levels, etc.).By presenting a fiscally prudent ‘interim budget,’ the government has underscored the role of ‘fiscal discipline’ in supporting economic stability. This will help India maintain financial stability at times of heightened market stress.Dr Rupa Rege Nitsure is Chief Economist, L&T Finance Holdings Ltd.

The brokerage expects that the company’s focus on Average Selling Price (ASP) and margin would increase profitability if the new launches are successful. Nomura expects this is the correct strategy for the EV market as the market will become more competitive at the lower price point.Motilal Oswal also expects the JLR volumes to be strong going forward due to easing chip shortages and traction for the new launches.Brokerages are also eyeing a strong EBITDA margin for Tata Motors in Q3 due to better pricing.

It pegged the Government of India’s (GoI) fiscal deficit at 5.1 percent of GDP for the next fiscal, midway through the revised estimate of 5.8 percent for FY2024 and the medium-term fiscal deficit target of 4.5 percent for FY2026. Accordingly, the gross and net market borrowings for GoI for FY2025 have been curtailed to Rs 14.13 lakh crore and Rs 11.75 lakh crore, respectively, from the Rs 15.43 lakh crore and Rs 11.80 Lakh crore, respectively, estimated for FY2024.Lower borrowing costs for corporates and treasury gains for banks: The yield on 10-year benchmark GoI security had already opened lower by 2bps at 7.12 percent after the positive commentary by US Federal Reserve about the inflation trajectory. It gained further momentum after the lower-than-expected fiscal deficit numbers for FY2024 and FY2025. The yield on benchmark security rallied to 7.05 percent after the budget announcement before a partial reversal. The decline in risk-free benchmark will provide shore up treasury profits for banks. A decline in the risk-free rate will also drive lower yields on the corporate bonds, making it cheaper for large well-rated corporations to borrow funds from the debt capital market.Challenges in passing on rising cost of deposit for banks: These developments may however mean that the ability of the banks to pass-on the rising cost of deposits by way of hiking lending rates may get constrained. Given the tight liquidity in the banking system, which is likely to continue for a few months, there will be a sustained pressure on the deposit costs of the banks, and this could mean higher pressure on their interest margins, especially while lending to larger corporations. A meaningful shift to the debt capital market by larger corporations could also mean slower credit growth, which coupled with pressure on interest margin may constrain the earnings growth momentum of banks seen in the recent past.Corporate bond issuances to improve: While we expect the corporate bond yields to decline, which may benefit the larger well-rated corporations that can borrow meaningfully from debt capital markets, tighter liquidity situations may result in some widening of the spreads for corporate bonds over the risk-free rate. Nonetheless, higher credit spreads and lower market borrowings of GoI shall improve the investor’s appetite for corporate bonds, which shall augur well growth of debt capital markets. Non-bank finance companies (NBFCs), which are facing some funding challenges after the increase in risk weight on bank lending to NBFCs are already the biggest borrowers in the debt capital market. The evolving dynamics between bank funding and debt capital market funding cost, shall further incentivise the NBFCs to increase their share borrowings from capital markets to fund their growth.Insurance sector to face higher competition: No capitalisation plans for the weak public sector general insurance companies, which are severely under-capitalised, remains a surprise though one cannot rule out capital support in FY2025. At the same time, fall in market yields amidst attractive rates on bank deposits could pose challenges for the individual new premium growth for the life insurance industry.Housing and infrastructure sector shall provide growth opportunities:Coming to the specific budgetary announcements; the announcement for two crore houses over next five years in rural areas and plans to launch a housing scheme for the middle class shall provide ample growth opportunities for housing finance. Further enhanced outlay for infrastructure spending with focus on railways, aviation, green energy, and electric vehicles shall also provide ample growth opportunities for banks and financial institutions.Overall, the decline in bond yields shall pose higher competition for banks and constrain their ability to pass on the rising cost of the deposits to borrowers as borrowings through debt capital markets are poised to become slightly more attractive. This is also expected to put pressure on credit growth, which we expect to slow down to 11.7-12.6 percent in FY2025 from 14.9-15.3 percent in FY2024. As we expect the onset of a shallow rate cut cycle of 50-75 bps beginning August 2024, the interest margins may further come under pressure for banks, which could pressurise their earnings growth after significant momentum seen during the last few years.Karthik Srinivasan is Group Head, Financial Sector Ratings, ICRA Ltd.

In 2019, the BJP-led NDA was on the backfoot and was forced to announce a quarterly stipend for farmers and direct tax concessions for the lower middle class","Contrary to expectations, the interim union budget ignored the temptation to go populist ahead of the upcoming general election.Instead, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, presenting her sixth Budget, focused on sustaining the remarkable growth trajectory of 7 percent, while improving on the promised glide path for fiscal consolidation—providing welcome room for maneuvering to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the conduct of its monetary policy.In a speech lasting less than an hour – the shortest in recent memory – the FM unambiguously showcased her government’s confidence in returning to power in the general election based on its track record and not promises of freebies.Further, the NDA reiterated its conviction about the ideological pivot – preferring entitlement over empowerment – it undertook in the last 10 years to deliver near saturation in basics like electricity, toilets, banking, cooking gas and substantial success in providing tapped drinking water and housing. This strategy of teaching people how to fish has impacted over 50 crore people.To put it another way, a decade ago this cohort was outside the formal economy looking in. Today, they are stakeholders in the growth process. This fundamental shift is the new political economy of India.Understandable then that the NDA is seeking to make the upcoming electoral battle one for this idea of India.Undoubtedly, the FM was emboldened by the fact that unlike in 2019, the opposition was missing in action in the run-up to this year’s interim Budget. Five years ago, an opposition riding on a string of assembly election wins against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), managed to grab national attention with its compelling narrative of rural distress.In fact, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was on the backfoot and was forced to announce a quarterly stipend for farmers and direct tax concessions for the lower middle class. Five years later, the change in circumstances is remarkable.No finance minister has approached a union budget, leave alone a pre-election effort from an incumbent facing a two-term anti-incumbency, in such relatively stable macroeconomic circumstances.Inflation has peaked and is decelerating from the high of 7.8 percent recorded in the post-Ukraine conflict phase; economic growth dramatically rebounded and is projected to grow at a very impressive 7.3 percent in 2023-24 – in fact, some analysts believe India has struck out on a new trend rate of growth of 7 percent; in turn, the acceleration in growth is ensuring revenue growth, strengthening the ongoing fiscal consolidation; the country’s foreign currency reserves are comfortable and the Indian rupee seems to have seen off the worst.At the same time the NDA has substantially improved on the track record of its predecessor, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), in ensuring that  gains of development are distributed.Ironically, it did so by using Aadhaar, which was rolled out by the UPA in 2009, to build a delivery architecture pinpointing the beneficiary. It did so by creating a kind of an economic GPS by combining a beneficiary’s Aadhaar, Jandhan bank account and mobile (JAM).In the past 10 years the NDA transferred Rs 34 lakh crore in benefits, saving the exchequer Rs 2.75 lakh crore in leakages. The twin gains of delivering development while cracking down on graft, is no doubt yielding valuable social capital for the NDA.Further, beginning with its plan to build toilets in every home – announced by PM Modi in his first Independence Day address in 2014 – the NDA placed women at the centre of all policy initiatives. The passage of the women’s reservation bill in legislatures last September, only confirmed the NDA’s intent to target the X-factor.Significant, because exit polls in the recent round of elections to the Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh state assembly showed that overwhelming support from the cohort of women swung the election in favour of the Congress and BJP, respectively.In the final analysis it is clear that the NDA has seized the fortuitous economic circumstances, a disoriented opposition and the opportunity to tap the social capital it earned through its development initiatives, to try and get a head start in the general election campaign.The battle for the hearts and minds of India’s electorate has begun.Anil Padmanabhan is a senior journalist.

Here, Moneycontrol tells you which numbers matter the most and what they mean for the economy in 2024-25","The Union Budget for 2024-25, presented on February 1, was a vote-on-account with the Lok Sabha elections due in April-May. The full budget will be presented by the next government in July.But that does not mean the set of numbers that have been presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman can be ignored. The Interim Budget, like a full one, contains thousands of numbers, one as important as the next. Here, Moneycontrol tells you which numbers matter the most and what they mean for the economy in 2024-25.Size and deficitThe total size of the 2024-25 Budget stands at Rs 47.66 lakh crore — 6.1 percent bigger than the revised estimate for 2023-24. To help meet the gap between its income and expenditure of Rs 16.85 lakh crore, or the fiscal deficit, pegged at lower-than-expected 5.1 percent of the GDP, the Centre will borrow Rs 14.13 lakh crore from the market by issuing bonds.On a net basis, after adjusting for the payments it will make for bonds maturing the next financial year, the Centre's borrowing programme has been estimated at Rs 11.75 lakh crore.Key Numbers of 2024-25 Budget (in Rs lakh crore)FY25 BEFY24 RE% changeTotal Receipts47.6644.906.1%    Gross Tax Revenue38.3134.3711.5%    Non-tax Revenue4.003.766.4%Total Expenditure 47.6644.906.1%    Capital Expenditure11.119.5016.9%Fiscal Deficit16.8517.35-2.8%Gross Market Borrowing 14.1315.43-8.4%When it comes to spending the money, the government earns and borrows, capital expenditure remains the dominant force.At Rs 11.11 lakh crore, the Centre's capex target for 2024-25 is at a fresh record high and 16.9 percent higher than the revised estimate for this year. As expected, the Centre has missed its Rs 10-lakh-crore target for 2023-24 by around Rs 50,000 crore.On the receipts front, the finance ministry continues to remain realistic. The Budget estimates that the Centre's gross tax collections will rise to Rs 38.31 lakh crore in 2024-25, up 11.5 percent from the revised estimate for this year. Net tax revenues — arrived at after adjusting for transfers to states —are seen rising 11.9 percent to Rs 26.02 lakh crore.Within taxes, corporate and income tax collections are seen rising 13 percent and 13.1 percent. Excise duty collections are pegged 5 percent above this year's revised estimate at Rs 3.19 lakh crore, while the Centre's Goods and Services Tax collections are seen rising 13.1 percent to Rs 9.18 lakh crore.Revenue Break-up (in Rs lakh crore)FY25 BEFY24 RE% changeGross Tax Revenue38.3134.3711.5%  Net Tax Revenue26.0223.2411.9%    Corporation Tax10.439.2313.0%    Personal Income Tax11.5610.2213.1%    Customs2.312.195.8%    Excise3.193.045.0%    Central GST9.188.1213.1%Non-tax Revenue4.003.766.4%    Disinvestment0.500.3066.7%    RBI, PSU bank Dividend1.021.04-2.3%Non-tax revenue for the next financial year has been pegged at Rs 4 lakh crore, up 6.4 percent. The two key components of non-tax revenue are disinvestments and dividends from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and public sector banks. While the former has been pegged at Rs 50,000 crore, the central and public sector banks are expected to give a dividend of Rs 1.02 crore next year.On the whole, Sitharaman has been far more aggressive in consolidating the Centre's finances than was expected. But the real test will come first in the Lok Sabha elections and then the full Budget in July where - as the finance minister confidently said in her speech: ""Our government will present a detailed roadmap for our pursuit of 'Viksit Bharat'."""

This vaccine is designed to offer protection against specific strains of cervical cancer.As per data from the HPV Information Centre, India faces a considerable risk of cervical cancer, with a population of 511.4 million women aged 15 years and older who are potentially susceptible to the disease.According to data from 2020, every year 1,23,907 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 77,348 die from the disease. Cervical cancer ranks as the second most frequent cancer among women in India.Currently, there are different types of HPV vaccines that protect against different types of infections. American multinational Merck's HPV shot Gardasil is also available in the market at Rs 10,850. Another product Cervarix by GSK was withdrawn in India in 2022.In 2023, the nation rolled out India’s first indigenously developed Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus vaccine ‘CERVAVAC’. It was a partnership between Serum Institute Of India (SII), Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) along with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. One dose of the product is priced around Rs 2000 currently.""I applaud the Indian government's announcement to vaccinate girls aged 9-14 against cervical cancer. Let's pledge to prevent HPV and ensure easy access to vaccination,"" said Adar Poonawalla CEO of the Serum Institute of India in a post on social media platform X.The HPV vaccine is typically administered in a series of shots over several months. The recommended age for vaccination is usually 11 or 12 years old, but it can be given as early as age 9.""Women between 27 to 45 years of age can get the HPV Vaccine, however getting it administered at these ages, reduces the effectiveness of the vaccine and should be taken after proper consultation with a gynecologist. HPV Vaccines have a success rate of 88 percent,"" said Dr Rama Joshi , Principal Director , Department of Gynae Oncology , Fortis Hospital, Gurgaon.Research suggests that vaccine protection is long-lasting. Current studies have followed vaccinated individuals for ten years, and show that there is no evidence of weakened protection over time.The National Technical Advisory Group for Immunization (NTAGI) in 2022 recommended HPV vaccination for girls aged nine to 14 as a part of the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). It was advised to set up vaccination centres in schools and promote awareness about the vaccination.""Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer among women in India, and its vaccination is recommended before the girl child attains puberty to maximise its benefits. Getting protected against the disease through effective immunisation and enabling early detection are two crucial steps that can help us save close to 1,25,000 women every year,"" said Dr Kshitiz Murdia – CEO & CO-Founder of Indira IVF .Also read:  FM Sitharaman promises more medical colleges, healthcare boost in interim budget"
709,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/interim-budget-seeks-to-decouple-budget-making-from-long-term-policy-goals-12170871.html,Interim Budget seeks to decouple budget-making from long-term policy goals,"February 01, 2024 01:26 PM IST",FM Sitharaman walks the talk on fiscal discipline. The finance minister has put the accent on the hour hand of the clock by looking ahead a quarter century hence (2047) and free-up policymaking mindspace from annual financial calendars,"On December 7, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman sought to temper down expectations about the Interim Budget, which she said will be“nothing spectacular”. She broadly stuck to that line on February 1. That said, Sitharaman’s interim budget for 2024-25 stood out for two distinct characteristics.For one, it sought to strike a distinction on accounting and policy making. Annual budgets, by definition, need to be just that: a plan on how to spend and how to earn. This includes borrowing too. Governments, like households, cannot finance all their expenses from current earnings. For instance, a family mostly buys a house on a loan. It is an asset that is funded over the medium term and has inter-generational needs. Similarly, for the government too. A good marker of prudent public finance management is to gauge how much borrowed money is being spent on financing asset creation, such as roads and ports, which will not only serve generations of people, but also unleash strong economic multipliers.To this effect, Sitharaman’s interim budget for 2024-25 stood out for its unwavering focus on capital expenditure. She has pencilled in a total government capital expenditure spend of Rs 11.1 lakh crore in 2024-25, up 11.1 percent in 2023-24. During the year, the government's fiscal deficit has been projected to fall to 5.1 percent of GDP, from 5.8 percent in 2023-24, demonstrating the government’s intent to walk the talk on fiscal discipline, withstanding ostensible pressures to present a populist budget in an election year.The interim budget’s fiscal math makes it clear that capital expenditure or asset creation is where the emphasis will be sharply focussed on. The net market borrowings for 2024-25 is projected at Rs 11 lakh crore, which is about the levels of what the government intends to spend on infrastructure asset creation as mirrored in the capital expenditure plans.Whether pre-election populist promises yield votes and swing poll results need deeper research and data. It is nobody’s case that in a 1.4 billion-strong nation, in which nearly one in every three live below the poverty line, one needs an effective and efficient method through which privileged tax payers can support the poor.But, this should not come at the cost of unending borrowing to fulfil poll promises about freebies that are not carefully fiscally weighed. It may be good electorally, but is certainly not good public finance management, which is something the finance minister seems to have been guided by.Offering freebies through non-merit subsidies carries the worrying risk of making the voting process a transactional activity in a different hue. It is characteristic of a promissory note that is not always founded on sound economic principles. The focus should rather be on empowering voters through health, education, and infrastructure.The other stand out characteristic of the interim budget, is more nuanced. It signals a distinctive departure to decouple policymaking from the annual budget accounting exercise. The goals for 2047 are a case in point. These define the long-term macroeconomic and socio-economic goals within a broad matrix that the country should seek to accomplish.Policymaking is the art of the possible. Seeking to look 25 years ahead is similar to putting the accent on long-term milestones. It also enables us to break down the long-term goals into smaller milestones that can be achieved every five to 10 years. Short-termism in policymaking can often obfuscate the vision. Budget making should seek to take an annual account of longer-term ambitions, and not be dictated primarily by annual or electoral calendars. To that extent, Sitharaman’s interim budget marks a definitive change in attitude."
